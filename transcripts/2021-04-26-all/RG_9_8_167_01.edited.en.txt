Speaker 1 00:00:01.200
This is Soul of Reason a program that tells what's happening in black America. Each week on NBC leaders and movers in the black community visit Soul of Reason to discuss important concerns of black New Yorkers. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. This evening our guest is one of the firefighters. Mr. Robert Turner who's president of the Vulcan Society which is the society of black firemen in New York City and he's particularly interested in talking about the upcoming examination and the importance of having a considerable number of minority candidates. So we're glad to have you with us tonight.

Speaker 2 00:00:49.440
Thanks for allowing me to come and talk about the upcoming examination and the role that the Vulcan Society and New York City residents can play can play in recruiting minorities for a much needed organ today.

Speaker 1 00:01:02.970
OK well let's start out first of all how many firemen are there totally in the fire department in New York City?

Speaker 2 00:01:09.030
Well in New York City we have ten thousand five hundred forty-two firefighters.

Speaker 1 00:01:15.030
Okay and how many of them are black or Hispanic?

Speaker 2 00:01:17.650
Okay we have four hundred and sixty-five black firefighters and one hundred and sixteen Hispanics. And that was our census as of July 1st '77. Since that time we've had additional firefighters added to our force. We've had 97 minorities. I don't have an ethnic breakdown although I am-

Speaker 1 00:01:39.990
And a part of that comes out of a court suit I believe that maybe the Vulcan Society was involved in namely the allegation that the selection procedure an examination or selecting a fireman was biased mainly because of the fact that at least in past years a relatively smaller proportion of the black candidates were hired or passed the test as against the white candidate. Am I correct when I say the Vulcan Society was involved in the suit.

Speaker 2 00:02:08.430
Well we we did we had successful litigation in federal court but it might go a little bit further in January of 77 it was estimated that there were 200000 paid firefighters in the United States and 7000 of these are black. Best to estimate but back in 1969 the Vulcan Society recognize the need for more minorities in the fire service throughout the country. So they proposed a conference of similar organizations in the Northeast region out of that became the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters and we at that time we had a panel on recruiting black youth for the fire service. There was a comprehensive study done by the Balkan Society in New York City in which we devised the mythology to to recruit black youth. We recognized that through the normal recruiting method that they were not responding. So as of the 1971 examination we saw that black youth as predicted did not do well with the normal testing with the normal recruiting. So we went to court on the count the N double ACP legal defense fund. They they sponsored us they provided the legal machine nation for us to be successful.

Speaker 6 00:03:38.070
It was very interesting because we have many guests from many different fields education medicine census firefighting police science and almost every time when it comes to litigation the NAACP or the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund crop up and I think is really important for all of us to recognize the very important role that the civil rights organization plays in bettering conditions for black people because then they will ACP is not always out in the streets. Some people say oh well they're not as militant as they used to be but this is a way of fighting the new racism that the racism of exclusion. And I think it's important to note that this is just an interesting that time after time after time you see that there they are in the forefront.

Speaker 2 00:04:28.160
All right. Well the end double ACP Legal Defense Fund is responsible right. They they provided us with a very very good law firm and some people who were very very interested in dedicated in our behalf. Now I just mentioned a few minutes ago that we've had some new minorities added as a result of our successful litigation 1974 after we came up with a a quota system where we are to set off the imbalance the judge rule that for every three non minorities hired there must be a minority hired. And of course that we saw an influx of black and Hispanic firefighters at that time. Then of course in 1974 when we had to lay off last hired first fired. So we lost them then the fire department found out that they had a dire need in the first part of this year. And they wanted to hire new york city transit policemen rather than New York City policemen because they were involved with women the Vulcan Society once again intervened and we said no we could not be sure that we would see the same type of census being maintained in the fire department by hiring transit policemen or for what they called a. A. Preferred list. So we went back to court and judge y and failed once again ruled in our favor and they reactivated 0 1 5 9. We now see we're going to see 600 firefighters come into New York City Fire Department. And we should see one hundred and fifty minorities now. We unless we have a successful. Recruiting minority recruiting program we will not see these figures again. We just we just haven't done that well.

Speaker 1 00:06:32.680
In other words you have sort of two problems one. Yeah the problem that you're doing right tonight and that is informing the community at large about the situation particularly the black community to you have the problem of getting enough black people and Hispanic people because I think 250 whose blacks and Hispanics correct black people and Hispanic people to apply for the examination. And three you have the problem of having enough of them to pass the examination. And I guess in this instance the smaller qualifying examination because since it says one out of three it doesn't require that the people in the exam all have in the 90s. If the passing grade is let's say 75 they can take any one of the minorities coming down from that from the highest and the minorities on down. Now you're shaking your head. Maybe not. No let me correct that.

Speaker 5 00:07:21.340
That just had to do with the 0 1 5 9 this this was a successful suit that we had that said that that test was unconstitutional. The new exam we are hoping no one bank. Yes we are hoping that this is a constitutional examination that that some of the imbalances that we had before will not exist in this exam. I mean firefighters which traditionally Father and Son and the test was heavily loaded with jargon it was heavily loaded with with job related items which of course gave anyone who had a relative in the fire department an advantage.

Speaker 1 00:08:01.660
Of course you have another problem. One of my areas of personal expertise is test and test development. You do have the problem with the Griggs decision Griggs versus Duke Power in Georgia which said that any test must be job related. And what you screen for must be related to the job. So on one hand is important have items that are really the job on the other hand it's equally important that jargon which is a fancy word for specialized or technical language or in group language shouldn't be used. For example you heard the black intelligence test the right test. Right. When one reason why white people who take it don't do very well and they don't is because it's really in group jargon such as calling the black man of blood that's in group jargon so jargon is bad on any test. And that's one of the things you want to look out for in the firemen's examination and what I guess you're really saying is that you hope that it is fair in terms of the way it is projected that the. For example if the test to see how fast you can climb a ladder you hope that the ladder is appropriately spaced and safe and if anyone can have access to taking that test and hopefully the one who does it the best gets the high score.

Speaker 7 00:09:22.160
OK fine. But we are concerned basically as with the written portion we we argued for and we have successfully gotten a two part examination with 50 percent weight for each part. The blacks have traditionally done very very well on the physical portion of the examination and at one time they had just made it qualifying which meant that you had to have your written Mark was the mark that placed you on the list with a 50 50 mark. We are saying that if you got an eighty five let's say in the written and then you would come from we had about 97 98 in the physical. That would be averaged and that would give you a higher placement. And what you're saying is that the people who get the jobs will be the ones to the top positions on the list. Well we expect 40000 to file and they are talking about maybe using 4000 candidates for the list right. However I want want to make it clear that should not deter anyone. The fire department has a recruiting and tutorial unit. The Vulcan Society I want to go back to that conference in 1969 as a result of that conference there was a paper written that has become the role role model throughout the United States as far as our organizations are concerned for recruiting black youth.

Speaker 8 00:10:46.730
One of our past presidents Captain Vincent Julius was assigned to our community relations bureau and he did an update and he designed a very very comprehensive program for recruiting youth. Unfortunately the Department of personnel who has the constitutional obligation to provide for recruiting and tutoring is not following it the way we like but making the best out of it. We have an active unit in the fire department now this unit has two to two teams. One is to go out and recruit and the other is to tutor any candidate who files an application. And you must file an application filing closes October 25th. But any candidate who files an application will have tutoring available. They will be shown how to take a test and that's so much we're not interested in in knowledge because the knowledge of what you need to know will be on the paper but they will be tutored in test taking because this is where we find that we have problems how to take a test rather than let's say the content of the test.

Speaker 9 00:12:01.550
In other words things like being sure to read the question before you answer it. Be sure that you don't spend too much time on one question things like that.

Speaker 10 00:12:09.230
Right now we are into areas spatial orientation which is memory. And if you look at a picture we will tell you Well now this is what you look for. This is how you're trying to remember this because this is a part of the examination the paragraph interpretation question how to attack how to break that particular question down and find the answer.

Speaker 11 00:12:31.670
So this is the type of things that in our tutorial program you will get tonight on solar reason we are talking with Robert Turner who is president of the Vulcan Society which is the society of black firemen in New York City.

Speaker 9 00:12:45.480
We are particularly interested in the whole idea of recruiting an interesting more minority candidates in the fire department particularly the examination is coming up on October 25th not examined by.

Speaker 11 00:12:57.250
You're right. The examination isn't marked out the filing date closes on October 25 and the exam comes up when December.

Speaker 10 00:13:05.360
1977 that's a Saturday morning.

Speaker 9 00:13:09.220
OK that's very good. So the filing date closes on October 24th.

Speaker 10 00:13:14.540
Now where do the candidates file away work and they get applications and which can happen and a candidate may go to the department of personnel several Manpower employment centers at any firehouse in New York City and receive an application and the application must be filed can be filed by mail or in person. There is a nine dollar filing fee when you found your application that's only step one. You will receive a tutorial booklet.

Speaker 12 00:13:49.180
You will be assigned a tutorial site at at this date. We have 10 tutorial sites and there are they are in each burrow and they're centrally located so that all candidates will be able to attend and they're in high schools and colleges. Well that's a long list but I won't go through the list but by rolling by calling 2 3 3 5 8 2 0 you would be able to get all the information necessary.

Speaker 11 00:14:25.650
Okay. Now that 2 3 3 5 8 2 0 is that the number the Vulcan site a number of fighter pilots Fire Department recruiting unit.

Speaker 12 00:14:32.260
They have lines and two to hand to the candidates questions.

Speaker 11 00:14:38.740
All right now are people who are not residents of New York City eligible to file for this examination.

Speaker 12 00:14:44.350
Yes those who live in the adjoining areas they must be must reside in New York City Nassau or Westchester Suffolk Rockland orange or Putnam Counties. They can file and they can take the examination. This is one of the things that we went down on this year in the legislator.

Speaker 13 00:15:08.830
I understand it has been some legislation introduced to require residency in New York City for positions like fire sanitation education. And there has been some support I think even Governor Perry may have supported this particular legislation the opposition to it of course is that many of the majority group people who live outside of New York City still want to have access to these jobs.

Speaker 14 00:15:36.820
And the argument is that it's difficult to have your loyalty in your home and your taxpaying base outside of the city and serve the city adequately because other people will argue well if you're a professional you're a professional and you don't have to worry about the way you're paying your taxes could you give us Bob the qualifications.

Speaker 13 00:15:57.940
How does their height requirement age requirement sex requirement et cetera.

Speaker 15 00:16:03.490
OK for the first time in New York City the exam is open to men and women. You can at least start this way. You must have passed your 18th birthday but not be more than 29 years old. Twenty nine years of age at the data to test. Now if you were in military service and it's the law is up to six years you can deduct that from your age. In other words I mean you go up to 35 of you in military. That is correct. OK. You must have a high school diploma or an equivalency diploma at the time of appointment at the time of appointment. I want to emphasize that I mentioned that you must live in certain areas at the time of appointment. The height not less than 5 feet 4 inches in bare feet OK then a maximum height.

Speaker 16 00:17:05.780
Know we have some pretty big guys in the fire department. If there is a maximum I don't think that anyone that we see will exceed it in other words Kareem Abdul Jabbar couldn't apply for this test.

Speaker 17 00:17:18.359.9999999998836
Oh I think I think he could.

Speaker 18 00:17:19.790
I think he could really have a hard time with him and sell us what he could apply Vision 20 to for 2014 each eye separately without glasses and 20 30. Both eyes together without glasses at the time of appointment. You must have a valid New York State driver's license. I would just like to mention character because so many of our youth will not file for an examination because they might have had some kind of scrape with the law. Proof of good character will be required for appointment. Now ordinarily you're not eligible if convicted of a felony or dishonorably discharged from the armed forces. Now I use the word ordinarily because they are all ways of getting relief and so don't let this be a bore.

Speaker 17 00:18:13.190
Call 2 3 3 5 8 2 0 and explain your case and see if you can become a candidate or become a successful candidate for a firefighter.

Speaker 16 00:18:25.940
Notice the new term we're using now as firefighter in expectation of having women a part of.

Speaker 19 00:18:31.470
Yeah I noticed you smiled a little wryly when you said that for the first time we're having women women and now because of Title 9 affirmative action being considered for a variety of jobs that they previously weren't considered for including sanitation person sanitation engineer police person.

Speaker 20 00:18:53.030
What impact do you think that women will have on the department.

Speaker 21 00:18:57.260
I know a lot of wives a little uptight because there's a lot of close living in the fire department they say well you shouldn't have that because they will break up some families. Other people say well women aren't strong enough they can't handle the job. What do you think about this. Well I don't have any fears in any of these areas.

Speaker 22 00:19:17.420
I feel that the biggest challenge for the fire department and for the women is to for them both to become professional firefighters. I as a captain who runs a unit I think a challenge would be to have this female come into the firehouse and be able to treat her as a firefighter and to have the female come in and expect to be treated as a firefighter as to whether they can do the job. I have no doubt that a female who passes the examination both the physical and the written in the medical will be able to do was to be a firefighter.

Speaker 20 00:19:54.050
Of course it's a job where the work is orders at times but we see some women who now are playing football who are now playing baseball and in Europe they've had women firefighters for years and other cities have successfully had women doing the Battle of Britain for example at least half the firefighting force or women speaking about this whole emphasis on ethnically identifiable minority candidates. Why other than just the question of opportunity you know giving about an equal opportunity.

Speaker 23 00:20:28.670
Why is it important that there be more black and Hispanic five firefighters on King black and Hispanic firefighters in their community.

Speaker 17 00:20:43.550
They're a positive force. They're positive in the sense that there are a constant recruiting to air constantly. They're very very visible and there are many times in a fire situation in a inspection situation where the citizen really doesn't understand and and in time you don't understand something or you see someone that you're not sure as to what their position is as far as your welfare is concerned you sometimes get a little uptight the black and Hispanic firefighter can be somewhat of a buffer somewhat to be able to kind of explain the situation to let the person know that the law is being applied equally during the time of the riot in 1969.

Speaker 18 00:21:41.940
There were a lot of transfers of black firemen into the community because the fire department recognized the role of firefighters in their community.

Speaker 24 00:21:52.810
We'll close this a two edged sword and it happened most recently with regard to the Board of Education namely that if all minority candidates are most minority candidates are assigned to minority communities. It is alleged that they are being discriminated against and some groups including NAACP have gone to court to say you shouldn't assign all or most minority people to predominantly black schools.

Speaker 20 00:22:18.010
So the sword cuts both ways.

Speaker 18 00:22:20.130
Well I agree.

Speaker 25 00:22:21.040
I'm not saying that I agree that all black firefighters should be assigned to their communities but I do see that there is a value that we are most of the time we're dealing with is tragedy. We're dealing with is confusing and and defining a fight. And once again I want to say that that fire fight is not sensitive and not aware but we talk about people coming from Putnam we talk about coming from Orange coming from Rockland and they're there. Their home structure is different I'm talking about the home itself that they don't live in vertical buildings. They have buildings spread out so sometimes they don't recognize the value of the property. They don't look at the property with the same eye as the community firefighter. Mike I live and I work in my community so every time that I see some structural damage it hurts me because I have a root that I have a base there. I recognize the value when the people come into the firehouse and they have a problem it's my problem. I can identify with and I have the sensitivity to handle it a little bit better. So while I don't condone putting all black firemen in the community I say that they definitely have a place and they should be there.

Speaker 24 00:23:56.730
Yeah of course. Yes. What the idea would be is if there were enough black firemen and Department of firefighters in that department you wouldn't have to make certain special arrangements for assignment because they would be spread throughout the department and you wouldn't have to make any particular consideration. The problem is that with something like 5 percent of your firefighting force only 5 percent 6 percent being Hispanic and black not if you use the total free assignment model you would still have a relatively small number of blacks and Hispanics in any given neighborhood. And I imagine there must be some move to tend to cluster them. But again it is an individual matter. I imagine if every black fireman were assigned to a black firehouse even a Vulcan Society would be a little mad about it.

Speaker 25 00:24:48.110
Oh well some of us was quite mad about the transfers in the 60s. However this is this was the formation of our international that we recognized that we did have a role as community people and we shared our our common problems. And now we have a network throughout the United States where we meet and we share the problems of how to deal with our role as community people. And we have panels we deal with with how can we handle sensitive problems. We deal with what can we do to become leaders in our department. You know because it's all right to be a foot soldier for a while but then you should rise up and become leaders so that you can have an active role in shaping what's going to happen in your community.

Speaker 20 00:25:51.120
I think that's a good point.

Speaker 28 00:25:52.980
I think a lot of people don't realize just how difficult this job is of a fire by a fighter.

Speaker 24 00:25:58.680
I know as I drive through the South Bronx and parts of Harlem but lives in Brownsville where they've been houses that have been burned out right after their fire and you see 30 or 40 families standing on the side and you recognize that most of what they own as either been sold and water has been burned up you really are touched by the tragedy that a fire can bring to any given home. Then when you hear stories and I'm going to be the devil's advocate at this point that the firefighters just go in and just tear the place up that they really don't care too much what happened to the furniture into the wall they just open it up it is tear it up and just do it badly. And of course the allegation is that they do it worse in black communities in poor communities than they do in middle class communities. What about that allegation you've been there. Sure. And you know the real story.

Speaker 26 00:26:58.220
Well New York City firefighters are truly the bravest. I I've I've worked where the action is for 22 years and I've seen firefighters regardless of race color or creed to some very very brave things.

Speaker 25 00:27:18.260
I've seen them going and we're talking about rescuing minority people without any qualm as to who they are or where they are.

Speaker 26 00:27:29.570
Then after the fire is out or when we go through what we call our overhauling stage I become dismayed at some time at at at what I would feel would be the lack of sensitivity to the people's property. Now this is not all firefighters. But we have to recognize that most of our fires are happening in these communities. I mean this is the bulk of our firefighting. And I agree that I'm crying out. And while the department really recognizes this I just don't seem to be able to stem that tie. It's just that the firemen I feel a lot of times could do a little less overhauling and that's the term for opening up and whatever but some of it is done out of being a viciousness. But a lot of it is that people are just not sure they want to make sure is the kind of professional pride where they don't want to come back to put out the same fire again because I imagine a certain amount of frustration because to be fair about it not all black residents or minority residents have loved firefighters I guess three out of four alarms now are false alarms that people turn in maliciously and a lot of people get hurt in those false alarms.

Speaker 28 00:28:47.450
Sometimes firefighters are stoned if it comes during a time of social unrest. So that there might be some frustration on the part of the firefighters themselves involved in this.

Speaker 18 00:28:59.540
All right. I think we saw that in the 60s. But when they had the blackout last time I wasn't actually working but I did go down to Broadway where there was quite a bit of looting going on.

Speaker 26 00:29:15.470
And the firefighters there I mean white firefighters were by themselves unattended. There were no problems at all. OK.

Speaker 29 00:29:23.060
That's really good to hear a guest on tonight sole reason has been Robert Turner who is president of the Vulcan society's society of black firefighters interested in getting more minorities involved in the examination which has its filing date on October 25th. Anyone interested in this examinations is call 2 3 3 5 8 2 0 0. That's a firefighter's recruiting unit. This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for solar reason this program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with W NBC.
