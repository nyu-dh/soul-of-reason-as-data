Each summer some 500 Black and Puerto Rican youth in East Harlem and Harlem are served by a major alternative education program called Broad Jump. Hear what Broad Jump is about on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:40.321
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:01:07.050
Our guest this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Ron Batchelor who is Executive Director of Broad Jump, which is a major alternative education program which operates in Harlem and East Harlem. Glad to have you with us this evening, Ron.

Rob Batchelor 00:01:20.611
I'm glad to be here, Dr. Brown.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:01:22.591
Now, Broad Jump sounds very exciting. For one thing, the name itself is exciting.

Rob Batchelor 00:01:26.521
It is exciting.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:01:27.341
The concept is exciting. So, first of all, could you tell us what the name means, and then tell us about the concept, and how you carry this concept out.

Rob Batchelor 00:01:35.551
Broad Jump, it's not a sports activity, and our name Broad Jump means that we want our youngsters to make a broad jump in their intellectual and self development. So the term Broad Jump is meant to mean youngsters we want you to grow and make big leaps into learning. And that's how we got our name.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:01:55.720
I notice you say big leaps into learning, and the major focus of the program is the development of academic skills and increased self-awareness, and development of the potential of young people in all areas. And you operate, as you suggest, mainly in Harlem and East Harlem; yet, by coincidence your office is 55 Fifth Avenue which is right around the corner from the New School of Social Research in Greenwich Village. Why is that? Just to get us started.

Rob Batchelor 00:02:24.480
Well there are, two learning, there are seven learning centers, in Broad Jump. 55 Fifth Avenue is the administrative learning center ,where we work, where we fund raise where we train teachers, where youngsters come to see us. However we have seven different schools throughout Manhattan where the youngsters come for a six week summer program and a year round follow up. So that, while I may be located at 55 Fifth Avenue, that's where we administratively handle the needs of the Broad Jump experience. But actually the learning environments take place in public and private schools during the summer and during the school year throughout the year. So that 55 Fifth Avenue is just one of the seven addresses of the Broad Jump experience.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:03:08.550
Where are some of the other schools located at? We focused on Harlem and East Harlem, but I believe a couple are in some other parts of the city. Where are they located?

Rob Batchelor 00:03:15.464
Right. We have a Broad Jump program at P.S. 57, which is located 115th Street and Lexington. And that program is for our youngsters who are in the second and third grade. We have a bunch of experience at Teachers College, Columbia University, for seven weeks during the summer, where youngsters who are in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade, in a coeducational experience, work together with a team of 15 teachers. And these 15 teachers work with a classroom ratio of one teacher for every 10 youngsters. And at this center we help our young people make wise decisions in terms of whether I should take the academic curriculum, or should I take the vocational curriculum, or should I go into be an artist, or should I take that big step and become an actor, or set design as opposed to a traditional role function. So that the Broad Jump program has many houses. As I mentioned, at P.S. 57, at Columbia University, The Day School, the Trinity School, are to name some of the few centers where Broad Jump youngsters learn.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:04:20.649.9999999999709
Now how does a youngster get into Broad Jump? Because you've mentioned that it is an alternative education program, and that certainly means something. But what is an alternative education program? Does that mean these youngsters don't go to the regular public school [crosstalk], or does it mean that this is a supplement to the regular public schools?

Rob Batchelor 00:04:38.820
Exactly. We are a supplement to the child's public school experience. We do not replace the public school experience. What we try to do, we want our young people to become more successful learners within the public school system, and we do that by, excuse me, offering them a seven week summer school program from 9 to 4, and a year-round follow up. We are an alternative because we use different ways of trying to motivate our young Black and Puerto Rican brothers.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:05:07.411
[crosstalk] What are some of those different ways?

Rob Batchelor 00:05:10.230
One belief that I share very strongly is that young Black and Puerto Rican youngsters cannot grow, not unless they feel good about themselves as Black and Puerto Rican people. And in order to begin at that base we try to provide our youngsters with a set of experiences with competent teachers. And I emphasize competent teachers because I believe a competent teacher is a rarity in educating the lives of our young black and Puerto Rican brothers. So that I have a staff of competent teachers who spread out a series of experiences where our young people go through different plays, different musicals, and actually have sessions about their lives: who they are; how do they feel if they hear their parents fight; what do they do when they get an eviction notice from their apartment; how did they feel when they wake up and see the sun and they cannot go into the park and play because the closest thing to them are rocks and glass and a dilapidated school. What we tried to do is to get our young people to look at themselves, and their lives, so that they can feel their self, understand their self, look at their immediate community, and -- hopefully -- at the end of the Board Jump experience, be able to relate to themselves, their immediate community, and our larger society -- which is a big task.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:06:29.620
That certainly is [laughing]. If you are successful with all of that, you will have been successful at something. And very, very few people have been successful. And in a sense you are successful, and we're going to ask about some of the criteria for success. But you deal with approximately 500 youngsters which means, that's just as very, very small [crosstalk] number out of literally tens of thousands of youngsters who live [crosstalk], and go to school in Manhattan, the borough of Manhattan. How do youngsters get into the program? Are they selected by the schools? Are they selected by you?

Rob Batchelor 00:07:01.931
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:07:02.713
Do you take the youngsters who tend to show greatest promise? Or do you take any youngster who has a problem? How do you really make that decision? Because given the fact that you have limited resources, and certainly a very large set of objectives, you're not going to be able to save every youngster who wants to come to you. So how do you make the decision as to who gets into Broad Jump?

Rob Batchelor 00:07:23.501
Most of our young people, Dr. Brown, are youngsters who are under the normal range quote "what normal is" of intellectual ability, but who have not been progressing up to that ability. And that still includes some thousands of youngsters. So that the guidance counselors of various public schools, in Harlem and East Harlem, nominate each spring, youngsters to participate in our program. At that time, we go through their records, and the recommendations, and sit and meet with each parent and each child. Because participation in Broad Jump is self-initiated. The youngsters want to be in a Board Jump experience. Their parents want them to be in a Board Jump experience, and the parents are required to participate in the Broad Jump experience. So that -- while the youngsters are learning various things about themselves, their quantitative abilities, and their reading skills, and this knowledge about themselves -- we have classes where our parents participate and learn how to fill out certain intricate business forms in terms of employment personnel. We go over some of our new math strategies with our young people. So that the work that we do in the summer can be sustained and reinforced when they return at home.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:08:35.830.0000000000582
Am I correct in that the real core of the Broad Jump program is seven weeks during the summer?

Rob Batchelor 00:08:42.520.9999999999418
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:08:43.121
And then, during the regular school year, you have some supportive activities. [crosstalk] I can see the programs going on in these six or seven schools during the summer. Now they probably go on all day is that correct?

Rob Batchelor 00:08:56.700
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:08:57.132
What is the time span?

Rob Batchelor 00:08:57.752
We work from 9 o'clock to 4 o'clock in the summer for seven consecutive weeks. And we work with the youngsters in two different forms during the school year. At P.S. 57, we meet with our young people, our Broad Jump people, after school from 4, from 3 o'clock to 4:30, and on alternate Saturdays. The rest of the programs meet every Saturday for a full day, and at that time the youngsters articulate some of their experiences during the week with our staff people: what they're having a problem with at home. Trips are taken. And our greatest effort that we did, this year, was to get the entire Board Jump community together, and produce, and give to the New York community, a program called "At Home in the Sun."

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:09:40.891
And what is "At home in the Sun"?

Rob Batchelor 00:09:42.281
Well, "At home in the Sun" is a play that I conceived and directed, and a friend of mine named Nate Moore did some special writing for. This program's main objective was to get a community of people together. There are parents, counselors, administrators, teachers, young people of the entire Broad Jump community, who got together -- who had never performed before and did a production called "At home in the Sun." And this production merely said that we are creative people, but one of the strongest forces that exists in our society is the beauty and the force of the home. And while the federal government, or the state government, and the city government, will not take care of our homes, we have to be the main source of strength for our child's growth and for our individual growth at home. And we had over 1000 people at Wollman Auditorium last Thursday to see our production of "At Home in the Sun." And the second beauty of production is that kids got a chance to work with adults -- some of their teachers administrators. Because too often our youngsters are said, "I want you to do a show and I'm going to direct you." But this time we all got together and had a community effort which was, I think, an incredible response.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:10:57.340
Yes I see the program here and [crosstalk] we see these names -- literally dozens of young people's names.

Rob Batchelor 00:11:05.560
[crosstalk] We had a cast of 72 people, and it was a good production. In addition to our total Board Jump community participation in the production, we had special guests like Alberto Bradford who starred in "I Can't Cope," and Roger Darby who was in "A Hand is on the Gate," and Joyce Griffith who starred in "A Part of your System." So that our young people got close to people who believe in them: a lot of stars, a lot of administrators. And I think this is very important for the self development of young Black and Puerto Rican brothers and sisters, is to see positive adults who believe in them, and who is willing to work with them toward their growth.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:11:43.111
What you say is certainly true and I think anyone who sees some of these youngsters performing in activities like this knows about it. On the other hand one of the real crises in our schools is the fact that significant numbers of youngsters are not able to read to the level which will enable them to function in society, to function in school, or to work in the area of arithmetic [coughing], or some of the other academic areas. And I believe one of the main objectives of Broad Jump, in addition to developing and enhancing self-awareness and self-image and self-esteem, is to improve these academic skills.

Rob Batchelor 00:12:21.191
I agree.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:12:21.571
This is a very, very difficult task. Could you tell us exactly what you are doing in that area, and possibly cite some figures and statistics, [crosstalk] indicating the extent to which you've been effective in working with this aspect of young people's behavior?

Rob Batchelor 00:12:35.470
Well, I believe at Broad Jump we do a tremendous job in affective learning and affective learning meaning the attitude of your development. But in terms of cognition, we succeed also. In fact, I believe that traditionally Black and Puerto Rican youngsters have been told that they were not capable of making growth in mathematics and working with numbers. We have proved that as incorrect. According to our recent evaluation, by Dr. Fox Associates, that 66 percent of all our young people who participate in a Broad Jump experience grow in terms of one year or more in their mathematical ability. Which I think is really incredible, because my focus as an educator, and as a former teacher, was reading, and verbal responses, and cultural development. And while we did have an excellent math consultant and math development with our teachers, we were never so surprised that our young people would soar so highly on the mathematics evaluation that we provided them. And this was shown, because we did a pre-test on all our youngsters in June, and at conclusion of our program we gave another test to assess their growth during that six week period. And also, during December we gave them additional tests to see how they were growing. So the while young people have been testing a lot, we have received a lot of information which gives us added strength and insight into the nature of the curriculum that is necessary to help our young people grow in their quantitative.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:14:13.120
I think you've presented some very clear evidence that certain things can happen and I think most people recognize that practically everyone can learn. The problem is that in a complicated society not everybody gets a chance to do so. And yours is a alternative, you might even add, supplemental educational program, which means that you're spending money above and beyond what the society is spending through the regular school budgets in order to help these young people. And your organization budget, I believe, is somewhere in the magnitude of 200-and-some-odd-thousand dollars. Is that correct?

Rob Batchelor 00:14:48.190
That is correct.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:14:48.910
In order to do this type of work, and you've been successful in getting funding from a variety of sources including many of the private foundations -- and a very prestigious private foundation -- and also from some of the governmental sources. What are the potentials for funding this year? We know that government funding is down. We know that many corporations have had tough times with the recession. We know that the endowments of some of the foundations have been cut because they too invested in the stock market and stock market is down. What are your projections? How is your funding holding up? Because you certainly are doing a worthwhile job. It's a question of can you get the resources to do it?

Rob Batchelor 00:15:33.400
Yes there are a lot of government funds that, each year, go untapped because of the lack of knowledge of a lot of community groups whose efforts are to help the growth of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters. I have been able, and blessed, with a good trustee board, and my own self-initiative, to find out what monies are available that we could be eligible to receive. This year, our corporate allocations have grown. Foundations have gone down. We will receive a government grant -- hopefully, hopefully -- from Title 70, the Emergency School Aid Act. Last year, we received one hundred and fifty two thousand dollars, and we were one of the few programs to receive such a grant last year. And this year, we also in the running for a subsequent grant of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:16:25.890
And speaking of trustees: that's what helps to make an organization go. As I look at your list of trustees, you have trustees from a variety of sources. John Baker who's an Associate Professor at Yale Law School; you have Mickey Grant who's a well-known actor, actress and playwright who wrote "Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope;" you have Dave Hepburn, Vice President of Community Affairs at WNEW; you have people like Dorothy Orr who is the Assistant Commissioner of State Division of Human Rights; Carmel Carden from the Veterans Office of the Mayor; Byron Wein who's from a Wall Street firm. A whole range of people. In addition, you have educational consultants including Anthony Alvarado, the Community School District Superintendent of District 4; Daisy Hicks out of the Board of Education; Ida Lewis from "Essence Magazine" or Toni Cade who is a well known writer; etc., etc. I didn't mention everyone's name. Now with that type of board, you certainly have a lot of support. But there are many, many organizations in the community that are -- at least supposedly -- trying to do some of the same things that Broad jump is doing.

Rob Batchelor 00:17:36.411
That's very true.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:17:37.751
Apparently, on the basis of your track record, Broad jump is successful. Your per capita cost, it's reasonably high, but isn't that unreasonably high. So the question that I'm going to ask you now is Why do you think that Broad Jump has been able to attract the type of support that it has attracted? And why do you think that it has been successful while some other activities, along these lines, haven't been quite a success?

Rob Batchelor 00:18:12.920
Initially, when Broad Jump was started, a group of businessmen from the Wall Street area believed that young people in East Harlem were not achieved enough for their potential. And that was also doing the time Brother Martin Luther King, the late Martin Luther King, was assassinated, and the campuses were in uproar. So, literally, thousands of dollars were pulled into programs like Broad Jump. And, in fact, in 1969 Broad Jump had a budget operating budget of over a half a million dollars.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:18:42.331
So now you are down to about half of that.

Rob Batchelor 00:18:43.761
Now we're down to half of that because, it's just, we aren't as opportune a topic as you were in 1968.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:18:50.751
In other words, Black people aren't as "in" as much as they were in '68.

Rob Batchelor 00:18:53.391
Right, according to the eyes of larger society. So that, I had to -- when I became Executive Director of Board Jump -- literally fight to get public support and belief in the Broad Jump experience. Because in 1969, 90 percent of the Broad Jump experience was funded through foundations. Now, most of our monies are public monies. So that, now we are more tuned into the parts of the government and the community. And that's why I believe Broad Jump has lasted that long -- because of my efforts and because of a supportive community of people who believe in the Broad Jump Experience. Unfortunately, we as a people, have not been given the opportunity to give our leadership to where I believe we can, in terms of educational leadership. And too often this society has not reinforced positive, strong Black leadership. Too often they have provided white images. And I'm for our young people, in terms of leadership. And our youngsters did not see strong Black people, Black men and women fighting on their behalf. What I have in my community, and my staff have, through our efforts we have gotten our parents excited about the Broad Jump experience. So that, I could get a meeting of 400 parents at one call because they believe in what we do. And I think that's very important.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:20:17.350
Now ,how would you translate this experience to the public schools? This really is the $64,000 question, because alternative education has, as one of its main roles, the role of demonstration, the role of being a catalyst, the role of saying look here's a problem something can be done about the problem and here's the way we think it can be done. And as I said your accomplishments are certainly notable. Yesterday [crosstalk]. A per capita cost. What is it? What is your per capita cost?

Rob Batchelor 00:20:47.213
Oh, about four dollar or something [crosstalk].

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:20:51.201
Now, the per capita cost for education in New York City, generally is...

Rob Batchelor 00:20:55.462
What I would say it's like youngsters I would say about a thousand...

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:21:01.081
It's up at a thousand twelve hundred dollars. So, therefore, what you're really doing is adding about another third to the amount of money that's being spent. And you certainly are being successful. And I believe is also true that you have a population that's been selected for you, but I don't know whether there have been selected because they have problems or because they have potential.

Rob Batchelor 00:21:23.172
They have both.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:21:24.951
Well given that, having summarized your experience, what it cost and what you've don, what are some of the generalizations that you might want to offer in terms of what this means, what this can mean, to the public schools?

Rob Batchelor 00:21:44.580
I made a presentation to District Four yesterday, and that was the Advisory Committee for District 4, and I articulated to the Advisory Board our accomplishments, and the Broad Jump experience, and they are very pleased with the Broad Jump Program. One problem with the school board is that they're unable to, in terms of money, to embrace new ideas, and exciting programs, and incorporate them into their experience. Too often people at the Board of Education tend to like to see things the way they have been for a long time. And I don't want to be negative. I want to focus on the real issue: is that let Broad Jump continue to do what it's doing very good, and we hope you get money, but we want to work to survive to make our programs even better. And too often, we as a people -- all people I'm speaking of in general -- do not want to learn, and to interact, and to support one another's growth. And I think that's one negative aspect, because I still don't believe that enough people believe that our young people can learn. [crosstalk] And so they internalize the fact that our young people can learn. All the math and the literature about Broad Jump, in the world, will not change a lot of those minds. And I think that's very sad.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:22:58.021
I think that it is too. And I do think that Broad Jump ,and other programs which we haven't mentioned here, have shown -- throughout the country in specific instances -- that Black and Hispanic youth can learn. I don't think there's really any serious doubt about that. The real question is, how do we deliver the wherewithal in order to help these young people who might come from different lifestyles, might have different type of problems, to learn? And your answer to my question was what I call the add-on theory. We keep spending the money way we are doing it, and we'll spend more money and we'll get there. [crosstalk] Despite the research...

Rob Batchelor 00:23:33.840
Yeah, you know, too often people do not want to spend millions of dollars into understanding assessing the effect of positive self-esteem in Black and Puerto Rican youngsters. That's a waste of money. You know our country will spend ten million dollars to eliminate graffiti rather than spend 10 million dollars to try to understand why this response is being made, or how can we cultivate this response into our community.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:23:58.650
But you're still dealing with the add-on theory. [crosstalk] The question that I'm trying to lead you into is: what are some of the things you have learned about teaching in your organization [crosstalk] which could be used right today in the existing structure? We're spending the same amount of money. See, the add on theory assumes you keep doing the same thing and add on, and I'm raising the question: are there some other things that you've learned that might really be done within the context of the money we now have?

Rob Batchelor 00:24:27.301
I have learned -- One: that our young people learn when there are people who are in front of them who believe that they can learn. Two: these things, I don't think are new or innovative or revolutionary to. The young people learn when they are provided with curriculums that will reinforce their understanding of themselves as a people and how these curriculums will help them in this society that is very hostile. I think, Three: I have learned that, in order for young people to learn, in terms of mathematical growth, I'm speaking in terms of empirical evidence that I have seen, that our young people have to be taken from where they are in terms of their mathematic growth. For example... Do I have time? Sure. We did a comparative price shopping experiment last summer. And most our young people told us they could not do percentage. That they were incapable of percentage. And that it was something very new to them. Yet, when I saw them play games of basketball, I saw them computing the averages and percentage in how many shots. I said, listen, this is percentage. So what we did we tried to let our young people believe they have the immediate skills already. Man, the terminology confuses our young people a lot. Some of the approaches, and styles, the didactic styles, of teachers confuse our young people a lot. Some of the uses of material confuse them, but I believe that starting from where they are and building on their strengths, and their knowledge, to carry them further. I don't believe in reintroducing new knowledge to youngsters thinking that they will grab something that they have no foundation for.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:26:04.220
Of course you've said something, and a number of people education have said, and you admitted it yourself: the thing that was coming across my mind, as you were talking, particularly the society, of believing that Black and Hispanic youth can learn. How do you instill belief in teachers?

Rob Batchelor 00:26:19.200
That's very hard. And I believe that's something that we could spend perhaps a weekend talking about because teachers have existed in a society that has given them information that Black and Puerto Rican people cannot learn. And somehow the schools of learning that we have gone to, and I went to Penn State University and Harvard University, and I've gone through the whole mechanism of what they consider a good education, and I can see from my experiences that this society reinforces that superiority of the white intellect. And that's a big problem that we're dealing with.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:26:55.680
But of course success images like Broad Jump ,and what these young people do, and what you yourself do as a role model, tend to turn this around.

Rob Batchelor 00:27:04.292
It does.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:27:04.891
So you're going to have some progress there. [crosstalk] The other part of the problem is how do you get schools to do new things?

Rob Batchelor 00:27:13.521
You get schools to do new things when they're ready to receive them. And a lot of school systems are mainly ready to... Teachers' federations are ready to keep all the teachers employed. I think there's so many adult interest groups in the school now that we have forgotten about our young people. And I think I'm disillusioned with that.

Dr. Roscoe Brown 00:27:34.180
I don't think you're really disillusioned because you are out there working with [crosstalk] an organization like Broad Jump. I'd like to mention to our audience that if anyone wants to get further information about Broad Jump ,they can contact Broad Jump at 55 Fifth Avenue in New York City, or else call 255-5570. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Ron Batchelor, who is Executive Director of Broad Jump -- which is an outstanding program helping Black and Hispanic youth in Harlem and East Harlem to develop the type of academic skills, and to enhance their self-image, and to move ahead, and accomplish something in the world about them. Thanks for being [crosstalk].

Rob Batchelor 00:28:11.320
Thank you so very much. It was a pleasure.
