Speaker 1 00:00:02.000
Recently the Guardians Association of the police department of the city of New York the black policemen's organization in New York City endorsed implementation of a resolution to terminate affiliation with the PBA the Police Benevolent Association. Here Willie Ward president and Howard Chaffee past president and chairman of the board discussed this important issue on tonight's soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:45.250
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:12.310
With us this evening on soul of reason Willie Ward who is president of the Guardians Association of the police department of the city of New York and Howard Schaeffer who is past president and chairman of the board. And we'll be talking about issues related to black policemen in the city of New York their affiliations with the Police Benevolent Association and the way in which criminal justice and law enforcement is applied in the black community. Glad to have you gentlemen with us tonight. Thank you sir. All right. Willie could you begin by more or less reviewing for our audience the position of the Guardians Association on affiliation with the Police Benevolent Association which is the audience knows is the official bargaining agent for the police department.

Speaker 4 00:01:59.140
And in fact has been the so-called line police organization would you begin by talking about your position then we'll ask how would something about the background of well at the moment our position is kind of questionable as you noted in the past month or so the mandate voted the organization voted a mandate to the leadership of the guardians that we explore the feasibility of withdrawing the organization from the ranks of the PBA and a possible to set up our own program to institute programs and policies for the betterment of our membership. And at present we have set up various committees to research the various needs of the individual members and hopefully to set these things into practice in the very near future. But just to give a little perspective how many members does the PBA have and how many members of the Guardian association have. I think as far as numbers of the PBA we should they should be in the neighborhood of twenty six thousand. And of that number there are proximate Lee Nineteen Hundred Guardian members. Or to say black police personnel. And of that seventeen hundred would be in the policeman rank order police officer ranks.

Speaker 5 00:03:49.640
I see now Howard in terms of the background of this particular decision on the membership. Is this based on a lack of satisfaction with the negotiations with the city over salary and assignment measures. Or does it come out of some issue that relates to conflict between black community the black community and the police department or between black police officers and white police officers over a particular issue. What is the genesis of this concern between the PBA and the guardians.

Speaker 6 00:04:28.670
Well sadly the the the the conflict between the Guardians and the PBA is one of the Guardians having been excluded from participation in the PBA by the guard and you really mean black blacks ICE officers. I mean it's the police department 23 years. And at no point in that twenty three years have we ever had more than four black delegates in the PBA. We have never had anyone in any office other than that of God of of delegating the constitutional mandate in the PBA for Ascension within the organization specified that one must be a delegate in order to aspire or climb to other office which for all intents and purposes precludes our participation. The reaction by the leadership of the PBA historically and even right now has been one of you can make it just like I did the other democratic process the democratic process is the only way that you can participate in the policymaking of the PBA. And throughout my tenure and affiliation as administrator of the Guardians through four administrations of the PBA the response to our complaints about this affiliation by them has been that the door is always open. We can always come up and talk about problems that affect us. The truth of the matter is is that the door may be open but has not been open to us for any kind of constructive results of those meetings. The meetings that we have had have been you know nice good fulfilling meetings as far as esoteric conversation but never any any constructive result going into this business of the delegates.

Speaker 5 00:06:23.660
I gather the delegates are elected from their precinct or from their unit. They are not all they elected citywide.

Speaker 7 00:06:31.250
They are elected by their command so to speak. Their assignment.

Speaker 6 00:06:36.170
The assignment of record in each precinct and I'll use precinct as an example in each precinct there are usually three delegates and each one of is up for re-election every third year which means that every February one third of a delegate body is up for re-election. Total delegate body is how many one hundred three hundred and sixty five and that includes all other offices because you have to you are always basically a delegate like the Marine Corps. You're always a rifleman.

Speaker 8 00:07:05.300
So this suggests then that in history they've only been for black delegates.

Speaker 9 00:07:09.570
No no I said I've only been a maximum of four at any one time one percent actually they have only been seven black delegates in my history in the police department. Never more than four at one time.

Speaker 5 00:07:24.080
Now do you feel that this is because of a definite attempt to discriminate or do you feel it because people vote along ethnic lines and since there is a minority of black officers then a majority population just sort of takes over and wins every time.

Speaker 10 00:07:39.020
Well this is basically true by the mere fact of our numbers. And you know the desires of the city so the membership has been allotted you know 2 or 3 in each specific area. So that of course precludes day a nomination or election to these polls. Now it's true that I believe in at one time some years back we did have one of our delegates was running for one of the positions on the executive slate. But if my memory serves me that that whole slate they just didn't stand a chance.

Speaker 5 00:08:21.100
Now recently I believe there was some conflict with black police officers in general and the PBA with regard to the quick release of a white police officer who killed a black youth in a housing project I believe in Brooklyn and the PBA put up money for his legal defense. And I do recall hearing in the press that the guardians in particular but black police officers in general were very upset about this. Now is this the type of issue you're saying that they you feel that the PBA does not adequately represent the concerns of black officers or even the black community.

Speaker 11 00:09:02.430
And there were several things that went along with that shooting. We were not like the listening public to think it was just a shooting and the things around that that caused us to get in an uproar. In June of last year our newsletter carried a full page analysis called seven hundred thirty thousand dollars to who for what and why. And it was to us a critical analysis of the amount of money that we fed into the PBA be a dues and health with health and welfare funds custodianship. And in our analysis we could find no program that was espoused by the PBA that had any black perspective in its background. We could find no legislative program such as did lobbyists dare to work on that acted in the interests of New Yorkers of visa v. the black New Yorkers most of their legislative programs were counter to the best interests of black men. You give an example of one of those programs they can't fight against a residency Bill. The New York City Police Department say is that approximate thirty five percent of the police department lives outside the city. They don't talk about the percentage of New York City Police Department who lives without the state. They don't give the true facts about the people who do live outside the city. The I believe and a lot of the Guardian members believe that you bring a little bit more into the job. If you have a personal interest in what's going on in your neighborhood in the surrounding neighborhoods. I have a very difficult time believing that an officer is really concentrate on his job when he's more concerned about his law and brining out out in suburbia wherever he is.

Speaker 5 00:10:48.730
Maybe you don't know this but I'm tempted to ask what proportion of the Guardian members live outside of the city because one of the problems we've had in the black community is that as blacks become more affluent they follow the trek to the suburbs as well and in other programs I've asked a similar kind of questions of various organizations and their response has been there's not so much where I live in the city but whether I identify with black people similarly white police officers could say it's not so much whether I live in the city but whether I identify with it that residency issue is a is a hot one.

Speaker 8 00:11:24.040
I recognize as significant political connotations and I just as a matter of interest maybe you know you don't know what proportion of your members you think live in the city out of the city.

Speaker 7 00:11:35.980
Well I've got to say that I know they explore that. My estimate based on and Willie served at one time is our corresponding secretary so he knows better than I probably. My estimate is like about 5 percent of the Guardian's live outside of city. But like your previous participants in this program of saying the working hierarchy of the Guardians The Working hierarchy of the Federation of Negro Civil Service Organization and practically every viable community interest organization in the black community most of the people in those organizations really work live out in the hinterlands in suburbia. It's something unique about being black. Other than our color and then most of us don't forget our basic ties. And you know I would not even like to talk about identifying black and some of our predecessors. The fact is is that in the guardians we have a saying that says if it's good for the Guardian it's good for the city. And I don't think we've ever been on a quest for anything for our membership that would not ultimately be beneficial way for the department at large. And I think that goes throughout the spectrum of the things that we're trying to do with black community interest organizations in that the what we're looking for is beneficial to the city at large.

Speaker 12 00:12:55.720
Of course some of the representatives of PBA who obviously are not here tonight I might say the same thing that they are interested in protecting the city. One of the things that has happened most recently is that in these negotiations between the city and the PBA and various contractual situations they have gone to court and they basically have won in terms of retroactive pay and things of this type. Some people say that's not good for the city. On the other hand some other people who are equally determined to see the city survive as the city citizens live up to its contracts. And if that's what occurred that's the way it is now. Well if in fact this this affiliation goes through who will represent the black police officer in the negotiations with the city. Because I believe the arrangements are that the line organization and PBA is the legal collective bargaining representative. Now if blacks pull out of they'll en masse what input at all will they be for the black police officer in the negotiations with the city.

Speaker 10 00:14:04.660
Well I believe when we get to that point and so to speak if we forced the PBS hand if they intend to negotiate for the police department for the public police officer in the police department I don't think there is no way in any clear conscience that they could go into any type of negotiations without first consulting us as a group and hopefully that this day will come when then when this will come to pass. But as it stands now they're just disregarding our membership as a state and we're not even we don't even exist. And we keep that keep the pressure up and we and we we hit them where it hurts. And if we remove seven hundred seventeen hundred members at this time I believe it'll hurt and they'll start noticing that that we actually there and any future negotiations and we're talking this evening with Willie Ward who's president of the Guardians Association of the police department the city of New York and Howard Chaffee who's past president and chairman of the board.

Speaker 13 00:15:09.760
Now Howard as we were saying the possible removal of the black police officers from the PBA would in my opinion quite possibly lessening the bargaining position of even the PBA. Now how does your association see that.

Speaker 9 00:15:25.120
Well could we just go back to your previous question just the way you worded that question is the cause for our concern. You mentioned the arrangement in which the PBA is the officials collective bargaining agent. We submit that it is indeed an arrangement that even though we're told that it is the Labor bargaining law the city labor law that decides who is going to be the official collective bargaining agent that it is a law for convenience convenience. Maybe the city government and or for the collective bargaining agent we've been told by counsel that representing approximately 10 percent of the PBA membership that there is a means in which we can get what we call in Labor circles standing and then not standing it would authorize us to represent ourselves. We understand that we're talking about seventeen hundred members pulling from the PBA carrying with them one hundred and fifty dollars a year dues carrying with them approximately six hundred and fifty dollars in health and welfare benefits. I think that if one follows the other and that if we pull out from the PBA we're going to do everything we can to pull those resources with us. The other thing is is that there are certain benefits that a member is alleged to get from membership in the PBA. We are as we mentioned early on. We have task force assigned and committees searching out comparable benefits that has been given by the PBA. And even benefits that would exceed that including legal representation in personal and private matters the president of the PBA has of time said since the controversy came up that the door is always open as I mentioned before. Now a classic example is that Willie has been in office now since the third the fourth of January. And one would have thought that with the new administration coming into the guardians that the least the present PBA and or some of his board members would have done was to reach out to Willie to see if there was a different perspective with the new administration if there was an area in which the two organization could compromise the difference.

Speaker 13 00:17:37.930
And indeed if it was any other way that we could approach the problem rather than through division ism I say now you've talked about in the sense the politics of the relationship between PBA and the audience. What are some of the other issues other than the residency requirement that the PBA is taking positions on that you think might be and a medical to either back police officers or to the black community.

Speaker 14 00:18:05.020
You mentioned the bail situation with the shooting on Thanksgiving Day. Our issue is not so much with the PBA giving bail if indeed that's going to be a universal policy for all the membership. But the fact is is that the PBA has established a precedent in that the only two occasions that I know that they have gone bail for one of the members has been in the immediate aftermath of the shooting to death of a black youth. There was one incident in Queens involving Clifford Glover and the other incident. Now with Randolph Evans. Now it's not the amount of money involved because the bond fee for forty thousand dollars is only about four hundred dollars. The statements that were attributed to have never been denied by the president of the PBA. Immediately after the shooting indicates to us that there as a growth feeling of lack of esteem for this black members a lack of consideration for the sensibilities of black members and the black community when statements are made immediately after a shooting like this that the officer did what he had to do because he was in danger or this is what you can expect in this kind of a neighborhood. It tells me that if this man is supposed to be symbolic of the of its leadership and his constituency that he is speaking out in the terms and in the in the manifestation of the entire membership. And this is totally against all concepts of the Guardians Association.

Speaker 13 00:19:38.110
Willie in that regard what have the Guardians done or what is the Guardians Association doing to improve relations between the police department and the black community. Obviously something like the Evans shooting certainly creates a sense of hostility and concern for the audience's recollection of this shooting that occurred on Thanksgiving Day where allegedly a police officer who happened to be white shot a black youth for no ostensible reason. And right now I think the matter is still being investigated. Is there any new information on that in terms of why it happened.

Speaker 10 00:20:18.340
No not at this time I think it's in the hands of the Brooklyn district attorney so that nobody is talking about it.

Speaker 13 00:20:27.460
But initially when the incident occurred it appeared that the you know there's something emotional involved and why they often may have done it. But in the meantime I know that it did create a lot of hostility and anger in the black community for an apparently unprovoked shooting of a black youth by a white officer. And my own opinion is if the shooting had been unprovoked by a black officer it would have also contributed a certain amount of consternation possibly not as much but what are the guardians doing to improve relations between the police department and the black community.

Speaker 15 00:21:04.390
Well the Guardians are doing now what they have in the past they have always addressed themselves to any type of problem that was unhealthy to the black community. The Guardians I believe stand on their record that they addressed themselves to the problem of blacks that being arrested were brutalized in police stations and as guardian members individually or as an organ of a organization. They almost see to it that this type of practice does not continue just by their mere presence and occasionally sometimes they have to you know exert themselves a little physically to make sure that this practice is not continued. And I think we've more or less become a conscience for for the police department to put our cell phone records and the Guardian's right now are very concerned about the treatment of witnesses say the whole criminal justice structure seems to be geared towards the criminal.

Speaker 8 00:22:16.570
He gets protected he gets lawyers he gets more or less coddle but the poor victim just completely forgotten forgotten about because you you just sort of developed a little inconsistency on one hand your earlier statement was that you want to be sure that the prisoner doesn't get roughed up beaten up and on the other hand you say that the society is more concerned or that the system is more concerned with the criminal and the victim and one of the allegations. I happen not to believe in beating up prisoners but one of the allegations is if somebody is really messed up with someone they deserve to be treated a little hostility.

Speaker 15 00:22:51.310
And while this might be true it did at the time of the original confrontation but we are talking about maybe an hour later or maybe a day later you know what I'm saying. Did two things go hand in hand. I mean there is a problem in both instances and we just can't turn our back on either one of them.

Speaker 16 00:23:13.100
I had something definitely right about that. The what he is saying and I'm really in accord with him is that we go to the presumption of innocence with someone who is arrested is according to our Constitution presumed innocent. He may be shooting at you at the time. Well I mean that still does not warrant a police officer exacting punishment. So we have courts. No I wouldn't care about that. But you see quite often the role or the image of a police officer is that of the Avenging Angel and the Guardians have never espoused that particular kind of an image. We we believe that it is our job to protect people first to prevent crimes from happening to them and every arrest that we make is a confession of our faith. But however in confessing that we fail at arresting a perpetrator it's still not within our right or our responsibility to exert punishment. The other thing that he was talking about is that even though statistics point out that most crimes are committed by minorities specifically black they neglect somehow to publicize the fact that most of those crimes are perpetrated against other blacks. The sum of the crimes that are committed in the black community are crimes of retribution crimes of reprisal for something that's been done because the people have lost their confidence in the police department or the police departments lost his credibility with the people. So now what we're trying to say is that if we can find a way to keep people from having to come to court time and time again unnecessarily to keep people from being intimidated because they come forth as witnesses to have somebody there to represent their interests or they don't know what's going on inside the court the courtroom. And we just talked about it on Friday and we were reminded of cases where people have sat in a courtroom all day in a case that they were concerned about was heard and and adjourned to another date early in the morning and they were sitting there and anyone know it. These are the kinds of things we're talking about and I think they kind of go hand-in-hand.

Speaker 13 00:25:21.180
Well of course you're talking about kind of a general breakdown in the criminal justice system. One of the problems that we face right here in New York City is that the number of crimes particularly crimes of property and also crimes of property and assault have increased so much because of the terrible economic conditions of the city.

Speaker 16 00:25:42.150
Could I come in here break breakdown. Strange enough the breakdowns always manifest themselves in the black community strange enough that when we have situations and most recently the publicity about the Columbia University professor who was murdered on 16th Street and the crime was solved and for a day they turned upside down a whole website to find the perpetrators crimes and people are dying in Harlem every day and nobody cares. The simplest way to get away with something is for Black to go to Harlem to get rid of another black. He's almost known that he won't mean nothing will happen to them. Now this breakdown is somewhat universal and predictable. And until such time as this is rectified it's the only way that the criminal justice system will incur kind of a credibility with the people who have the only ability to rectify how could this be rectified.

Speaker 9 00:26:34.860
Well no one is to entertain the complaints in Harlem the same way they're entertained in Lower Park avenue for people to begin to feel that they are welcome in the station house and not an intruder just even started a building station houses like that places that in the public interest and not like fortresses in the middle of the desert repelling the infidels to enforce the department's rules on human relations to try to impose some very strong and predictable sanctions on police officers who violate the premises of human relations as approaching two people right now. I mean in the city of New York fairly well universal it's become all right to hate you know everybody's got their own ethnic group thing everybody wants to compete with everybody.

Speaker 7 00:27:30.290
The city management used to be you know where we placate them niggers. Now the city got me trying to placate everybody. And meantime everybody gets a little piece of the action they're finished fighting over it. There's nothing left to deal with the problems of the city.

Speaker 12 00:27:44.520
I see Willie in terms of your organization and saying but the management of the police department. What are the key problems you have with the management of the police department.

Speaker 15 00:27:55.140
Well right now we we I guess we have to get some more blacks on the on the management level of views ideas and thoughts and feelings they have to be amplified on the top. That's basically what it is.

Speaker 12 00:28:07.680
I think that's a very direct ends the fence and say you can't really be too much involved with management do you get there yourself. Basically the Guardian has a very positive approach in trying to deal with some of the problems that affect our community the black community. When will you finally make your decision and implement what you're going to do in terms of your relationship with PBA.

Speaker 15 00:28:29.730
Well we have and we don't have a target date because now we're talking about things that we have never been involved in. We're talking about moneys that none of us singly or collectively has ever had you know an opportunity to deal with. So we're hoping that you know we don't want to walk into a situation where we'll be exploited.

Speaker 12 00:28:51.630
All right that's a good point and wish to end the show tonight. Our guest have been Willie Ward who's president and Howard Chafee past president and chairman of the board of the Guardians Association of the police department of the city of New York.
