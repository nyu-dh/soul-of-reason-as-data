J. E. Franklin and Micki Grant have co-authored a new black musical "The Prodigal Sister," which opened last month at the Theatre de Lys to critical acclaim. Hear Woodie King, producer of this exciting musical, discuss the play on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:37.210
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:03.391
And with us on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Woodie King, Junior, producer, director, playwright, and man about black theater. Glad to have you with us tonight.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:01:11.411
Glad to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:12.732
Well you ought to be pretty excited. You have a new play that's opened, two great ladies involved in writing it: J. E. Franklin who wrote "Black Girl" and Micki Grant who wrote and performed in "Don't bother Me, I Can't Cope." You're at the Theater de Lys, you've gotten good reviews. And could you tell us just something about this. How has the play generally been received? What is the theme of the play? And who are some of the people who are associated with it?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:01:39.430
Okay. First thing I want to say is that Micki Grant, who has written the music for this book, and the book is written by J. E. Franklin. We also have a fantastic third lady involved, the director Shauneille Perry [crosstalk] fantastic woman, you know, who has, I mean, worked endlessly with this play from workshop inception last July, through our Philadelphia engagement, through the off Broadway engagement which we're into now, and all along the way. These, these three women have been fantastic, and I think that's why we've gotten all these fantastic reviews. I think that's why we've gotten the fantastic critical response and public response that we have. And I'm very very happy about that. But I think the main reason that the play is attracting so many people is mainly because a black musical, it's all like new. You know, it's a new form. We've been into straight plays since the black theater movement began. [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:45.201
And as you said that, I would have got to just be a little facetious and say, "yes a new form," Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake wrote "Shuffle Along" [laughing]

Woodie King, Jr. 00:02:52.452
Way back when, right, right.

00:02:54.221
I know what you mean, you mean in terms of this more recent, the new evolution [crosstalk].

Woodie King, Jr. 00:02:58.501
Right. Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:59.053
Because we've had, we've had some interesting black, well I guess another question is what's a black musical. For example we've had some musicals that have had black people in them.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:03:08.831
Right. Which are not

00:03:10.751
Well let's talk about it, that's very interesting, because you have had musicals like "Purlie" and like "Raisin," both of which were adaptations of earlier plays ("Purlie Victorious" and "A Raisin in the Sun"). We had what Melvin Van Peebles did, "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death," directed by Gil Moses, good friend of yours. So we had that kind of thing, but I gather you're talking about something else, and

Woodie King, Jr. 00:03:34.531
I, I am

Speaker 8 00:03:35.650
You're talking about the so-called typical, if there is any such thing

Woodie King, Jr. 00:03:39.281
Oh, no

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:39.284
Broadway musical.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:03:40.390
No, no, I'm not. See, you get into, get into a weird sort of situation on what is a black play, what is a black musical. And as, from a producer's point of view, when I speak of a black musical, I mean that is written by a black person, the music is by a black, I mean it is directed by a black, and is produced by a black.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:02.171
Okay

Woodie King, Jr. 00:04:02.741
Now on the other hand, when, say, a Phil Rose talks about a black musical, he, a project, project like "Purlie," he's talking about all those people that brought him the material, and now I will, I will reinterpret this as a director and producer from a white point of view, and make it acceptable to those white, that white audience that might come in to see it. You know it's really from the point of view of one's position, you know what I mean? OK. Now I can't help that, but a "Raisin," you know, I don't, in my particular case, I don't look at that as a black musical. I look at it as a musical that, you know, there's a lot of black people in it, [laughs] you know what I mean?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:47.321
Although it has been received fairly well.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:04:50.050
Oh yeah. [crosstalk] I mean, I mean the audience loves it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:52.081
Fantastic, really talented cast.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:04:54.501
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:55.001
I think it has something to do The book was fantastic that original, the original read the book. [crosstalk] And of course some people raise the question is whether "Raisin" should have been a musical, and we had Virginia Capers on the show and we talked about that particular issue. And you know there are different points of view. However Virginia has interpreted it beautifully. Some of the music is very, very strong in it. But let's talk about the book slash the music in "The Prodigal Sister." What is the theme behind this particular musical?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:05:22.630
Okay "Prodigal Sister" is loosely based on the prodigal son legend in the Bible, right? Okay. J. E. Franklin said, well why should it always be interpreted from that point of view? I mean, what if that had happened to a woman, a young woman, going into the city

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:38.601
Is this a women's liberationists view, or is this

Woodie King, Jr. 00:05:39.680
I don't think so, I think

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:41.481
another way of looking at it?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:05:42.203
Yeah, I think it's another way of looking at it. You know, I think it's, it's a little woman's lib in there. But I don't think that, that distracts from the, any kind of the beautiful, effective theatricality of the whole piece, okay. But I think she took that biblical concept and turned it into a now, hip, modern kind of book. And Micki Grant looked at it and looked for the blues in it, looked for the religion in it, looked for the so-called pop in it, and translated that and put it in a musical form. And so when the people, the lead characters and whatever sing the songs there, it's, it covers the whole spectrum of black music. That is what Micki is so fantastic at. I mean, she can pick up a song and make it reach everyone, you know I mean? But she isn't, yeah she is really a black composer.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:40.252
Who's performing in the play?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:06:42.712
Okay, we have that fantastic actor Leonard Jackson, who is the star of the film "Five on the Black Hand Side." And he is the meanest father in the world [laughing]

00:06:54.541
He's a mean dude, all right.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:06:56.111
And in this, so like pop hip version, you know, he is so mean and he, like, drives everyone away from home, you know. I also have playing his wife Frances Salisbury, a fantastic singer who was in the, who was in "Purlie." And a new young actress named Paula Desmond, who plays the prodigal sister. Louise Stubbs, I think you know her, who was in the original production of "Black Girl." I mean we've got a fantastic cast. Kirk Kirksey, who has won two or three Obie awards. All these people have been with us from the beginning. And I'm very proud that they've liked the show and stayed with it this long.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:30.650
You said one thing, "us." Are you talking about new Federal Theatre? You're talking about Woodie King? You're talking about black theater in general?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:07:38.090
Well, "us," black theater in general. You know, it's all one. There's no division between Woodie King and the New Federal Theatre. There's no division between Woodie King, New Federal Theatre, and the black theater movement, because it's all one, you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:49.681
Are you related to the Black Theater Alliance?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:07:51.821
We're a member of the Black

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:53.240
I know that, we had Joan Sandler on the air and talking about the Black Theater Festival, and one of the things that I frequently say is that black theater probably is the most exciting thing in the world of theater.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:08:04.731
Definitely. I agree with you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:05.420
It brings forth the challenges that, as I say, come from the experience of oppression.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:08:11.331
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:11.333
And it becomes a catalytic force rather than an imitative force which is

Woodie King, Jr. 00:08:15.792
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:16.551
So much of what theater is in general. Now there's another part of the product of the system which I think is interesting, and you said it's black written, black directed, and black produced, because that means black people put the money up to see how it goes. Could you tell us something about that? How did that come about? How successful has it been? What are the things that you're looking forward to, because you're at the Theater de Lys now on Christopher Street?

00:08:42.962
Right, 121 Christopher Street.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:44.480
And as a matter of fact we probably should tell the audience so they could check it out. [crosstalk] [laughter] The phone number at the theater is WA48782

Woodie King, Jr. 00:08:55.162
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:55.163
And they can call and make arrangements to bring a groups or individual.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:08:59.491
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:59.961
I think it is certainly a very, very worthwhile play.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:09:02.990
Right, and it's very appropriate for a young audience and family audience.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:05.901
That is really, really outta sight. Well let's tell us about your production.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:09:10.120
Okay, well, I think you're talking about the whole idea like black people investing [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:15.592
And so on, what it takes. And,  an example in "The Prodigal Sister," this is something that you put together with some other folks.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:09:22.350
Right, okay. What happens is, I would do a play in a workshop, I would look at it. I would get some sort of critical response from that. And I, then I would go to five or six,  five or six people who've always invested in things that I've done. Because I made them a lot of money and other shows are produced, okay. And I will go to them and say "look at this show do you think this is something you would like to get involved in?" And five or six says, "Yeah I think I would. I really want get involved and help you there." Then that means that's maybe one, one fourth of the total amount that's needed that can come from those five or six people. And then I will go round in different places, like Philadelphia where we open the play, we have a Philadelphia investment group. We, they come to the previews, they look at it, they see what they feel about it, and they can invest, you know, people investing in things, two hundred fifty dollars up to two thousand dollars, you know. There's sort of a system, you know, you know if a person is making twelve thousand dollars a year he can invest five hundred, you know, if a person is making twenty thousand, you can invest a thousand. You know, in some way if he doesn't invest it in the play he's gonna lose it, you know, some other way, tax wise, some way you will lose it, right? Okay. And, the white system is sort of like this, I found a way to deal with that. And so I just, like, adapted that system in terms of dealing with people who eventually invest in the show. Okay. And the investors that I have in this show are people who really cannot afford to lose money. You know, you got it, you say "listen, I've tested the play out. You've seen it." So the chances are highly unlikely that they will lose at the point when I go to them, you know, because I wouldn't go to them with the script. I would put the production on in a workshop have, critics come and see it, write about it so they can see the response before they put their money in, before it moves into that commercial arena. So my, the people I go to to invest, I'm fairly successful at getting them to invest because I don't lose them money. I mean, my investors get paid back first, you know, and it's like, I don't, you know, you don't see anybody else making money until they make their money back, you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:41.090
Well now you're at the Theater de Lys now. I guess it's classified as an off Broadway

Woodie King, Jr. 00:11:45.592
Off Broadway house, yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:47.510
Now, is it possible that, with the success of the play, that you might want to go to Broadway? And does that raise some other kind of problems financially?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:11:54.440
Well if we we have like six or seven rave reviews, say we're turning people away at the box office, then all the Broadway producers who all those theaters will give me anything I want to bring the show to their theater, because that means they're sitting dark now, and they're losing money. That's, you know, there are costs. I would love to move to Broadway if it's the kind of hit that I think it would be. And if I can control the situation once it moves there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:27.611
That's a very interesting point. I control the situation. You mean the artistic situation? A financial situation?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:12:34.820
No, no, I mean, for example, a show on Broadway, the rates are different. I mean when you put an ad in the paper it cost twice as much. The theater rental, the box office treasurers, box office, box office treasurers, ushers, union stagehands, and the kind of show and the kind of family unit that we pull together make this show happen. With that body of people, which is all white, you know what I mean, I will be paying more white people to work than the 14 people that are in the show acting. And I just don't want to get into that situation where I've had a white theater on 30 percent of the gross, when I'm paying union stagehands twice as much as the black performers are getting and they haven't done anything, we just take a show in the theater. A box office treasurer, treasury, who most of the time will be stealing from you. You know what I mean, two of them, who are white, who are making more than I'm making, some ushers who will make it. You know the union have set this.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:37.790
What about that, what can you do about that, because that's a very keen reality. I think the reality of anybody who goes into Broadway.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:13:44.131
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:45.161
And it has to do with going into any of the arts where we have set rates established by unions and guilds and so on. What in fact can you do about that?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:13:54.520
I try and bring out

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:55.464
Can you get, can you negotiate around some of those issues?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:13:59.370
Yeah, what you can do is, you can go into the theater, say listen we will bring the show in if you hire my, the box office treasurer, you know, at least one of them be black. If, if I see half of those stagehands on the stage black, then we got a deal. You know what I mean? If the "Times" gonna give me a special rate because the amount that black people pay to come in see a show is not the amount that white people pay. I cannot charge twelve dollars for white people, for what, for a black person to come in to see that show. And that is what the time, that is what the advertising rates are based on. Well, white people can afford to pay to come and see a show.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:35.571
This is very interesting, because, sole reason being a show about black people and black life, frequently issues come up like this that the approach that is used in the business or education or the arts, dealing with blacks is different. And the approach that's used generally dealing with whites, and some folks move to say, some white people would say, well gee why can't black people do it just the same way white people can do it?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:15:03.373
Right [laughing]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:04.130
[crosstalk] I think the answer is racism. And it does mean that if blacks are to be able to move ahead in the arts, in business, and education, at certain points of time they're going to have to be adjustments. Another interesting question, as you mentioned this twelve dollar and I know 15 and 18 dollar tops, what are we really trying to do with the arts? Are we really trying to make them available only to people who can afford to buy, pay the high prices? And I know myself sometimes you go to these top theaters and you see the front rows all empty.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:15:40.491
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:41.171
The house's scale is a sell out.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:15:43.251
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:43.581
Which means, that some folks just bought the tickets

Woodie King, Jr. 00:15:45.421
And not even going to show up

00:15:45.428
for business or for status purposes and don't really care about the art.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:15:49.980
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:50.391
Now there are, I think, various theater development funds where folks might be able to get some tickets cheaply, but still there's not enough of that. And I guess a black producer or black performers are sort of in the middle, in some instances. In order to get the kind of income from your services, which you deserve, frequently you have to move into the larger scheme of things.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:16:14.691
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:15.291
Doug Ward had this problem with "The River Niger" after moving the larger scheme of things, yet at the same time the various messages that you want to get across and the theater experience, you aren't able to do it. Now it's partially where the Theater Alliance comes in, and that they sort of coordinate and help provide publicity to a neighborhood.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:16:35.410
Right. The neighborhood, smaller theaters [unintelligible]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:37.191
There is something about being on Broadway. There is something about being off Broadway, for that matter, where you can get the recognition and literally encompass larger audiences.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:16:47.121
Right, right. See off Broadway you can control the situation from, from word go. On Broadway, Blacks we, I mean we have not moved into that arena on a strong enough scale. What Doug Ward had an opportunity to do, I thought, I thought was fantastic. He took "River Niger" to Broadway, and he kept the same ticket prices that he had off Broadway, right? And he didn't care whether it lost all the money, okay.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:15.351.0000000001164
Which it didn't.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:17:15.354
Which it didn't, right. Because it won all sorts of awards. Okay. I can't gamble with my investors money that way, you know, because I have people who cannot afford to lose it, you know. Moving to Broadway, for me, would mean, would mean the possibility of a larger audience. You know what I mean? That audience that the "New York Times" said, like, "listen, come and see the play, it's one of the greatest plays in the world," right? Then you know, it's gonna be full of the white people who usually come to

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:45.641
who have the money and read the reviews

Woodie King, Jr. 00:17:46.731
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:46.961
And want to identify

Woodie King, Jr. 00:17:48.171
But then you know on the other hand, I won't get the black people in because they can't afford to pay that price, right? So it has to be some adjustment there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:56.230
Well this raises an interesting artistic, philosophical question, that is who is theater for anyway? Is it for playwrights?  Is it for the directors?  Is it for the actors? Is it for the people? And if it is for the people, which people is it for?

Woodie King, Jr. 00:18:10.650
Right. I think, personally, it's for the people, right? And the plays that I produced are first and foremost aimed at a black audience, you know. And I got to think of the medium income level of that black audience in this country now, you know what I mean. And naturally if there are 22 million or 25 million black people in this country, and you figure the theater going audience out of that figure is one fourth of one percent, [laughing] you know what I mean, then naturally I've  got to think a little bit broader and more, you know, I gotta think that somehow I got to get some of those 180 million white people in to see it as well, you know, since that audience is 4 percent, you know, as 4 percent of that total amount. So naturally, when I produce a play I have to have that in my mind, you know.

Speaker 11 00:19:04.320
But I was thinking not just of the financial situation I was thinking about the scope of the play the types of topics the approaches that are used to true that black theater is so exciting because it comes out of Black Lightning in my arms out of lifestyle that comes out of African and Afro-American heritage comes oppression comes out of poverty. And it comes closer to tapping the real emotions of people I guess.

Speaker 6 00:19:35.750
So many people get tired of seeing plays about middle class husbands and wives can get lonely job particularly in the bedroom and that raises you know other kinds of question because a lot of other things that are happening in this world people starving people striving people applying to more families and whole families together in a sense this is what the prodigal sister is about right. Right.

Speaker 9 00:19:58.570
So it's a black family play you know but the plays that I do I aim at a black audience first and foremost lawyers explore that.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:20:06.930
We're talking with Woody King producer of the new hit play the prodigal sister and we're talking about black theater and the development of black theater. And you've just made the point Woody that places the plays that you produce off for black audiences now. I'm sure some people will say well what does that mean that would be different than if the play was produced for a general audience which includes whites and blacks would you wow a general audience.

Speaker 7 00:20:35.880
There is no such thing as a general generalized as many white. Yeah right right right. All right. Well what does that mean now when you say well what do you do differently. OK.

Speaker 9 00:20:44.040
So I don't have one when we put the play together music and everything we first think of what will a black person think of this.

Speaker 13 00:20:56.330
I mean we I mean people working on this production across the board they're middle class. There are some people students in school there. I mean it's across the board we represent I think that black audience out there. OK. And first and foremost we said What will a black all you think of this scene.

Speaker 9 00:21:14.990
You know we think it's funny we think it won't work or they think it's so degrading it's degrading. We take it our media they take it we take it we take it out we don't deal with what a white person would think of it you know like in the 60s we used to talk well a white person won't understand this. Let's make it so you can understand that we don't do that anymore. You know that was in the early.

Speaker 6 00:21:37.460
But it does not raise the question which some blacks have raised even on this program and that is always a question of all black people are like. No because all people do black people understand because much of the modern drama comes from the black urban experience which has some commonalities but I forget who it was was on the show but we were talking about blacks laying one on one program and it was pointed up at a particular piece of black black slang meant three different things in three different cities. Right. And the question was being developed there is New York the center of the black world and as everything we do in New York reflect the way in which black people in general feel all along we develop these plays are we really developing for the black New York City dash Philadelphia audience and maybe what happens out in the black community in Cleveland Gary and Kansas City might not be reflected in this. How do you feel about that.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:22:33.760
OK well when we develop plays develop first. If we in Philadelphia it was developed for Philadelphia black audience you know now we're developing for New York black audience. You know those people that come in out of the city to see it during the summer and you know doing the run won't be.

Speaker 15 00:22:51.560
I think it won't be that many you know uses the New York black audience that will make the play work or won't make it work if they don't understand it's not going to work because then the white people will say wait what are they doing to their black friends. I don't know. You know now if I'm most of the black people who work and go to the theater in New York we have white associates white friends you know if they say to a white friend you got to see this place the greatest thing in the world.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:23:22.340
You can bet that white person going to see it and also probably understand a good deal of us right on if it does at least be moved to ask I believe you have one or two other plays with the wine cellars by on the road. Right. And that is a play about a pimp who tries to entice a young girl Elin's girlfriend into the oldest profession in the world.

Speaker 6 00:23:45.020
Her rejection of it. What has been the reception there. Because I imagine you go to college campuses and you go to some of the other urban communities urban communities.

Speaker 15 00:23:56.220
And I believe we had a West Coast and we had a West Coast company. We've had Lincoln fin and company and now we got a we had a Henry Street new federal company. Now we have our company on the road. Last month we played Philadelphia. It's in Detroit now. It'll be in Detroit through the middle of January and then we move on to St. Lewis. But again I move it. I play urban northern cities you know eventually I hope to get down to Atlanta because I really want to play Atlanta. You know I really think that's one of the. What do you think about themes and black theater. You know we've gone through the late 60s with the very very angry themes themes calling literally for revolution and physical break out from the oppression in the themes that have been more introspective themes about black family life a lot of things about black women.

Speaker 12 00:24:55.370
What about things like black theater. One of the things I've noticed is we really haven't had a lot of comedy.

Speaker 6 00:25:02.660
And whereas I'm not talking about minstrel show necessarily Carbone I'm talking about. OK. Five on the black hand side. I mean the film was a comedy writers who have fantastic company.

Speaker 8 00:25:14.010
In fact the play to the play was a good plot. Of course Charlie Russell's play. What. What are some. How is it developing as black theater becoming more personal. Is it becoming psychological is becoming more political is it.

Speaker 9 00:25:32.450
Well it's what is it what's happening OK what's happening. The sub themes on Black plays are moving into politics more than like in the 60s. The main plot the main themes are the politics a revolution you know moving into the 70s you was noticed the same place where the subtext is political and revolutionary. Right. For example like an early 70s you saw Ed bulletins play The Fabulous Miss Marie here. You know on the surface on the surface that was a like hilarious comedy you know about the West Coast middle class. The subtext on it was strictly and very clearly and very precisely revolutionary. Right. You see a play like our political system where the subtext is very much political. You know it's it's it's political. I mean that's what Jay Franklin is about. You know it's very also very religious. You know I mean because we all are moving in to the development and the study of religion as a political force to bring people together. I mean most artists are doing that now in the 70s I don't know.

Woodie King, Jr. 00:26:49.230
You know I don't know if you elaborate on that point a little religion as political folk.

Speaker 9 00:26:54.860
Well black people are basically religious you know spiritual in nature. That's why you will always find our mothers and a lot of us in involved in some sort of church activity one way or another at that activity. A lot of the artists have found that is a way to get their message out but because the people are brought together in that body at that one place. And so most of their art will reflect that.

Speaker 11 00:27:26.040
Well it is certainly true that there have been a tremendous number of performers artists political figures Martin Luther King Jesse Jackson coming out of black religion and now that certainly is a a major part of black life as we come to the close of our program possibly you might want to tell the audience again exactly where they might be able to get some tickets for the particles at the theater to lease 121 Christopher Street New York City. And the numbers w a 4 8 7 8 2. And we hope to run forever.
