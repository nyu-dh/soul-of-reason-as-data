Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:00:01.540
Is the City University of New York meeting the needs of minority and low income youth? Are there sufficient numbers of Black and Puerto Rican faculty on the staff of the City University? What is the future of its special programs? Here, Dr. Hilda Fortune, Professor of sociology at York College of the City University of New York answered these questions on tonight Soul of Reason. This is Soul of Reason, a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. Soul of Reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University. With us tonight on Soul of Reason is Dr. Hilda Fortune, who is a full professor of sociology at York College in Queens, which is part of the City University system. And one of the things we want to talk about tonight, Hilda, is the effectiveness of the City University in meeting the needs of Blacks and other minorities. And I'd like to start out by just asking you a direct question, that is how effective has the City University of New York through all of its branches been in meeting the needs of this special group of students?

Hilda Fortune 00:01:38.840
Well to answer to that, Roscoe, I have to give you a bit of history, and I know you're well acquainted with this. It hasn't been too long ago that Blacks were just beginning to come into the City University in large numbers. And that was around the time of what we call the Black Revolution.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:52.730
Why were Blacks not in the City University previously in large numbers?

Hilda Fortune 00:01:56.600
Well there were no particular programs to bring Blacks in, and the standards were very high in some of the colleges, and Blacks, by their standards, of course, did not qualify.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:06.113
Was that because they didn't have the ability or because of some other social phenomenon?

Hilda Fortune 00:02:10.370
Well many, many problems. I was at Brooklyn College--my first entry into the City University was Brooklyn--and there the entry score was, at the time, 87. Now that's very, very high.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:21.261
87 high school average.

Hilda Fortune 00:02:22.731
87 what they call combination. They would combine the high school average and the S.A.T. average and--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:30.590
The College Board.

Hilda Fortune 00:02:30.593
Yes, and then a test which they gave at Brooklyn College. And this brought it up to about 87 percent. This is tough, you know, really tough to get in.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:39.140
And because the educational programs in areas where Black and Puerto Rican students tend to go generally are not as good as they are in the more affluent sections of the city. This led to there not being a large number of Blacks and Puerto Ricans and low income whites for that matter going into the City U prior to '68, '69. Is that about when it began to change?

Hilda Fortune 00:03:01.710
That's correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:03:01.712
And that was due to the development of the SEEK program and then later on the open admissions policy, I believe.

Hilda Fortune 00:03:08.210
Well again history--if you recall when the students took over City College, they moved the target date for admitting minorities down from '75 to to '68 or '69. It was only then that they began to take in Blacks and Puerto Ricans in larger numbers. They started with this open admissions program, which is still being tested. So now we are getting Black and Puerto Rican students in, and the corollary to that is that we're getting more Black and Puerto Rican faculty.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:03:36.260
Well let's talk about the effectiveness of the program for these Black and Puerto Rican students. You said that the target date for admitting larger numbers of students who didn't meet the normal requirements was moved from 1975 down to 1968 or '69. And this was basically due to a sit-in. Do you mean that physical pressure and the threat of violence caused people in the City University to do things that they didn't think was good judgment, or they thought it was good judgment and because of the political protest they were able to get the money to implement the program?

Hilda Fortune 00:04:12.470
Well they moved a little faster. As I said they had a target date for it. But I think the movement on the part of students activated their program. Instead of '75 they brought it down, and they opened up the school quicker.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:04:26.090
Well as a result of opening up the school quicker, have these students been helped? Has the university really met the needs of this new group of students? For example, I hear that over 50 percent of the open admission students are white, well which reflects probably the economic situation within the city, and are not all Black or all Puerto Rican as some opponents of open admissions have said. But taking this group collectively, how effective has the City University been in meeting their needs, at least in your perception?

Hilda Fortune 00:05:02.340
Well I would say they have a good start but there's a long way to go. Many of the students came in with some deficiencies and it was understood that the University would have supportived remedial programs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:05:14.872
Understood by whom?

Hilda Fortune 00:05:16.281
By the public and by the faculty and by the administration. And money was allocated, as you know, for the SEEK program, and they did set up tutorial services and--[crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:05:25.681
The SEEK program predates the open admissions and the SEEK program was that search for education--

Hilda Fortune 00:05:33.622
Elevation and--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:05:34.372
Elevation and knowledge did have built into it this extra amount of counseling and reading services and tutoring and the like. One of the allegations that I've heard is that similar services were not built into the open admissions program, and as a result the attrition rate has been somewhat higher than the average student who had been entering previously.

Hilda Fortune 00:05:58.970
Well this is true. The average turnover in the colleges runs about 30 percent. The average turnover as I recall among the open admission students may run around 50 percent.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:06:11.061
So those are the figures that are in my mind too.

Hilda Fortune 00:06:12.861
Yes, and some people say that it's the revolving door, that you satisfy the public by admitting youngsters who graduated from college, but you have no programs to hold them there. And they have set up a few programs, a few tutorial programs and some remedial courses and some specialized counseling. But there is some criticism that this is not sufficient, that they are not enough staff to ma these programs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:06:37.880
Well some of the large Midwestern universities have been doing this for years. Taking in--by law, they have to take in anyone who's a high school graduate, and they rotate them in. And sometimes that turnover rate is not 50 percent, but between 60 and 70 percent, which at least in my opinion, is unconscionable. Now you had indicated that some moneys were to be--had been made available, and maybe have been made available by now to help alleviate this situation.

Speaker 8 00:07:06.080
But some other people have suggested that some of the faculty in the City University who were already there were somewhat hostile to a new group of students whom they perceived as not being as evil as requiring more help at things which they probably should have gotten in high school and as a result didn't put themselves out to give them this additional help. Is this a correct allegation is it something that only happened with a few or is it just a function of the size the vastness of the City University. Well I think that. You will find some committed faculty people who are very happy to have the opportunity to work with young people who have been deprived because of the system and then the system by the system by the Educational Complex. Oh OK.

Hilda Fortune 00:07:57.560
And I think you have some who still have an ivory tower concept of the academic world and they are so elitist and I think they they think they should teach students who come into the elite category. Well how do you deal with the argument that says that if you have a student body I'm not saying this is in fact the case but if you have a student body that has a very very low reading level let's say the eighth grade when they come into college that this just pulls down the standard of the whole school. Now I know that there are programs that are devised to deal with that situation but how do you really deal with that argument with your colleagues who say we used to have youngsters come in here with reading levels of 12 and 14 years and now we have to deal with youngsters with reading levels of eight years. What is your argument as a colleague to professors who say this is cheapening the currency of a city university education how do you respond to that.

Speaker 9 00:08:57.170
Well I respond very negatively to that. I feel they have a responsibility. I mean how do you respond to them to them.

Speaker 6 00:09:02.960
Oh I'd tell them and I have said it rather publicly that there's a lack of commitment on their part and also a reluctance to do more work. I think that is a challenge really to work with young people who haven't had a chance. I don't think all agree with me but to me this is a challenge.

Hilda Fortune 00:09:21.860
And in the long run I would imagine that you don't think it cheapens a currency. No it's what you're suggesting then because of the extra work that it takes to meet this challenge that the people who graduate will be close to the same quality of the people who have graduated in previous years.

Speaker 10 00:09:40.910
Is that do you think they should test the test is is how many are able to graduate and those who do graduate do meet the standards.

Speaker 8 00:09:47.750
Well that might give some justification to the revolving door policy that maybe what they are doing by eliminating 50 percent in that first year is saying well it's 50 percent and can't cut the mustard and therefore we only want to work with the 50 percent who can. What's your belief about that particular position.

Speaker 10 00:10:05.750
Well I I think those who can have responsible to help those who cannot and take for example peer teaching. I think you you know how this has worked out. When a student who can helps a student who cannot both benefit but a student who can benefits more than a student who can. Some of the research has shown this to be true in peer teaching so that when we use young people who have abilities who have talent to help the others those who have ability do profit they do benefit. And I think this is something that the college has not pointed out. So we have the myth that those who have talent are suffering and this is not necessarily true. They are to be used by the faculty if they know how to do this. They ought to be used to help those who who are having problems.

Speaker 8 00:10:54.250
That's a very good point. However my question had to do with the fact that maybe it is a good social policy to expect 50 percent to flunk out. If you're going to continue to maintain the quality of the school and then I guess what I was asking you was whether you think that it's appropriate that 50 percent of the open enrollment youngsters should flunk out or do you think it should be a smaller number. Well if you think it should be a smaller number. Well if it is a smaller number how do you retain students who are not performing and still maintain the quality of the school. Well first of all let's set this way. I think those who are who are. In college and we know this is true not only of the open Missions group but in college because of the pressure. And this is very true. You have to look the reasons why young people go to college some go to college because you under pressure to go some go to college because it is Vogue some go to college because they feel that this will help them job wise so that happens to be true. Yes of course the last letter one especially that's more schooling the better the salary so they say I think those who who drop out perhaps are not college bound then what they call college material and we don't have to assume that everyone is and this isn't true only open admissions is true. I think that the general college population and this is one reason you have 30 percent dropping out. So maybe 50 isn't so many as you suggested a few minutes ago. When you look at it from an overall point of view and we find also in this I think is a phenomenon that many who do drop out sometimes double back after they've had an experience on the outside world again. And I used to counsel students who said well I don't know if I should be here. And I said What did what do you think you would like to do. Well I'm not so sure yet. So I take time to think about that and maybe get a job for a semester and I find when I do come back they are more dedicated than because they wash dishes. Well I do find it hard the world is out there. Yeah.

Speaker 11 00:12:57.670
One other thing that comes up in the whole idea of the open admissions is that it doesn't guarantee everyone a four year degree and guarantees them education commensurate with the interest and abilities and some of the programs in the community colleges at least are certificate terminal programs. Once individuals learn a particular skill and then some of those programs such as in fashion or in computing or in metallurgy the salaries are very good even without a degree even without a two year A.S. certificate applied our social and flight arts certificate. So I think that possibly you have a counselling vacuum. I. What about the adequacy of your counselling services. We talked about the professors the way in which they teach. We talked about the tutoring their peer involvement and tutoring. What about counseling. How important and how adequate are the counselling services provided.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:03.190
Now in the City University for your open admission students.

Speaker 10 00:14:06.280
Well I don't think we have enough counselors and I don't think that some of the counselors are prepared to work with disadvantaged young people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:13.540
Well what kind of preparation is it take to work with disadvantaged young people.

Speaker 10 00:14:16.720
Well I was looking at a study the other day of a in-service training program in Phoenix. And you mentioned earlier that out west they have made progress and working with disadvantaged young people. This particular program was trying very hard to bring blacks in Mexican councils into the system because they felt they had an advantage of color. The advantage of language for the Spanish speaking and they also had an advantage of being able to identify socioeconomically because many of us started from the bottom and they felt that if they could recruit more minority counselors to work with minority youngsters that the young people would have an up they'd have a leg up on this. So they set up because they were not able to find qualified counselors who met the certification.

Speaker 6 00:15:03.640
They recruited teachers and they gave them in service and they set up a practicum for them. And as soon as they were able to work through their training they were move right into the counseling. And this kept down a number of explosions which this this particular school system thought they were set up to have you say explosion. You mean one student riots and discontent and dropping out.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:15:27.550
All right well in the open admission situation the main role of the counselor is to help the student to mobilize his energies to stay in school. And in addition to the counselors there is a question of the ID with minority faculty which brings us to another question and that has to do with the the adequacy of the numbers of black and Puerto Rican faculty members and staff members and counselors in the City University.

Speaker 6 00:15:57.370
How is that shaping up in spite of the affirmative action program there still are not enough faculty and counselors and administrators black and poor you say not enough.

Speaker 11 00:16:13.330
I then moved to ask a question. What is enough.

Speaker 6 00:16:17.380
Well let's say proportionate to the population and I use that because of a recent study that came out over the weekend. And this study disturbed me. It was published by the Carnegie Commission. And in the study it suggested that. By the year 2000. We still would not have. The number of women and minorities in the universities in proportion to the population with the end with the population in New York averaging 25 or 30 percent black and Puerto Ricans. A grade in New York. We still have less than 10 percent of minorities in the City University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:16:57.520
I see now is that a purpose of thing where the City University just doesn't want to hire minorities or is it a question of available positions or is it a question of the training and the equipment that different minorities bring to the school situation.

Speaker 6 00:17:17.980
I would say all all three of those Roscoe industry use the one that blacks never apply the academic world uses the argument that it's hard to find blacks with P HD which is true which is very true. I know that in sociology we really tried this last year. And they sent letters around to the press and they sent letters to the colleges and they went to the conferences are being held where blacks were assembling and we got no results on that because black pastors are very much and men you everyone's looking for them. The Southern colleges and the colleges elsewhere. Also this there is some truth in this but there are ways to do this. Now what we did in sociology we had a very alert young man black who was working on his doctorate. And he was working as agile at York and we worked this out that we would move him in as an assistant instructor with the with the expectations that when he finished his doctorate he would become a full time line person. So there are ways to do it. And I think if people are committed to it they're really sincere about it. Affirmative action says if you operate in good faith and I think really if you do operate in good faith you can find some answers.

Hilda Fortune 00:18:33.430
Well of course some of the answers are limited by the number of available lines or positions.

Speaker 11 00:18:39.370
For example if a given department has most of its staff members tenured and the rest of them permanent and only let's say 2 percent of them or two of 40 people a black Puerto Rican this doesn't make it very easy to get somebody else in which raises some other kinds of questions.

Speaker 12 00:19:00.910
Do is there a kind of a negative reaction among some of the staff to the affirmative action idea or is it just a question of lack of aggressiveness in pursuing blacks Puerto Rican and also women in the case of affirmative action. Well you know that's that's a very hot issue right now because those who have are saying that.

Speaker 6 00:19:26.320
The push for integration and hiring more minorities and women is discrimination reverse and they're saying that the affirmative action authorities are setting up quotas and this is really something that I think is beginning to tear the universe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:19:41.690
Well Art let me ask you the question do you think they are setting up if not quotas goals.

Speaker 6 00:19:48.280
Goals.

Speaker 12 00:19:48.910
Yes I would accept that suggests that some of the goals might be over the next five years if you're going to hire 10 people five of them would be minority women.

Speaker 8 00:19:57.190
Yes I think it is being misconstrued on black to be well to be brutally honest about it. If these 10 positions in the past had gone to white males to say now that they want to go to everything else being equal to blacks Puerto Rico's a women that in fact does limit the options of the group that has had the benefit of the system.

Hilda Fortune 00:20:20.860
And I think this is something that people like you who are in advocacy positions are going to have to deal with. I think it does involve a tremendous amount of understanding because the real argument that is difficult to deal with and that is that by hiring a black or a Puerto Rican or a woman you're actually not hiring the most qualified person. And that raises some other kinds of questions. How do you deal with that kind of question when it comes up. Well first I would have to say if you want to get into the women and women bit there are qualified women within the system and the in certain fields in certain fields and the studies have shown that they are hired at entry levels at the lowest salaries and also the study of the university will show that there's been a dominant number of blacks at the entry level and that the lower salary.

Speaker 9 00:21:14.810
Why do you think that is. Oh well this is where the.

Hilda Fortune 00:21:20.960
The lines are. As you said before entry lines they really have full professor lines available. They rarely have associate lines available. Sometimes they have a system lines available.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:21:31.160
I do know see situations where they brought into the city university professors and associates when they had years of teaching experience and the doctor's degree is it not possible at the predominance of blacks and Puerto Ricans at least at the lower end is due to the fact that not a large number of them have either the doctor degree which is the requirement for a professorial position all they experience is that a possibility.

Speaker 10 00:21:58.280
That's a possibility. And as we said before there not that many black P H D but I do think we have a responsibility to to encourage and to make available in-service training and also opportunities for people to work on their doctor while they are employed.

Hilda Fortune 00:22:14.750
Because some people would say that the doctor's degree is really a paper requirement and it doesn't really mean anything. And what we should do rather than trying to encourage blacks and Puerto Rican women to get the doctor's degree is to eliminate that as a requirement. What do you think of that as a strategy in contrast with trying to get more blacks and Puerto Ricans into doctoral type programs.

Speaker 6 00:22:42.620
Well I would go along with that. As a matter of fact I was very well rather enchanted by program in at Kent College where they took welfare recipients to come in and teach about the teach the welfare courses because they knew more about them than some of the professors did who had not who had never been on welfare. And they called in professors of the street. I am quite willing to bend somebody's requirements to help meet the needs of the students.

Speaker 10 00:23:11.180
And I think this should be the the the goal. What can we do to get these students said of putting all the the the build up on credentials. Well that certainly is a very good point. However when you deal with the system and you have bends in the system and you don't have checks and balances if rather than these bends or flexibility is being idiosyncratic and her only occasionally if they become the rule then you do have another kind of problem.

Speaker 11 00:23:42.350
It is certainly easy to criticize the doctor's degree as a requirement for a professorial position. On the other hand when you try to develop a system where other things substitute for it it does make it much more difficult to police. For example in the case that you gave about the professors of the street with the tenure regulation being as it is named after a person has been hired for a certain period of time. What do you do with people that you bring in who don't have the credential flexibility because whereas the credentials are not always meaningful. Usually they do assure that a person has been exposed to a certain variety of experiences and maybe rather than teaching just one cause he might be able to teach four or five.

Speaker 8 00:24:29.690
So that raises a practical problem to deal with. What basically is your model.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:24:35.930
I know there is a faculty and personnel Association of Blacks and Puerto Ricans at the City University. What are you really encouraging your members to do in terms of dealing with a movement within the city university system.

Speaker 10 00:24:48.440
Well we had a meeting yesterday and it was titled workshop UNC careers for black personnel and in Canyon City University. And we got on this business of credentials and of course people were encouraged to meet the requirements by getting the doctorate but we also thought that we also got into waivers and we know that there are a lot of waivers for people and this is some of the politics that goes on in this inner city university as well as other universities. And we feel if as if it's being done for some it should be done for others.

Speaker 11 00:25:19.430
Well in a sense you'd have to do it and probably a disproportionately larger number for blacks Puerto Ricans because not that many have the degrees at this point.

Hilda Fortune 00:25:30.410
This puts you right into the political arena which raises another question about the fact that the city university is probably too politicized now. What is your view in got to that do you think there should be more politics in the city university or less. I would say less as you know right now. There's there's pressure on the City University from Albany. And everyone's crying politics at the same time we're not dealing with the politics that's internal. And I think this is something we ought to address ourselves to.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:26:01.230
How do you how do you best deal with those kind of internal politics.

Hilda Fortune 00:26:04.620
Well I think the front of actions is is going to help a lot with this because as one of the speakers said yesterday Bill Zeller the president of the Professional Staff Congress which represents the City University instructional staff she said that you won't be able to say I have an opening send me somebody. She said because of affirmative action you're going to have to say we have openings and let's recruit. And we also announced we have to announce that you have to post openings and you have to recruit broadly and you have to show good faith by not only recruiting in the professional journals but also in the media where you will be in contact with minorities.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:26:39.660
Well as we come toward the close of our program tonight I was wondering what your general assessment of the City University is do you think it will become more responsive to blacks and Puerto Ricans and low income people of all backgrounds.

Hilda Fortune 00:26:54.570
I think it has to I think it has to to be true to its own own concepts and purpose and philosophy. If you recall when the university was started 125 years ago there was free tuition and they didn't admit people and then we became a little elitist.

Speaker 9 00:27:09.540
And I think the tuition was always free. But the standards stand me up and up and up and now I think we're going back to our original purpose and that is to admit people give everyone an opportunity and support those who need help within the system.

Hilda Fortune 00:27:21.270
But ultimately it does require a great deal of effort effort on the part of faculty effort on the part of the students and effort on the part of administration effort and commitment.

Speaker 12 00:27:31.830
And as you say an increasing awareness of the political process related to the City University both in and out of the university. Absolutely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:27:42.060
All right I'd like to thank you Hilda Dr. Hilda fortune professor of sociology at York College of the City University of New York for being with us tonight on soul of reason and discussing the impact of open admissions on the City University and various things that have been done to make the City University more responsive to the needs of blacks and Puerto Ricans. Thank you. Hold it. Mr. Mayor thank you for having me.
