Did you know that over one million children in New York City are in need of childcare. And only 42000 are receiving these services from New York City. Here Robert Davis assistant commissioner of the agency for child development in New York City discuss these questions on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:39.470
This is "Soul of Reason." A program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:06.740
With us tonight on "Soul of Reason" is Bob Davis who is Assistant Commissioner of New York City's Agency for Child Development which is the agency in New York City that is responsible for coordinating child care services. And Bob as we said in introducing the show. Over a million children in New York City do need child care services. Could you tell us something about what kind of services they need and what kind of services the city is providing? And, of course, the 64000 dollar question why aren't more services being provided.

Bob Davis 00:01:39.740
Well, that's a good take off Dr. Brown. First of all, let me thank you for inviting us to participate on your show. And let me also give you a little background on the Agency for Child Development.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:51.021
Okay, that's beautiful.

Bob Davis 00:01:52.851
We tend to think that it's a rather unique agency. Mainly because we are the only child development agency in the country -- the Agency for Child Development was created by executive order of Mayor Lindsay back in 1971 -- July 1st 1971 -- to be specific. Our focus at that time was to bring together a conglomeration of services that existed in this city into one umbrella agency to provide some continuity for our child care programs. Of course you know the this the emphasis was on expanding our program and and improving the quality of programs that we have now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:38.270
Didn't some of this come out of the overall War on Poverty the new emphasis beginning in the mid '60s on trying to provide more people services and I know the Lindsay administration has been both praised and damned for its efforts in this direction but it attempted to bring together agencies that had similar functions because there are myriad many, many different units in city government. Previous to this time and he might've called these super agencies is the agency for child development one of the super agencies.

Bob Davis 00:03:15.050
Well it certainly is a part of the Human Resources Administration. We are one of the constituent agencies in that overall body...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:03:26.120
and that will continue to HRA will continue to exist under the Beame Administration?

Bob Davis 00:03:30.661
Well, we can't say that with any certainty at this point. I do know that they are planning a reorganization of HRA which, of course, was one of Mayor Beame's campaign commitment. There are a lot of things that we can criticize about soup agencies on. But certainly I don't want to overshadow that by saying that a lot of positive things also that we have identified and we want to maintain. I tend to think that sometimes we throw the baby out with the bath in order to accomplish change simply for the purpose of change. The Human Resources Administration I think has done a fantastic job in the delivery of social services to people not only poor people of this city but all citizens of this city. When you talk about senior citizen programs, child care programs, of course, employment programs and they have the responsibility for administering the welfare program in this city which is a massive program.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:04:27.170
One of the things that many people aren't aware of is that New York City is probably the second largest governmental unit in the whole nation and its budget in its size is much larger than many, many nations. And when something goes wrong and it gets on the first page of the newspapers showing just how the city doesn't care. I think that it causes many citizens to forget just the magnitude of the operation. For example, a million children who need child care services. What kind of services do they need? How can and should a city governmental agency go about providing them? For example, what does the agency for child development try to do in this dimension?

Bob Davis 00:05:14.720
Okay, well, since 1971, of course, on our emphasis, and I repeated it again, has been on expanding the number of child care facilities we have in the city as well as improving the quality. Now let me talk about the expansion because that's the area that I'm primarily concerned with as the assistant commissioner in charge of facilities development. When I came aboard this -- this was under the the auspices of Jack Goldberg who was the then the Commissioner of Social Services. Childcare was still under that jurisdiction DSS, as per se, he created the special office for day care and I became the first director of that unit. And at that time we had approximately 6000 youngsters in care, in group daycare in this city and it's throughout the five boroughs... That really isn't very many. That was... very... ...and under Title IV, the Title IX A legislation of the Social Security Act -- it was 1967 --there was money in that budget almost a bottomless pit for child care and we developed the direct leasing plan which means that a private owner would come in to the agency and make an offer for space or building a structure for childcare purposes and lease it to the city of New York on a long term basis. And that has been the program that has been primarily responsible for the tremendous growth. Now we've had a growth rate of about one hundred percent per year for the last four years and that's rather phenomenal. When you when you when you look at other states and cities across this country it's a tremendous growth rate. And we're very proud of that and we think that the the Agency for Child Development, while at the same time trying to improve quality has been in laying a foundation for a unique kind of an agency has also expanded programs continuously. And I might add, you know, Dr. Brown, that we have 66 new facilities in construction at this particular point in time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:07:23.040
This is sort of a mind-blowing set of statistics. One of the things that comes to my mind is, and this might be a simplistic question, why are so many new facilities needed? And I'm relating that to the one million and you can develop that point,, and the other, of course, which is even more mind-blowing is what did people do before they had these facilities?

Bob Davis 00:07:45.810
Well, the latter question is certainly the most interesting because we we know of any number of illegal child care operations in this city. Some people refer to them as bootleg operations where a group of parents or a group of interests as citizens come together and form a group and rent a store front or whatever and try and provide some kind of a group daycare, you know service, for the people who are the citizens of a given community. And I want to speak more about that because we did get in there about three years ago and try and provide some assistance to many of those groups. However, we still know that there is a plethoria of groups like this around the city that we have not even gotten close to helping and because of our funding situation at this point we will not be in a position to help unless something comes through at the city, state. or federal level.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:08:37.440.0000000000582
In other words, the childcare sort of a natural service growing out of the fact that in our society not only are there a number of fatherless families where women have to work but they also an increasing number of families where both husbands and wives work. And therefore there is a considerable need for facilities to care for young children while these folk are working or sick or what have you. And unlike some other countries, notably some of the Eastern Bloc countries, that for decades have provided services for children, it's only more recently that this is becoming to be sort of a broadly accepted thing and I'm almost cynical enough to suggest that it has mainly become broadly acceptable as more middle class families have gotten into both husband and wife working and the pressure of the middle class and their access to the media, access to greater financial resources, their access to the political structure has now made childcare fashionable and that combined with the pressure of growing out of the social revolution of the '60s where poor people have said this is our right. That puts a lot of pressure on folks like you. For example, are many your facilities tuned in or service do many of them service middle class families? Or are you limited solely to what might be called poor families?

Bob Davis 00:10:09.330
Well, that's a very timely question. We are in the midst of a battle at this particular point in time with the State. Let me go back about a year and a half ago when the S State came up with new eligibility requirements for families to receive services in our child care centers. We think it's very restrictive. It tends to to lock out those families who have where you have two people working and the income, of course, increases as a result of that. We were able to get Governor Rockefeller at the time to provide an additional 15 million dollars throughout the state and to delay the implementation of those guidelines until July 1st of this year. Well, on July 1st of this year we were notified that we had to put in force those new eligibility requirements for the acceptance of service. And on September 1, unless something rather magnificent happens, we're gonna be in a position of forcing over six thousand youngsters who presently participate in our program out. All those families will have to pay the full cost of care... And the full cost is quite a bit expensive... ...could be over one hundred dollars a month. Which means that the family could go out and have their kid enroll in a private daycare center for that kind of money. Plus it tends to force people right back into that cycle of welfare. And we just know that many of the families out there are going to have some family breakdown some dissension as a result of the pullback on the services that we've traditionally provided in this city for over 25 years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:11:50.663
Well, what is the social philosophy that leads this to happen? Because as we pointed out, on one hand, as more middle class parents have gotten into using daycare services has become more socially acceptable. And as you suggest already some of these middle class folk are benefiting from public centers and then, of course, a much larger number are supporting private centers. Now what is happening to cause tragedy -- and I would say this is a tragedy like this to happen? Is it because of alleged, misuse, alleged mismanagement of social philosophy. It says that this shouldn't be done at public expense. What in your opinion has brought this particular manner of thinking about?

Bob Davis 00:12:41.901
That's a question that's certainly bewildered a lot of people in this city -- not only this city I think in the country in general as to why when we talk about social services it's so restrictive that is it's very...it tends to provide services only to the very poor. Now let me make something very clear. Not saying that poor people in this city are not entitled to and probably need more desperately the kind of services that we have to offer. But I think that when we live in a multi-ethnic, multi-economic kind of a society we should try and provide a daycare center that reflects or mirrors the kind of society that we live in, which means that we're talking about services for all people and for all economic groups. If it went...with some limitations, of course. But let me just tell you what kind of impact these fee scales are going to have on a number of our families. The way it stands now with the new guidelines that we will have to put in force in the next month or so, for a family of four with a net income of eighty five hundred dollars per year... Which is not a lot of money. That's a heck of a lot below what the average family makes in this country which is twelve thousand dollars. Right. Well, that family would pay fourteen dollars and fifty cents per week for the service. If they earn over eighty five hundred dollars, let's say they are nine thousand dollars then that family is not eligible for child care services with some federal subsidy and federal state or city subsidy. They would have to pay the full cost of care

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:13.402
Which is about?

Bob Davis 00:14:15.263
Could be over one hundred dollars a week depending on you know...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:17.570
Over a 100 dollars a week?

Bob Davis 00:14:18.530
I'm sorry. Let me correct that. One hundred dollars a month.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:21.772
But still that's a substantial amount...[crosstalk]

Bob Davis 00:14:22.852
That's a substantial increase over what they were paying...[crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:25.820
...because that's, for example, twelve hundred dollars a year. And if a family has just gotten over the 9000 limit to then go back and have to pay twelve hundred dollars that's like going back to seven eight so...[crosstalk]

Bob Davis 00:14:37.201
It defeats the whole purpose.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:14:37.791
It defeats the particularly the purpose. I can identify with the idea of the multi-ethic in the multi multi-socioeconomic character of the Center. But another part of the sentence is to make it possible for people who are gradually moving up the economic ladder to do so. And the minute they get across a minimum point because the most recent statistics show that the average white family in America has an income of about twelve thousand five hundred dollars a year the average black family unfortunately is far behind it with income of about seventy nine hundred dollars a year. So when you begin to just barely creep toward what might be called some level of subsistence as a lower middle class family you get zapped by this type of regulation. It is quite conceivable this is part of a social philosophy which really is kind of a trickle philosophy. That you trickle enough of the goodies down to the poor so that they don't get too disruptive...restive. On the other hand, if you're going to if you have 42000 people in your centers now children and you're going to knock out sixty six hundred I think you're gonna have a lot of disruption of one type or another.

Bob Davis 00:15:55.911
Well, I think that disruption has already begun. I do know of instances where whole entire communities have come together and coalesced to bring pressure on both the city and the state to turn around these regulations. I might add that we expect some new federal regulations, eligibility regulations all around the first of the year. And it seems so pointless to institute a new set of regulations in September. When we expect something to come out of the federal government in a matter of four or five months. The amount of money that we're talking about is not very much in order to maintain the people who are already in the program we tend to think that ought to grandfathered those families in. Of course, you own...for new families that's gonna be another fight. The families who are trying to get their youngsters in the daycare program, but I think it's a it's a terrible thing to do to a child to have him participate in a program, to make friends, to begin to learn how to live with his neighbors, to appreciate what his neighbors brings to him what his community brings to him, and what he in turn can bring to a community, to say to him that he can no longer come to the daycare center because his family earns a few dollars too much. With the inflationary situation we have in the city you know the kind of dollars we're talking about are almost worthless. To do that to that youngster seemed to be a crime against children. And, of course, we're going to do everything we can to try to turn those regulations around and I expect to get know broadbase suppor from this. Now Commissioner McMurray -- Commissioner Georgia McMurray who heads up AC DC has been a leader in this field. I think she's probably one of the most respected persons in the child development field in this country. She has waged battle after battle. To open up child care centers to the people of this city to to give it you know the kind of leadership that it's had. And we do. We appreciate that. And I think many people in this city have grown to to think a great deal over you know the kind of work that she's done in this field.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:18:09.440
Well, then as we think about what the future of child care is and as we relate this to this one million children...[crosstalk]

Bob Davis 00:18:18.954
One million plus.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:18:19.980
...in New York City who have some need in some way for child care. And then we look at the 42000 and see that that might be cut back a little. This does raise the budgetary question: how much money really is being spent in New York City on child care and your opinion opinion of the agency how much needs to be spent?

Bob Davis 00:18:41.090
Well ,presently our budget is around one hundred forty six million dollars and it's rather substantially increased. When you look at it in comparison to what we had five years ago. When I first started five six years ago it was about eighteen point six million dollars --- that's what the six thousand kids. When we began to really take advantage of the federal legislation, we, as I said, have increased the number of facilities about 100 percent every year. And we've gotten to a point about one hundred and forty six million dollars. Now certainly we need more money. We had to take an act, I guess it was May of 1973, which ran counter to everything we believe in because the agency was created as I said to expand. We had to tell over 200 community groups who had sites approved already and at various stages are working on drawings with our architects or securing land for the purpose of putting a child care center there, that we could no longer do business with them because of the cutbacks and the federal funds, and particularly as relates to social service spending, we just did not have the capability of providing the kinds of moneys that it would take to put up these facilities. And as a result the last two years, for all practical purposes, we have not accepted any new sites. But I, Dr. Brown, I'd like to get back to something you mentioned in regard to what do parents do, groups get involved in when there is no publicly funded child care facility in their neighborhood? And we talked for a few minutes about the the interim program. That program got started as a result of parents coming together and saying we're gonna provide some kind of a group setting for our youngsters which will allow parents to go out for their training, that would be an educational or vocational, to go to work also, which is you know I guess one of the major factors here. Well, we have really gotten into this interim program now and tried to pour some money into their facilities and I think we are at a point now where we can say with some certainty that within a year from this particular point in time we should be able to clear up all of the violations that exist on those facilities and and make them as good facility-wise as we possibly can, given the limitations of...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:21:12.202
Now these facilities will be their facilities. They will not yet city money to actually run the program or it has in some way or have in some way you've been able to get them into the program with regular city funding?

Bob Davis 00:21:26.720
Oh, yes, yes we have provided public funding for these centers.

Speaker 8 00:21:30.040
In other words, you've taken what is there and help them to meet whatever standards are necessary to qualify for these federal and city funding?

Bob Davis 00:21:38.660
Yeah, we've been hampered somewhat because we didn't get the training moneys that we anticipated getting in the '73, '74 budget. Of course, you know, there are two aspects to this. One ,of course, is the facility. And, secondly, as to the staffing qualifications which provides for the license when you look at the program. And many of these parents did not have, you know, the kind of training that is required by law to operate a child care facility. And, of course, our first effort was to get in there and try and get them enrolled into some high school equivalency diploma courses sequences or get them in college, if that was what was needed. But we have had one hand tied behind our backs because we did not have the kinds of moneys to provide to the various centers personnel's to to get the training they needed. So that's one aspect that we're still trying to shake loose. And, of course, it's going to continue to be a problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:22:35.960
Well, as assistant commissioner you're responsible for the facilities and I imagine there must be another person assistant commissioner who is responsible for training and program.

Bob Davis 00:22:46.461
Yes, that's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:22:47.121
Which would then raise sort of an interesting question. I'm sure some of the listeners might be thinking this: why do you have to have special training to take care of your children particularly when these are parents? Isn't everyone qualified to take care of children. What about that?

Bob Davis 00:23:04.251
Well...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:23:04.661
That's said partially tongue-in-cheek but, on the other hand, it is a question that many people ask: why do you have to have fancy educational qualifications to take care of kids?

Bob Davis 00:23:12.360
Well, Dr. Brown we have raised the same question in public education. Why why does a teacher have to have a B.A. degree in order to teach school? And I think it's the same kind of thinking that that we have and the entire public education sector that in order to teach children, whether they're preschool youngsters or in grammar school or high school or college or whatever, you must bring some kind of credentials to those jobs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:23:41.490
Now I noticed you used "credentials" this time in stating it and previously you used "training." The implication, of course, is that in getting credentials you get some training of some skills as to how to function. And now particularly as we talk about accountability in education, we're talking many times more about what people do rather than what their paper certificates say they can do. What are for example some of the things you focus on in the agency or in the various training programs that you want people working with children in these centers to be able to do? You know, as I'm taking the turn away from recognizing the legalities that you have to have a high school diploma or a college diploma, what have you, but what is the end here? What is the skill that you want? The type of skills you want these folk to be able to have when they work with children.

Bob Davis 00:24:34.280
Well, I know basically to be able to to communicate with youngsters to provide them with the kind of training that they need in order to grow up to be healthy citizens in this society, to give them the educational tools that they need in order to successfully compete in this society. Of course, you know I don't have any solutions as to the credentials versus the training that's a continuing question. Many of education...educators have looked at that problem and up to this point we haven't got anything out of it that I could at this point in time say that I agree with or disagree with. There is a committee that's been studying this problem, I guess, for the last year and a half and their recommendations are still forthcoming. It's an interesting question. It's something that now I think a great deal of research needs to be done in For us to come up with something that makes sense I think that we are bound here about tradition because we've always done it this way. Of course we proceed with the understanding that this is the way it should be. And I think what we're going to have to do is to step back now and reassess some of those ideals that we've held almost being sacrosanct and take them upon, you know, break them loose look at them and come up with something maybe a little more realistic and a little more practical given you know today's needs like the children of today need something a little different.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:26:10.470
Well, let's just take that. I was thinking about as you were talking a number of parents and even teachers feel that the best thing for kids to do is to be quiet almost to be seen and not heard. Yet, when you go into a well-run daycare center you see a lot of activity kids moving around furniture moving around etc. Yet some of the people who run the centers both trained and untrained don't like this. They get upset about this as they will kids should be neat and so on. Now or does your agency have any general philosophy about giving children attempt to develop themselves for a variety of things as against more or less just keeping quiet and keeping them well-fed and well- rested? Precisely. We would have great problems if we went into one of our childcare centres and and noticed that the kids were being treated in that fashion the fashion of, you know, you be quiet and you sit there all day that really becomes custodial care. The child is not profiting. He's not learning anything as a result of sitting there and not raising any questions on and out of course our emphasis is to get in there and to see at least my whole focus has been you know when I look at a child care program to see the excitement that's generated by youngsters participating with one another and not a loose setting but one set which says that the child can be free in expressing his or her opinion about issues or problems. And I love to hear a youngsters say, Well, why?" And he presses you right down the end ...[crosstallk]That's very interesting because as you were talking I was thinking of the excitement that you as the Assistant Commissioner bring to this agency and that is the kind of thing that we like to hear about on "Soul of Reason" and it gives us some hope in dealing with the many social problems that we in the black community face. I'd like to thank Bob Davis, Assistant Commissioner of the agency for child development for being our guest on tonight soul of reason.

Bob Davis 00:28:07.501
