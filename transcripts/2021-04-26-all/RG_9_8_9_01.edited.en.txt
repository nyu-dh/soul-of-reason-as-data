Speaker 1 00:00:02.430
How does a black singer composer combine the popular and the classical in Black music.  Here Emmy Kemp singer composer discuss this on tonight's Soul of Reason.  This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 2 00:00:39.410
Soul of Reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.  Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.  With us tonight as our guest is Emmy Kemp.

Speaker 1 00:01:03.470
Well-known singer composer pianist and lady about the arts.  Glad to have you with us tonight.  I mean I'm happy to be here.  Dr. Brown.  Well tell us a little something about what we were mentioning in our tease that is the combining of the classical and the popular.  You have classical training from Northwestern Chicago conservatory.  Are you seeing in six languages you do rock Western folk and about 10 other forms of the arts and music.  Now how do you combine that.  So what do what lead you into this.  What makes Emmy camp the type of all purpose performer that she is.

Speaker 3 00:01:42.080
Well my basic desire to reach all people leads me into doing a number of things.  And where is music of any kind can bridge all kinds of gaps.  Generation language ratio.  What have you.  I still find that when you can communicate with people in whatever their musical language is that you're just a little step ahead.

Speaker 4 00:02:08.389.99999999998545
Now going back to your early education your childhood and so on.

Speaker 1 00:02:13.250
Undoubtedly you must have had some figure some force in your life that led you into northwestern led you into the conservatory to focus on certain forms of musical art.  You you didn't come up through the Kansas City blues circuit I believe.  Now there must be a reason for that other than just the fact that you happen to be living in Chicago.

Speaker 5 00:02:36.500
I haven't defined a straight to it path that I followed.

Speaker 6 00:02:44.480
Things just sort of happen.  For example things never just.  I didn't know at three years old that I was going to make my living in music.  I probably didn't have any conscious thought other than to make that instrument which I probably didn't even know was a piano at the time and make it make a sound for me as I had heard my brother making went astray.  That's what I heard your brother making that every time we talk.

Speaker 1 00:03:10.640
Who are that artists are performers always some person either in the family or so close to the family that leads the song.  I remember talking with Stanley Kowal one of the young B.A..  And he told us about the time Fats Waller came to his house.

Speaker 7 00:03:24.050
You know it's always something that relates to this.

Speaker 8 00:03:27.200
Well there was always music in our home.  I didn't think about it being there or whether or not it wasn't there because it was it was always there and I can recall that Sundays were always my favorite day because on Sundays people could get to where we live which happened to be quite a distance south.  I lived one hundred and ten South and that's in Chicago.  Yes in Chicago which is where I was born and there was a pianist called Bud Scott who's long dead and gone who was from Griffin Georgia and who played in what they call sporting houses.  My grandmother called the sport and as I didn't know at that time either way the sport now has a house of ill repute.

Speaker 6 00:04:08.810
But he probably played for Sunday school when he was younger before he got to the sport now.  So they haven't played in Sunday school.  Well that's right.

Speaker 8 00:04:16.760
And he probably or possibly also as you say Jelly Roll Morton did heard music so-called classical music in the European vein played and performed as he would perhaps walk past some concert hall.  So in those days they didn't have radios but the influences are not that easily pinpointed all the time now.

Speaker 9 00:04:44.480
So many people in talking about black music play that like music stems from the church stems from our heritage from slavery our attempt to throw off the yoke or attempt to communicate and they say that it's somewhat odd or somewhat not completely in character that black people would turn to the classical to develop their musical expertise et cetera.

Speaker 10 00:05:13.070
How do you relate to that because I know you cover the whole range from soul to Bach.

Speaker 11 00:05:18.920
I feel that at a particular time in this country and it's not totally erased now there was the idea that music or other forms of art in order to be worthwhile had to be European in order to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately many black people had this particular idea in order to compete.

Speaker 8 00:05:44.180
However in society for say jobs in whatever they might be we had to try to prepare ourselves.  Preparedness is of course very important.  The only thing is if you are rejecting what is yours with the thought that what you have is not good enough.  This is a little bit of a mistake.

Speaker 11 00:06:05.060
American people in general white people specifically still very often have the idea that what is European is to be emulated rather than what is to be American.

Speaker 4 00:06:20.030
And of course the true American art form probably the only major American contribution to the arts is black music.  Well this is what all raising and that's really part of our heritage.  But one thing that I've noticed in talking with many musicians is the fact that more and more increasingly practically every musician is technically trained that whereas his his or her mode may not be the classical.  They do have a technical training and for example I guess your training began very very young and probably continues almost to this day.

Speaker 12 00:06:52.280
It continues intermittently when I can afford to go back to school.

Speaker 6 00:06:55.790
That's a very okay.  I was down at NYU about a year and a half ago.

Speaker 9 00:07:01.540
Is that right now as a performer who does so many things and so many things well you sing compose you play the piano as I said you do Western and you do rock.  You do spirituals cetera.  You're in clubs you're in concerts you're at colleges.  One thing that I would find interesting is finding out how you approach performing in these different middle years because I imagine performing before a college audience is a little different.  And performing before where you are at the St. Regis in the quiet cocktail room or in a large concert hall let's say town hall I wait.  Yeah I imagine you'd find it different and since you've done it I'd be interested in hearing and I'm sure our audience would be interested in hearing just how you approach this in a different fashion these various kinds of places say lounges in concert halls and maybe outdoor parks too.

Speaker 8 00:08:03.360
And there are so many this there are so many areas that you can perform in.  They are different in a lounge for example or where alcohol is normally served.  One has to take into consideration usually that though people came to hear you that may not have been their primary purpose.  It depends on what the lounge is and where it is.  Certain times of day also are murder for performance.

Speaker 11 00:08:34.909.9999999999418
The businessman is going to discuss with the gentleman that he is perhaps romancing for that big contract big guy right.

Speaker 7 00:08:47.670
You've mentioned gentleman the other way is now in our society where there are women executives too.

Speaker 12 00:08:53.480
Yes women may be romancing other women clients or other men clients or it can be very mixed up.  It is taking a day at a time.  I won't say who is doing it to whom but the purpose that I'm speaking of is money business.

Speaker 5 00:09:12.830
If it happens to be that sort of place a performer doesn't necessarily expect to have total attention.  He can hope and I have hope to do many business conversations that they would keep quiet.

Speaker 9 00:09:25.580
Well that's interesting because I having gone to business lunches I've had that experience and sometimes you do say Gee I wish they the singer or the performer would be a little bit more quiet because we want to get on with our business.  On the other hand looking at it and empathizing with your position as a performer I imagine it takes a certain amount of ego depression to be able to go through that because as a performer all of us want to receive acclaim recognition attention and when you enter some of these lounges at certain times.

Speaker 1 00:09:56.720
Now you mentioned the lunchtime now.  I imagine as a transition as you go from lunch and software into evening time where the real lovers out.

Speaker 6 00:10:05.510
It could quiet up but it also could get very rambunctious.  For example.  They may have been there since noon you see discussing Oh.  They may have gone gone through the air.  I have to do it schedule far into the night.

Speaker 12 00:10:20.000
And the thing is well they have been very good customers in the daytime.  This is from the business approach and what perhaps a real manager is thinking.  Not from an artistic standpoint of the performer.  He wonders well how can be true or respect the performer and also the person who is talking because that's what he came specifically to do.  I think in life in general we have a lot of things to compromise to.  And this is one of them.  The performance level that one maintains no matter what.

Speaker 4 00:10:56.500
Now I do notice that you are going to be in North Carolina at several colleges in early April.

Speaker 10 00:11:02.620
Yes and I was just wondering what type of programs you developed for colleges.  How responsive are these audiences.  How different are these presentations and these performances than those that you are doing.

Speaker 11 00:11:18.680
The New York area and some of our clubs I feel that in college performance as far as I go I would like to do music and in some cases do dialogue that will titillate thought that will open their minds to perhaps going and finding out various things for themselves and that's interesting.

Speaker 4 00:11:47.830
How would you do that with music.  I think it's a very good point.  For example in the language things they may not have thought about where in particular Lumumba was but if you sing Lumumba.

Speaker 5 00:12:03.010
And you explain what this is about and where it was conceived and why they might think well maybe I'll go over there and check this place out.  If you do something say from Brazil in Portuguese they might be able to relate back to a film that came out recently and not too long ago which was called Black Orpheus which was based on one of the Chronicles.  Yes but which was based on one of the classic myths.  So there are a lot of inter relations that can come to mind just by introducing a particular kind of song that's interesting you really see yourself as an educator as well as an artist.

Speaker 13 00:12:52.150
Of course I guess in many ways educators artists because they help helping to mold the mind and the soul but in particular in a positive way in a positive way particularly what you're saying is that when you develop your college presentations you really try to get a breadth of numbers and a breadth of repertoire that introduces the college audience to a variety of things now.  I notice that you've performed at black colleges and white colleges.  Do you find any significant difference in response to your music.  Do you change your music.  For example when you perform at black colleges as contrasted with white colleges to some extent I do not that much really.

Speaker 5 00:13:37.120
Also when the performance was has made a difference for example in this country during the 60s there were certain things perhaps that a black audience would not want to hear.  For example they might not have necessarily wanted to hear much Chopin.  Is that really true.  If however it was something that they could relate to.  Word wise if for example I began playing the fantasy impromptu by Chopin which from which the melody I'm always chasing rainbows came from and I sing that when I come to that particular part of the melody.  This is maybe a little bit giving them some relation to what is happening to them.  This of course didn't just not become good after the 60s this is going on probably for the rest of your life because in a sense I think man is chasing rainbows and whether he manages to capture them is very much up to him regardless of how many other forces against the success in capturing a rainbow.

Speaker 13 00:14:46.630
Is that a good explanation.

Speaker 9 00:14:48.910
It's interesting though that you mention that in the 60s in the time of the height of the civil rights revolt the revolution we might call it that you felt that black audiences did not want to relate to certain European composers.

Speaker 5 00:15:03.880
I might have I'm using that as a particular example it's a good example at certain times they might not have wanted to hear anything as bland what they would consider bland as Abraham Martin and John.

Speaker 14 00:15:17.890
Now why why would you say that's bland.

Speaker 13 00:15:19.960
That's very unsettling because I'd consider as bland because that does have some moral I must admit that I probably would consider it more bland than some of the other things that we deal with coming out of our black music but still you're saying that the social circumstances that surround your performance in a sense dictate some of the things you might include in the performance.

Speaker 5 00:15:44.620
For example young gifted and black in the 60s was something that was included in some of my performances.

Speaker 15 00:15:50.710
That's the Lorraine Hansberry because this was a little bit closer to many I'm speaking of the selection that Nina Simone Laurie another writer did say it loud I'm black and I'm proud.  That particular slogan.  And that was one particular tune that James Brown who is tabbed number one so no I don't know all the.

Speaker 9 00:16:15.580
Labels are hard but people make their labels and I think Brother Brown can do pretty well for himself.

Speaker 5 00:16:21.730
Well I think a lot of times the labels are created by totally commercial creators.

Speaker 14 00:16:27.880
Oh well that's true.  You know it is not necessarily quite the thing either.

Speaker 1 00:16:31.720
When you say somebody is number one unless there's an actual counting that necessarily mean that.  But it does have it's an appellation to name it says this particular person's artistry is respected.  Well the thing about it is it Dr. Roscoe Brown may be soulful in the sense that is really meaningful and will perhaps last beyond James Brown in the next two centuries and be really and in fact.

Speaker 14 00:16:57.010
Soul brother.  That's why we call the sole reason and our guest on tonight solar reason is Emmy kill camp.

Speaker 7 00:17:03.640
Popular singer composer lady about the odds and we've been going through and I can see as we talk with Emmy a certain amount of I call it ambiguity in terms of your own artistic development.

Speaker 10 00:17:18.160.00000000011642
On one hand you really are almost completely into soul and black music on the other hand you have this pull from the European and the classical and it's interesting as I read your liner notes from your program notes and so on the many many different things you do and I'm inclined to this point to ask you how do you keep the straight.

Speaker 7 00:17:39.970
How do you decide when you're going to be Emmet Kemp the classicist and how do you decide you're going to be Emma Kemp the soul sex assistant.  I'd say that my music does not make me any more soulful.

Speaker 14 00:17:51.520
Or any less.

Speaker 16 00:17:52.050
So we also feel we know that the basic thing is how I think my reasoning that is the soul of reason.

Speaker 15 00:18:02.900
How I think for example there was a period to which may not be totally past when people were black people were Kateri categorized by their own people as to who had this this and this much so their particular experiences were not known to the other people who were doing all this labeling and categorizing.  And if it were really broken down as to what I say I have been through.  Or another soul sister has been through those who were doing all this labeling and categorizing may not have been through any place nearly as much as far as the black experience goes.  But there is not time nor opportunity to say as in a contest.  Well I went through so and so as far as saying you have to live in a so so-called ghetto to be soulful and somebodies terms.  I don't buy this at all.  There are people who always knew who they were even though they lived with a green plot outside their door even though they lived in a so-called suburb and sometimes they knew even better who they were because of the way in which they were rejected in that very same suburb.

Speaker 7 00:19:25.670
That has happened to so many black people in so many places.

Speaker 10 00:19:28.670
Which brings me to the question which I frequently asked artists musicians have things really gotten better for the black artist or is it like it is in athletics that they've gotten better for the superstars but for the average athlete they really haven't gotten any better.  Possibly even a little worse.  Have things gotten better for the black musician or the black singer.

Speaker 5 00:19:57.260
I think that it depends on what kind of singing the black singer is doing.

Speaker 17 00:20:03.050
There again we go with categories now the people who hold the purse strings as far as promoting a black singer say such as a soul singer such as Aretha Franklin.  They have decided I feel that soul will be the category in which a black singer will normally do to perform and prevail and usually their rewards.  Roberta Flack was considered in a sense a soul singer.  In a sense she bridges categories also and it is the unique charisma of her personality and the guidance of those other than I feel friends who have only commercial interests at heart that have helped.

Speaker 18 00:20:57.830
Roberta Flack to prevail.  Roberto open classical music background.  I believe from Howard University Yes.  And to open the way for other people who have.

Speaker 15 00:21:09.290
Other diversification in their backgrounds.  I won't say that it's necessarily a fight.  There was a word in particular that you use their influence.

Speaker 6 00:21:18.890
It wasn't inconsistencies conflict simply is something I am doing and I feel I am.

Speaker 12 00:21:24.980
I don't think that different kinds of training or different kinds of exposures to things would mean that a person's basic thrust and their basic foundation would be on an ambiguous level.

Speaker 1 00:21:41.060
It would only mean that they can function and more and on more levels that's really an interesting point of view because it is true that blacks in music in particular are categorized.

Speaker 7 00:21:54.890
I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up one day and found a Charley Pride is the number one country in western singer and he's as black as you like.  And then we find of course in the classical field of opera for example I think Leontyne Price has been the prima donna in so many productions at the Met Grace Bunbury.

Speaker 13 00:22:24.680
Walter Dobbs many many George Shirley blacks moving into this.  And of course as we talk about our blackness and we begin to try to establish our own identity.  Many times we do get this conflict between by going into the European and the Western music world.  Are we in fact rejecting our blackness on the other hand I've heard it said and talking about Latinos work in particular that she brings a certain kind of soul to the opera that no white singer could or has brought to date.

Speaker 18 00:22:59.300
I think for we are over the particular diversity to it.  The worst part of it anyway between so-called classical music and other kinds of a black American is I think that I think the worst part.

Speaker 1 00:23:16.230
I really wonder about that because so much of our modern music comes out of our black experience moving into our commercials.  It's moving into our background music for airplanes for hotels.  What have you.  And I think it's I think it's our music.  It moves me and removes you.  It moves people.

Speaker 19 00:23:39.520
And when you say the conflict is over I think that much of this development really heightens the conflict so much so that I think even in some of the classical fields they are beginning to incorporate some of the Jazz or the soul idioms.

Speaker 14 00:23:56.740
Well that had been done many years.  It has many many years but it is for about Gershwin folks have fun.

Speaker 11 00:24:02.750
Yes going to the idea of what blacks think of themselves.

Speaker 15 00:24:07.270
What I'm saying is I think that it's important what the man thinks of himself not what has been defined for him.  This is what I'm getting.

Speaker 19 00:24:15.610
That's what the black revolution really is all about black defining for themselves.

Speaker 20 00:24:19.900
Yes.

Speaker 11 00:24:20.620
When the Symphony of the new world can for example have an orchestra a symphony orchestra playing the music of a Randy Weston who is presenting it seems undeniably black music all the way back from North Africa which is I understand where he lives now when they can have Duke Ellington who they nobody can erase nor categorize.  He certainly engulfs and goes across any kind of barriers although he is very much accepted and worshiped and respected by white musical America and the white music world.  Black people from every place couldn't reject him.  So when you have the element of Ellington and Randy Weston joining with the Symphony of the new Europe a new world which is an interracial I believe yes organization.

Speaker 18 00:25:21.070
It's very difficult to hold to your old prejudices and these are exactly what they are.  It's very difficult to hold to a black musical bigotry.

Speaker 13 00:25:33.760
Well after that there was really quite a treatise on black music.  It is all provoking in a sense because it says to me and I'm sure it says to our audience that some of the things that we have so rigidly categorize need to break out of some of these categories.  Now one of the things you've done within the past year which I find very significant is a tribute to the WC Handy on his one hundredth birthday.

Speaker 10 00:26:03.550
And we do call possibly not always correctly but we do call the WC Handy the father the blues the powerful he is the one who brought it into fruition at least with his blues.  Yes.  And what we for even what real response did you get to that.

Speaker 11 00:26:20.860
Well I got great response and of course there has been response all over the country and all over the world as one thing leads to another.  Or as people have looked at their calendars and discovered that my goodness 1973 how many black heroes in music can you point to and say oh there goes one hundred years I think that the significant thing to do with a figure such as WC Handy since you do have that one hundred years and since the bicentennial of the country is coming up is to file your own information and so of fun to it can be entertaining sort of relate back in your own family what was so-and-so doing in 17 78 because many black people have trace themselves back even further that just so happens however that Mr. Hanley's great grandfather was up in the big house as they called it.

Speaker 15 00:27:26.020
He was just being born and when he got a little bit older he noticed that his master was reading.  So he said I'm going to learn to read.

Speaker 19 00:27:36.010
I'll do it myself and you have taught us an awful lot on tonight.  So the reason we've been visiting with Emmy camp singer composer who is talk with us about the many many roots of black music and how black music and classical music are integrated in various forms of the black musical experience.  Thanks for being our guest on tonight soul of reason.  It was a very great pleasure.
