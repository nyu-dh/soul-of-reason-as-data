May 22nd 1974 was the 20th anniversary of the publication of John Killens' historic novel "Youngblood." Hear John Killens discuss Black writing today and yesterday on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:36.521
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:02.861
The month of May in 1974 was historic in many ways. On one hand, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Brown case decision that led to the--at least legal--elimination of racial segregation in the public schools. And on the other case, in the world of literature, May 22nd 1974 represented the 20th anniversary of the publication of a novel by a great Black novelist who is our guest tonight: John Killens. I'm glad to have you with us tonight on "Soul of Reason," John.

John Killens 00:01:33.641
It's always good to be on the program with you, Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:36.191
Well let's talk about really what has happened in those 20 years. What has happened to John Collins what has happened to Black writing and what in a sense has happened to Black people in general.

John Killens 00:01:47.501
Well I think a lot of things have happened but the fresh air we're seeing the more things change the more they remain the same. And that's almost the way I see it. I think the most important thing is that Black people have began to move. Not so much that the establishment has relented in its persecution of Black people. Black people have began to move. In the 60s into the 50s and the 60s. In 1955 or 56 I think it was when this little Black woman in Alabama says she was tired.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:23.413
Tired of standing up.

John Killens 00:02:24.611
That's right. I mean I think that literally metaphorically she meant she was tired, and so tired of the whole damn thing and that set off a chain reaction and moved towards the whole Civil Rights movement, towards the Black Power movement, towards the sit ins, freedom rides, et cetera. Black people were in motion. That was most important thing these last 20 years. I think much of the literature reflected that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:51.280
Now "Youngblood," when it came out, received a variety of critical acclaim, some saying it was too angry some saying it didn't really represent the world the way it really is and of course we know if anything it might have been an understatement of the way the world really is. And the thing that you, John Killens, have done is to sort of set a standard for literary expression of Black people and through your teaching as well as through your various lectures et cetera. You have communicated to Black people who want to write all over this country some of the things about our experience and writing about our experience, which then leads me to say or to ask what has happened since this period of the late 60s where probably more Black writing, more Black poetry, more Black short stories were published than in any period in history. What really has happened to Black writing? Has it become more strident? Has it become less strident? Has become better? Or has the quality been attenuated by the fact that there's so many Black people writing now?

John Killens 00:04:00.190
Well I think that the writing has become more mature in many cases. I think that reflects the maturity of Black people. Sometimes it's not as strident, but I don't think a strident strategy necessarily means a revolutionary, you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:17.921
That's a very good point.

John Killens 00:04:19.031
I think we've confused ourselves by thinking that the more you write and scream and shout it the more revolutionary he was. In my class at Howard University, at the first class I tell my students it should be clear that the rap revolution is over.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:36.541
Well very good way of putting: the rap revolution is over.

John Killens 00:04:39.521
It's over you know and that now we are settled down to work and that's what Douglass meant when he said, "Without struggle there is no progress."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:48.580
And of course the thing that's so interesting is that in the first days of the real strident period, '65, '66, '67, in a sense it was a cry out of Black people both to relieve some of the agony but also to cry out to white people and say, "Look we really are mad about this and you don't listen to us when we talk in simple language. So we going to talk to you in a way that you just can't help but listen to us." And now, even though the system hasn't really changed very much, it is true that significantly larger numbers of white people, politicians, corporate executives, are listening. Whether they are listening to the extent of doing anything, at least they're listening. No longer will you get turned off. Which then means that what you write about and what you speak about and the way you write it has to get on a communications line where at least people can understand what you're coming from other than just the anger and the anguish of your experience.

John Killens 00:05:44.431
Yes I think we moved from demonstrating in the streets to a political level at this time. You see the many election of Blacks to the legislatures, the mayors of various cities. I think the most significant election was in Detroit ,Michigan.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:01.251
That's right.

00:06:01.821
Where a Black ex-labor leader became mayor of Detroit, Michigan. That's the center of this country's power.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:10.160
And interestingly enough on a relatively moderate platform.

John Killens 00:06:13.641
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:14.060
He did speak against police abuse and brutality and so on. But basically his platform was reasonably moderate. And whereas Detroit does have a large number of Blacks, it did require a significant number of white votes to get elected which does mean that there is some political maturity at least both among Black people and among some white people. But now how is this change, this reflectiveness, this analysis, this more mature revolution being reflected in the themes of Black writing? Because as we look at the late 60s many of the themes were burn baby burn or burn whitey or dealing with the exorcism that Black people went through looking at their slave experience or ghetto experience. What are some of the themes now that are emerging?

John Killens 00:07:05.780
Well I could see one theme. A very powerful poem that was written by Mary Evans. I don't know if you know poem. It says, "Speak the truth to the people."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:17.330
Yes I know the poem.

John Killens 00:07:18.301
That's a powerful, beautiful as far as I'm concerned revolutionary poem because it says, "Cut out the nonsense and speak the truth to the people. The truth will set people free."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:28.780
And of course one of the problems is, it's with the complexities of the racism and the elitism in our society. The question is what really is the truth. For example, in the late 60s in particular, there was a heavy stream of Black nationalism. That things that would work if they were controlled completely and only by Blacks. Whereas some of the writing now is beginning to reach out into the Third World type of coalitions or coalitions across class lines and things of this type. Now as you look at the works that are coming out, remembering that a good amount of the writing in the late 60s was poetry, I get the impression that now we're getting more short stories and more novels. And of course some of the great plays by some of our great young Black playwrights. So how do you see this? Is this being reflected in this way?

John Killens 00:08:29.630
Yeah well I think, I hope you're right about that the novel is coming into its own because I've heard a friend of mine say at the symposium at Columbia that the novel was dying. But people, establishment people have been pronouncing the death of the novel for a hell of a long time and the novel seems to be still in good shape. And I think it has a long life. I hope so because that's my primary interest, in the novel. I think the novel is the freest form of expression and in the novel you have an opportunity to see people develop and grow and you have an opportunity also to explore the complexities of the society in which we live. And I think that is very difficult to capture in a poem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:21.061
See it's interesting. You said the novel is probably most effective way of expression. And as you were saying, as I was saying it's also the hardest thing to write.

John Killens 00:09:28.221
Well it's not easy.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:28.224
It might well be that the explosion of poetry is as easy, relatively easy that is, to sit down and dash off a poem of your feelings. And even fairly easy to put together a pretty good short story, a little bit more difficult a television script. When you get into films dash novels, and I know you've done some work in writing film scripts and my own personal experience gets into that area too. That really is a toughie because you're trying to pull together this character development which you do in words in a novel, and you're doing it in a combination of words and action in a film.

John Killens 00:10:07.431
Pictures.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:08.061
And that, filmmaking is a particular area of expertise. I think it does in a sense transcend the novel in some ways. But speaking of your own work recently, past three years I guess it is. You wrote a novel which was almost autobiographical of many Black people, "The Cotillion," which got a tremendous play. And I understand that you were working on a musical version of that. What really has happened with that project? In retrospect, what were some of the reactions to this? Because this looked at another theme and I think it's beginning to come through Black writing, is it we're looking at ourselves as families as people. We are not necessarily looking at ourselves always in juxtaposition to whites or in juxtaposition to our present position vis-à-vis whites.

John Killens 00:11:00.610
Well it's always been my contention that Black people needed first to deal with themselves. As Don Lee said, when integration, we need to integrate with each other, you know, in the first instance before we worry about integrating with the larger white society. And beginning with "Youngblood." "Youngblood" was about a Black family in the Deep South. Of course you had to put them in the context of this white hostile society in which they lived where they were fighting for their dignity. But most, and "Sippi" was a family novel. I've always been interested in the Black family because I think that's the focal point of the Black nation, if you will. And don't I think Black nationhood contradicts an identification with the so-called Third World, which I prefer to call the First World. I can't see why we should give ourselves [unintelligible] to the third class citizenship in the world, you know. We gonna find a new name for ourselves.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:02.651
I concur with that.

John Killens 00:12:02.656
I would say, I think we're the First World people since even the most racist anthropologists admit that man first stood on his two feet in Africa and certainly some of the oldest civilization came from Asia.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:17.252
That's right.

John Killens 00:12:17.851
And this is the place

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:18.460
[unintelligible] That's where

John Killens 00:12:18.463
it started. That's where it started. So that, I call them the First World people. I know who you're talking about and I don't think Black nationalism conflicts with the whole idea of First World people. Last summer I spent three weeks in China. I don't know if you knew that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:38.051
No I wasn't aware of that.

John Killens 00:12:38.892
Tremendous experience, you know, among those First World people. We traveled through about 7 or 8 Chinese cities, you know. I found that 3 of my books had been published there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:52.100
That's very interesting

John Killens 00:12:52.105
Including "Youngblood" and "Thunder" and "Black Man's Burden," you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:55.542
That's gratifying and interesting.

John Killens 00:12:58.391
It is.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:58.901
And of course since those people have been going through a struggle too against imperialism and oppression. There's much to identify in those common experiences. But again as we extend this in terms of the reaction to a novel I can tell you some people have said, "Well maybe it's a little frivolous for us to think about things like this." On the other hand it might be suggested that this is part of our reality and if we don't look at our reality and understand what it means and even get some humor out of it, because I found personally "Cotillion" to be a fantastically humorous book because I literally in a sense knew people or I know people who reflect that particular experience.

John Killens 00:13:44.120
Yeah I've had people tell me they were sitting on the bus and people take them to Bellevue because they were laughing and laughing.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:52.961
I had about the same experience

John Killens 00:13:55.001
I had a good time with the book, you know. I think that one of the things that has helped us to survive in this hostile country is our ability to laugh. This can be a revolutionary weapon, to laugh. Langston Hughes called it laughing just to keep from crying, you know. And humor has always been and can be a lethal weapon against oppression. George Bernard Shaw was a humorist but he was a tremendous indicter of the society.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:29.170
It's interesting as you mentioned that I was just thinking about it another form of humor, namely satire. Actually, as I reflect on black writing, we really haven't done that much in the way of satire. Probably one thing that comes to mind is Doug Ward's "Day of Absence." That's a form of satire.

John Killens 00:14:52.201
Chester Himes has done some stuff too.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:53.432
Yeah. I was thinking, as I was reviewing it my mind. He's done something with that. Is that a function of possibly, "I was just being so angry" or is it a function of the fact that we really feel that we have to say it in more explicit terms?

John Killens 00:15:10.930
Well I think it reflects the fact that we felt the need to scream at white people. But I think after a while it upset white people for a while. That's why people got bored.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:25.460
That's right. They don't even listen to you.

John Killens 00:15:27.020
Yeah. So what else is new? You know. So that the thing that, the reason that I wrote a book like "Cotillion," although it was time for us to look at ourselves and look at our own middle class foibles, because most Black people had bought the whole American dream, the whole thing and bought it just as much as middle class white people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:52.420
As a matter of fact the market research indicated that Black people in general tend to use more of the name brand brands of various products than white people.

John Killens 00:16:03.530
Very name brand conscious.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:04.761
Because of the identification, the brand identifies with them with the mainstream society. Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with John Killens, the famous novelist and we're reflecting on Black writing spanning a period from his book "Younglood," which was published in May of 1954, right to the present. And one of the things I want to ask you John tonight is what are some of your contemporary projects? What are some of the things that you are working on now or thinking about getting into?

John Killens 00:16:36.142
Well as you pointed out I just completed adaptation of the novel "Cotillion" for a Broadway musical and Smokey Robinson and Willie Hutch are doing the music.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:46.411
That's fantastic.

John Killens 00:16:48.131
We expect to go on the road sometime in the fall and probably come into New York beginning of the winter, maybe in January. It looks like a good project.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:57.860
You know we have talked on "Soul of Reason" with many people in Black theater about some of the problems are getting financial support from the Black community for various plays and musicals relating to the Black experience. What has been your experience in regard to getting the "Cotillion" together, the musical?

John Killens 00:17:16.880.0000000001164
Well, we had a lot of problems but at the present time it looks like the back end is coming from Motown, Berry Gordy and who seems to have quite a bit of money, you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:27.681
And also it's a good tie in because the record and the musical output that [unintelligible]

John Killens 00:17:33.930
Smokey is vice president of Motown, you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:36.132
Sometimes they call him the poet, the musical poet of the Black experience because of the many songs that he's written.

John Killens 00:17:43.010
He's a great lyricist and a great musician. He called me the other day and said that he had written some dynamite music. I said, "Man, prove it."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:50.660
Prove it. That's it.

John Killens 00:17:51.861
Let me hear it. Don't be telling me. He said Well in a couple of weeks he's going into the studio and taping and he's going to call me, and flying out and we'll sit down and listen to it. I said, "Okay."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:02.272
Well that really is a test in the field of the arts. The test is the work you produce right

John Killens 00:18:06.502
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:06.505
And what you say about it.

John Killens 00:18:07.610
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:07.881
You can talk about it afterwards but until it's done you

John Killens 00:18:11.010
And when you write a musical, see you have to put the two things together. You don't even have a musical play unless you get, until you get the music. I've done the adaptation. I had to cut from 150 pages to 85 pages because of demand of theater and the musical. It was tough job but I did it. But I want to talk about a couple of other things which disturbed me. The trend of the writing. I was looking at a book the other day. A so-called progressive liberal white man is talking about Crispus Attucks, talking about the school. He said, "This nigger school out in Jersey called Crispus Attucks." And he said it easily, you know, as if he had the right to say it and that he didn't expect anybody to challenge him. And I think we have, we have contributed to that. In the 60s without having an historic, sense of historic continuity, we heard the word "nigger" spoken by Black people [unintelligible] so-called militants, you know. And always rejected it because I think the word "nigger" has been the pretense and the use made of the word to justify the enslavement and the colonized most of the world everywhere Western man when he forged men into niggers.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:30.330
Yeah it's a derogatory term, a derogatory concept as matter of fact there've even been books written about the student as a nigger or the woman as a nigger. It's a derogatory concept in that sense. On the other hand I guess what might be suggested is that in the family as it were one can call oneself that. I personally have some some problems with that because on the other hand having lived in the Black community this is something that one does to oneself. But the question that I think you're raising is whether or not this is something that we should throw out to the world and certainly whether we should accept it when it is used by white people as well as by some Black people [crosstalk].

John Killens 00:20:11.032
I'm raising the question of whether we should use it all.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:13.531
To to each other.

John Killens 00:20:14.391
Among ourselves. It's not done in my house. My kids were not used to it. When my daughter with the Fisk University she came to me one day with, you know, tears in her eyes. She said, "What's the matter with these girls in my dorm [unintelligible]." I said, "What are you talking about?" She said, "The password as a nigger ain't shit."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:33.201
Wow.

John Killens 00:20:35.030
She said, "What does it mean." I said, "It means that a couple of decades have passed since I was on the college campus and the slogan hasn't changed. Not even grammatically," you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:44.040
And of course the feeling behind it is the thing that you're dealing with with [crosstalk].

John Killens 00:20:47.501
It's kind of a debilitating thing that even when we say it affectionately. It means if you hear people say, "Niggers ain't going to get together, niggers ain't going to do this." That's what we say among each other. I think it has defeated us from doing many things that we have to do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:04.860
I think that's an interesting point because many of us in the movement went through the argument about Negro and Black.

John Killens 00:21:12.190
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:12.421
But that really represents a different level of the continuum. Black is a description of the color spectrum that society, in terms of our color system, assigned to us and has become the basis of pride in the fact that Black was supposed be bad and white was supposed to be good. Now you know if white's good, so is Black good.

John Killens 00:21:37.411
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:37.414
And that's a different contexts as regarding, [crosstalk] using the term nigger. Right.

John Killens 00:21:44.011
I use the word Black but I don't fight people who use the word Negro because after all it's the Spanish term for Black and I can't see us preferring the English version to the Spanish version. So you know what's the big deal?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:56.520
Well, eventually it gets into a political [crosstalk].

John Killens 00:21:59.281
They say, "What is Negro? What nation is Negro?" What nation is, I don't know of any country named Black either, you know. But, and Negro is a Spanish term for Black. It's the connotations that are put onto it [crosstalk].

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:12.321
It's the connotations that are put on the term when it comes to political [crosstalk].

John Killens 00:22:15.401
I find no need to clean up the word nigger or to use it. It doesn't ever occur to me to think of a Black person. We were in a panel discussion. I was on a panel discussion with Chinua Achebe and I said that brothers, we got to make up our mind whether we are Achebe's brother or whether we are the white man's definition of us. Achebe is not a nigger. He is a Black man in Africa. That's quite different from being a nigger, you know. And I just, I think this word has kept us from doing a lot of things. It's very, as I said, debilitating in a very subtle way, you know. We don't even know it's happening. And when we say, "Niggers ain't going to do this."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:02.040
Of course you are taking the role of a writer of a novel. You're looking at the meaning of words. And this raises another interesting question, which has been brought up many times dealing with Black writing and some of the so-called modern American white writing. And that is the excessive use of obscenities and profanities. It might be alleged that in writing about Black families if, in fact, they use nigger in their interaction one should use that in one's writing. Similarly, if they use a certain levels of obscenities or profanities despite the popular expression expletive deleted the fact is that this is the way many people talk. How do you respond to this as a writer? I'm not talking about whether you necessarily would use it or not, but how do you respond to this particular argument? Well I would respond to in this way that is the, I see the responsibility of the writer is art should also teach. I don't, I wouldn't tell you that you can look through my novel and won't find the word nigger but you also, it's put in a certain context and the character who uses the word is a cat who is using a villainous tool. And it's very clear that that's not the author talking. It is different when it's, so it's the context in which you put it. It would be cleaning up the South of I would say that white people didn't use the word nigger. In "Cotillion" you'll find Lady Daphne using the word,. She's proclaimed, "But she ain't no African." [crosstalk] Yeah

John Killens 00:24:34.881
But she uses the word "nigger."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:36.071
That's her answer.

John Killens 00:24:36.711
You know. And if you read the book her daughter said, "All right Mom if you want to be a nigger instead of African it's okay with me," you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:46.031
Yeah I recall.

John Killens 00:24:47.101
So it's the way you use it, you know. And the context. No, I wouldn't deny that Black people don't call themselves that but I think it's the responsibility of a writer not only to reflect life but to interpret it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:01.920
You made a telling point earlier you said that art should teach and this is something that I know some painters, some musicians, some playwrights, etc. tend to reject. They say, "Art should reflect the way in which I feel about my interaction with my environment, my experience." And you're taking a position which some novelists in particular take. Namely that art is a form of interpretation and analysis of the society. Some of us even go so far as to say art is the conscience of a society. How do you balance that with this creative drive that causes one to want to express in the graphic art and music and dance or what have you?

John Killens 00:25:53.830
Well first of all I think that there is no such thing as this western myth of art for art's sake. I think that's a myth. There's no basis in fact. I think all art is propaganda although all propaganda is not art. We could differentiate [unintelligible] art, by the same token I don't see any contradiction in the creative act and interpretation. For example, I have been pretty disturbed by the if the flock of movies that have come out recently like "Superfly." [crosstalk] which I thought was a bad ass song, too. But because I think it has changed Black people's image of themselves, you know. You go on 42nd Street, you see Black dudes with the big pimp hats and built in plus their side burns limping down in high heeled slippers, you know, down the avenue, you know. We've been done in by the movie industry and because, and it's done intentionally.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:12.961
And we've helped to do it to ourselves.

John Killens 00:27:14.020
That's right. We subsidized it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:15.761
We helped to do it to ourselves and of course this has to do with the hunger, I think, for Black people to see Black images and it's unfortunate that in seeking for this in some instances the Black images weren't as positive as they might be.

John Killens 00:27:27.910
[unintelligible] is that it illustrates how art can teach us. "Buck and the Preacher." "Buck and the Preacher" entertained. It was funny but it taught history, the history the Exodusters who went West seeking land, you see, without which no nation can be built. It also brought in some African culture where they were discouraging, one moment wanted to turn back and they went to their elders, you know, for advice and the father for advice. It was a beautiful film. This is kind of film I would like to see.
