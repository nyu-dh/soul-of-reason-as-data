Speaker 1 00:00:01.780
This is Soul of reason a program that tells what's happening in black America.

Speaker 2 00:00:06.880
Each week on NBC leaders and movers in the black community visit soul of reason to discuss important issues of concern to black New Yorkers. I am your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. And with us this evening is Kathy Chance who's special assistant for urban affairs at that prestigious institution on Fifth Avenue the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And we're glad to have you with us tonight Kathy. Thank you so much Dr. Brown for talking about that prestigious institution on Fifth Avenue which is probably America's foremost art emporium or gallery or museum whatever you choose to call it.

Speaker 3 00:00:49.450
One of the things that those of us in black have been concerned about is how will this institution that is so important and is located in the sense fairly close to the black community and the Hispanic community is sitting trying to reach out to deal with some of our concerns because art in particular has been seen as sort of an elite primarily white establishment. Some of the so-called classical arts have not been promoted as heavily as they might be in the black community. And similarly the work of black and Afro-American. And African artists has not been shown as much in the museum. So you have a heck of a job I'd have to say.

Speaker 4 00:01:34.960
Well Roscoe let me just say this I'm gonna say Roscoe because I've known you for so long. Dr. Brown certainly I just want to indicate to the Metropolitan Museum of Art has been very much relevant to the black community and has made itself relevant to the black and Hispanic community since 1968 when the Department of Community Programs was first conceived and with the establishment of this unit with n a fine arts institution devoted to the encyclopedic collection of fine art of the world. The museum has developed programs based upon needs and wants in the community not one of the programs we're going to talk about are ever forced upon a community they negotiated and we tried to find a a balance are an area of compromise where we can plan programs which the community might want which they might need and things which we can do considering the limitations are the natural limitations of a museum which is devoted to collecting and acquiring and press preserving. So within that framework in that context it has been a very careful but slow unfortunately process of growth and development in the area of community programming.

Speaker 5 00:02:45.790
One of the things that you mentioned about museums and that has to do with the traditional museum of human engine collecting and preserving. Right. And of course what educational about is learning and appreciating.

Speaker 3 00:02:59.530
And it's true that the purpose of museums to in essence make the great works of art of all types available for people to see and appreciate and understand. But unfortunately because art does have a price it tends to be that the so-called greatest art is in the greatest institutions and because they are very large and elegant and sometimes quite austere. Many times the average citizen white or black tends not to make that foray into the museum. I know that the Met and particularly in the leadership of Tom Hoving has taken great steps.

Speaker 5 00:03:40.710
And I think museums all over the country. The thing that I noticed as I was driving off that avenue the other day is the big banner you know the Metro Charlotte right beautiful. And I've been in other cities in the country recently most notably San Francisco and Dallas Texas. And again you see these banners right promoting art and even in Washington D.C. as they say as New York goes so goes the nation.

Speaker 6 00:04:04.460
The same can be said for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Whatever we do whether museums tend to to pick up and to follow changing of course the style and pattern to fit their own communities. But I'd like to indicate that the Department of Community Programs and the Department of Urban Affairs very definitely basis each of its programs on the collections and the outreach efforts which are made within that context bring people into the museum to bring about a confrontation with great art as well as to take great art out to the community are. To take workshop programming so young people can understand how to make a work of art and what does it mean to have a work of art hanging in a museum. And we found that the confrontation with a reason has very many far reaching and positive effects.

Speaker 3 00:04:58.850
Well could you give an example of a of a specific community program that has operated or is operating out of the Met.

Speaker 6 00:05:06.470
Oh yes I can give you several. I'll give you the first one which is called the first fruits workshop program. This is a program devoted to teaching art but at the same time use utilizing the museum's collection as a resource as a teaching tool. In order to bring about a better understanding and attitudinal changes of museums and are generally most of the participants are in the community and they're in community centers and alternative schools there and why W and YMCA is why. Why did the they are in senior citizen centers and we even have one segment of that program devoted to prisons. Meet the staff artist who is contracted to teach the class brings his class into the museum and teaches in the community. At the same time and this brings about a confrontation with a work of art I must say again for with a reason for example of their learning technique is learning how to use the materials the utensils of an artist if they're learning what form in terms of sculpture for shortening what all that means they see it and many times they have an opportunity to study and to stay with the object for a meaningful period of time. And we find that the works which are produced from these workshops have a great deal of meaning to the young people because the request has been I won't say just young but all people do the elderly the people seem to come back to the museum because they understand what a work of art is all about. They understand the work of art is a fragile thing. They understand that talent is a very fragile and most unusual gift and they understand that one must know something about the technique must know something about the tools of an artist and must know something about the the social media in which that work of art is being produced. And in this way we find an old black teaching situation developing because they learn a lot about history geography. They learn very much about mathematics of course and color concepts which brings into the entire realm of physics of color and also chemistry. They learn what's new what technology and art is all about and these things come about as a result of a very careful approach to a given teaching situation in a recreational setting.

Speaker 3 00:07:25.320
Now do you have actual studios that these groups work in. Or is it just an area where they come and display their work.

Speaker 6 00:07:33.810
Well they don't just come and display their work the studios are held in the communities and working with a community group. The museum requests certain things they request that the artists be allowed to have one special place where the class can come and come each week and where all the materials and supplies can be under lock and key and made available each week because to break the continuity be for physical reasons certainly does not do any any any any good for the program nor for the students because it breaks a trend or breaks a thought it breaks the interest and proves to be a very great distraction. Art is a discipline and consequently we try to create some semblance of artistic discipline within a recreational setting and we find that community groups are especially cooperative with us because they enjoy the program and they ask for it over and over and over again. And we have a waiting list constantly for such work.

Speaker 5 00:08:22.160
How many such sites do you have now and how does someone get into the site. Someone have to be in Manhattan or do you go to the Bronx. You go to Queens you go to Westchester.

Speaker 4 00:08:37.39.99999999994179
How do you approach this. Well we approach this on a borough wide basis. We have them in each of the five boroughs and the number of workshops per year per 10 weeks period so to speak is based upon unfortunately that old bugaboo funding.

Speaker 6 00:08:52.070
We received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts for three years and of course as they terminate all of these specialized community educational programs at the end of three years in New York State Council on the Arts fortunately has picked it up and they've maintained the program ever since. And the museum has also given funding for this particular program to make certain that it does continue the prison segment of course is one it's a very interesting one which has worked in conjunction with hospital audiences and this program of course does not allow the students to come into the museum to have this confrontation but we use as many facsimiles and replicas and books and demonstrations and prints and photographs all kinds of superimposed visuals to at least substitute for the real thing and we find that when the prisoners very often are released they come into the museum and they come to see some of things they've seen on slides for example and we send out lecturers and artists who who work in the prisons. All right so you have in conjunction with in any given period maybe what five 10 of these within program normally withdrawn anywhere from about 50 a year to about 90 a year and this year I think it's a little bit lower because of the funding. And we find too that some of the community groups are beginning to want to offer something to keep the workshops going.

Speaker 5 00:10:23.190
And all right I'll do. If I am in a community group. How do I get this great service. I call Kathy chance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You can call me at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and you can also the Department of call the Department of Community Programs and what is the phone number that the phone number is 8 7 9 5 500.

Speaker 6 00:10:44.860
And the extension for community programs is 6 6 6 and for urban affairs it's 4 4 2.

Speaker 5 00:10:51.770
All right let's give it to the audience again the number to get information about these workshops in the community is 8 7 9 by 500. Right. And the community programs its extension 6 6 6 and for urban affairs it's extension four or two. Correct.

Speaker 4 00:11:11.000
Now just ask for either one and you'll be put right through.

Speaker 3 00:11:14.450
All right now what is the difference between these two departments. You have community programs and urban affairs. What does one do at the other end of the doesn't do and vice versa.

Speaker 6 00:11:23.510
OK. Community programs of course involves a process of growth and development of audience development and community education programming. And after doing this for five years the museum felt that I could work on a higher level in the area of urban affairs on a legislative liaison level. And we are still developing an approach and concept for an overall viewpoint of and philosophy for urban affairs. Right now we are concentrating on working with the state and city government to ascertain the right environment and the right atmosphere for understanding what museum capitalization is all about and why we need special funds. We were very happy to note that Governor Carey a lot at 7 million dollars for the Arts in New York State just recently. But to see how much you know this is good but we have to continue this kind of push to make certain that museums and all cultural institutions are considered a part of the economic pie really services are very dear and very costly and museums especially when we get involved with working with a community which is bereft of services and a community which is bereft of funds to pay for services. Consequently the Metropolitan must provide many free services and not only to the community but also to the scouting community to the university and academic community as well as to the hobbyists and the kind of saw and to the researcher into the restore and to people who look for specialized futures in museums. So it's a big job as a job of great magnitude. And the museum has to reach out in every direction even into the federal government with the passage of the National Museum Services Act which as it develops is going to be a source of supply. We hope in great abundance to allow museums to develop in an ideal utopian kind of way. Of course when we asked for the ideal we always get the reality and half of what we really need but this is good.

Speaker 3 00:13:37.970
Well of course this reflects a change in a sense in the whole artistic community as I said at the beginning of the program for a long period of time that fine arts were viewed as the preserve of the wealthy and the more better educated and the people who had the time the leisure to indulge in on the other hand it's so important in any society that the arts really in essence be part of the conscience of the society that the people average people poor people or older people handicapped people have become more and more involved in the arts and as a result there's been more pressure on these private institutions which then has caused increasing pressure on the public agencies the state and the federal government and the city to help support these cultural institutions. And that does raise a very big question because at a time when we have needs for economic development we have need to improve the quality of education. You have another group of institutions demanding money.

Speaker 4 00:14:38.790
Well we not another group within there all alone lending money. Well of course you have been with them.

Speaker 7 00:14:43.960
I'm talking about this press it's been written about in many of the journals about the importance of getting more support for the Arts. And one reason why on soul of reason we frequently invite artists or representatives of the artistic community to talk with us is in extend this understanding and appreciation of the art. Yes Your job is very important. That's what we're really saying. Well let's talk about what the museum does in terms of taking its works.

Speaker 8 00:15:16.120
From the museum to the community in terms of traveling exhibits.

Speaker 9 00:15:21.220
I know it's difficult and probably undesirable to take very very valuable paintings and pieces of sculpture all over the metropolitan area to every individual school or college or community group but you must have some way of presenting what's happening in the museum to people in a way that they can see and even feel some of this. So what do you have in those programs.

Speaker 10 00:15:45.190
Yes we have a burro exhibition program whereby we do send out small but quality exhibitions to museums in the communities which qualify as I qualify. I mean physically qualify we have to be always concerned about the quality and the special health of the object and its environment in which is going to be placed after all we do not want to destroy anything as fragile because we want people 5000 years from now to enjoy things that we've made for a thousand years before Christ was born. Consequently things have to be maintained in their own home environment. So some things just cannot be sent down for posterity purposes. However we do have a number of small but quality thematic shows that go out to the Bronx Museum on the arts to Bedford Stuyvesant restoration to Amy sale del Barrio to the Queens Museum and to the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences and a number of these local museums do request museum exhibitions each year. However we find that sometimes they may ask just to lend a just to borrow a couple of objects to support what they're already doing. And this is good. We never tried to force an exhibition on any community organization or museum. We tried to wait until they asked us for it. If we have something we think might be of interest to them. We'll approach them if they don't want it that's something else again.

Speaker 11 00:17:09.250
Do you have any traveling exhibits that go for example to the public schools. Do you have a mobile that has slide presentations and tape presentations or do you have things like that that schools could get on request.

Speaker 10 00:17:20.829.9999999998836
Well we do have slide presentations. We have lecturers who can go out to the schools and deliver slide lectures on the art. We have had some mobile exhibitions we have some things which we have sent out upon request. We did have a burro exhibition program but those kinds of things are extraordinarily costly. What was the barrier. It was a Queensboro library project which was conducted about three years ago in the libraries of Queens and we find to the city institutions and bureaucracies are very often difficult to deal with in terms of providing adequate space for an object or providing the necessary guardianship and many times as a lot of bureaucratic red tape that one must go through in order to develop a program and becomes a very very costly experience. But in working with libraries we found that the objects were a very great interest but we found that we had to support the the exhibition by providing related services. We had to have lectures we had to have demonstrations we had storytellers for example we had books on view. Some librarians and some teachers in some areas could relate to this and others could not. And I think what happens is that we learn as we grow in this entire process of educational growth and development in the arts that this is feasible and good but we must have more funding in order to to do this now we have a junior museum. We have a Department of high school programs and these two departments definitely relate to the various age levels. The junior museum anywhere from age 2 up to about twelve and between 14 and high school graduation.

Speaker 9 00:19:02.180
Now would you say that junior museum is this a a physical place. Yes it is. The the the museum itself the young people can go and appreciate art which they might be able to understand a little bit more easily. Yes indeed. And of course you have literally I would say hundreds of thousands of visitors. Absolutely. Children Yes.

Speaker 12 00:19:22.690
Coming on the various school visitations to the museum tonight on soul of reason we are talking with Kathy chance who is special assistant for urban affairs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And we've been talking thus far about the various community outreach programs that the Mets sponsors.

Speaker 11 00:19:39.380
Let's talk about the black art objects themselves. Fine. I know that the museum has been criticized in the past for not adequately representing black art. I might mention that it isn't only the Metropolitan Museum of Art it's practically every museum in this country precisely as was shown this spring a if the Brooklyn Museum and the summer where they had two centuries of Afro-American art with the attendant controversies that surround things like that which art do you select which art do you exclude. Is there adequate interpretation. And I know I believe was Hilton Kramer of The Times in his analysis of the exhibit said that there was more of a social statement than an artistic statement not to evaluate that particular exhibit. But what is the meat itself doing to get more representative works of black artists and how are these being displayed activity.

Speaker 10 00:20:40.500
All right. The Metropolitan Museum of Art at present is currently well it's presently buying works by black artists. It's not done with a with a great deal of fanfare. It's not done with a big promotional effort but very quietly and selectively. The Department of 20th century art has begun to develop its own collection. Now we decided to put together all the works by black artists that were in the museum into a collection a collective exhibition which went to Bedford status and restoration. About two years ago and this exhibition included about 26 pieces of work. Pieces of art which we found in the department not only the 20th century department but the Department of American American paintings and sculpture. We have done consent and of course Horace Pippin and tanners and we put this entire exhibition together and we found that it was small but a jewel of a of a collection. And since that time other works have been purchased and you must remember that as a and as an encyclopedic museum the emphasis is not on contemporary art. So consequently acquisitions funds are highly curtailed in that for that particular department. And it's really a matter of money. Now some gifts have been given to the museum in all departments. People are constantly giving things to the museum and many people do purchase works of art and give them to the Metropolitan Museum. And unfortunately black people have not had the substantial funds to to make this kind of gift to an all white institution.

Speaker 11 00:22:24.390
Of course on the other hand some of us would say that since this institution represents the public it has public funds and it is in New York City. The institution has an obligation to see that there is an adequate representation of black artists.

Speaker 10 00:22:38.790
Well I think it's doing that and it's doing that within the framework and within the context of an encyclopedic Fine Arts Museum. Now I don't want to sound as though I'm an apologist for the museum because I'm constantly screaming about this.

Speaker 11 00:22:52.680
We must be talking about this and saying oh what I say in the inner sanctum is one thing and what I say out here sometimes it has to you really develop that collapse very clearly by pointing up at the the holdings in the past have been very small and the museum is doing something to try to accelerate that particular collection because whereas the black artist mirror black American art haven't been well known they have been working literally for two or three hundred years and they've done some really really excellent work. DIA Do you have any work of black sculptors for example.

Speaker 10 00:23:25.350
Yes we do. We have Richard Hunt for example. And I think there's something about pathway. I'm not sure. I think there's something about him. There's one other work and I'm not sure which is which it is right now. I think I'm getting prematurely C now because I can't remember everything.

Speaker 11 00:23:40.530
Well that is true that some of the black artists more recent ones tend to function more in the modern middle year. Yes but I believe the Met does carry some in terms of its encyclopedic role of modern work.

Speaker 10 00:23:54.300
Oh yes we do. We have a department which is called the 20th century our contemporary art department. And that is the department that of course is the smallest department in the newest in the museum and acquisitions funds and funding to that department is certainly not in comparison to what we have in Egyptian. Of course Egyptian too is black of course Islamic is partly black. And of course African we know we have the brilliant Rockefeller collection which is going to open in 1979 its own museum at the MIT and we're going to begin to develop even more in that direction. Fortunately I think I'm there to help urge this along.

Speaker 13 00:24:32.690
I think you are. And I think you've made your point very clear because it is really inconsistent in modern day America for any social institution whether it be an institution in music or art literature or economic development or education not to represent the contributions of black Americans. The fact is when you talked about the 20th century collection itself being one of the smaller departments that really reflects the overall problem of black people that we you have gotten here and beginning to get our fruits. Very very late in the time period of our country and at the time when the pie is getting increasingly smaller. So that's the problem we have and that's been why we need people like Kathy chance as an advocate within the organization and some of the rest of us as advocates from out the organization particularly going back to some of the things that the Metro medium had tried to do in the past such as the Harlem on My Mind exhibit which did not receive the best reception in the black community because one of the things that I think the social institutions cultural institutions like the Met must recognize is that they do serve the entire spectrum of the country and particularly the city which is certainly now anywhere from 30 to 35 percent minority depending when I count it. Talking about that I understand that there was some question about adding some physical structure to the museum and some of the citizens along Fifth Avenue and other parts of the city were concerned about defacing the park and extending the tentacles of the museum too far up and down Fifth Avenue. Where do we stand on that now. Is there going to be a physical expansion that protrudes into the park or down on Fifth Avenue. What's going on with.

Speaker 10 00:26:23.140
Well the physical expansion has already been cleared and everything that's going to be built I guess for the next century. You really are already up now the Lehman collection the Lehman wing has been completed. The Rockefeller wing the outside shell of that wing is ready and we're working on the inside. Now they'll be open in 79. The American wing will be open in 1980 81. The new phase of the third phase of the Egyptian installation including new adding to the temple of Indore will complete the building program. Then there is the slight addition to the southwest wing which would which is the basis of the museum's collection. The Western European section and the 20th century all of those are under consideration. Unfortunately education and the educational wing is about the last thing to be considered.

Speaker 9 00:27:22.510
And the fact that under the assumption that the entire museum is educational design that people learn slowly. Well I don't know if either one is true or maybe both are true.

Speaker 10 00:27:32.800
But I do know that education is under way fund development program a consideration study right now to see exactly which direction is going to take if there should be a an educational division or department if it's feasible if there should be some kind of retrieval or informational system to enhance the educational concept of what the museums charter is all about and that's to manufacture quote unquote popular instruction.

Speaker 11 00:28:02.740
Now in terms of community groups getting any brochures or information about what's available do you have things that the people in the audience could write for and obtain.

Speaker 10 00:28:11.620
Yes we do. They we have brochures we have pamphlets we have all kinds of publications to which people might receive how might they get that right they can get there by writing to me. Kathy chance Department of Urban Affairs Metropolitan Museum of Art eighty second Street and Fifth Avenue New York City 128 and I might just add we also have a community Gallery.

Speaker 9 00:28:31.750
Oh that's excellent. There really is. What about volunteers. Do we have volunteers from the community to help with some of these programs.

Speaker 10 00:28:37.570
Yes we do and we want to have volunteers from all over New York City and the surrounding area to come and take part.

Speaker 11 00:28:44.980
And again if volunteers are interested they should contact the Department of Community programming at the Met or even contact community programs you can contact me in Department of Urban Affairs.

Speaker 10 00:28:56.050
You can contact public information. You can contact the Department of Education. And there are many ways to find out.

Speaker 12 00:29:03.340
And the telephone number of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is 8 7 9 5 500 extension 6 6 6 for the Department of Community Programs and extension 4 for 2 for the Department of Urban Affairs.

Speaker 11 00:29:15.820
And Cathy it's really been nice having you with us this evening.

Speaker 10 00:29:18.610
Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure.

Speaker 1 00:29:20.890
This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for soul of reason.
