Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:22.170
This is "Soul of Reason, " a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:49.110
Alex Haley's epic historical novel "Roots" has been acclaimed throughout the world. Recently the Gambian government sponsored a cultural mission to the United States to help bridge the cultural gap between United States and Gambia, particularly American Blacks and the Gambians. And with us on "Soul of Reason" this evening, to discuss their visit and to discuss Alex's memorable work, is Bakari Sidibe, who is minister of Cultural Affairs; Sam Kinte, who is a cousin of Alex Haley from the Kinte clan; and Jay Saidy, who is with The Gambian News Bulletin, which I understand is the Gambian government-sponsored newspaper. And as we were saying before the show, the United States, I guess, presents sort of an interesting picture to people who haven't been here before or haven't been here a great deal. So I will ask you, Sam Kinte, is this your first visit to the States?

Sam Kinte 00:01:45.991
No, this is my third visit to the States. I've been here on two other occasions.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:51.901
And what did you do when you were here before?

Sam Kinte 00:01:54.802
My first visit to the United States was--came on a brief study at the University of Maryland College Park, and that was the first time that I was exposed to--not just--to American way of life. The second one was a State Department sponsorship which took me on a brief tour of the United States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:15.221
[crosstalk] Nice.

Sam Kinte 00:02:15.491
[crosstalk] This is another trip.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:17.851
Mr. Sidibe, what about your previous visits, if any, to the United States?

Bakari Sidibe 00:02:22.532
I was also at Indiana University on a fellowship for four months. And, like Mr. Kinte, I also was a guest of the State Department, and had opportunity to travel around the States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:40.470
And I understand, Mr. Saidy, from The Gambian News Bulletin, that this is your first trip to the States. And I was really wondering what your impressions are, as contrasted with what you thought the States would be like?

Jay Saidy 00:02:53.730
Oh yes, it's my first trip, as you just said. I find it a very exciting experience to come to the United States, to have traveled extensively to various parts. In the South, in parts especially--I was a bit surprised not to find so much of the racial segregation of which we have read a lot in the past. I think a lot of changes have taken place now, and a small harmony between the races.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:29.464
And basically the reason why you expected there to be a lot of segregation is that what the news media had shown, and I guess what you had read about and seen in the Gambian and the national--and the international--press, in a sense.

Jay Saidy 00:03:36.401
[crosstalk]

00:03:36.402
Precisely. Precisely. Precisely.

Jay Saidy 00:03:36.401
Precisely,

00:03:36.402
yes. Not only in the Gambia--in Europe, too. I was in Europe as a student, and I read a lot about the racial segregation in the South and Deep South, as they call it, in the United States, yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:53.581
[crosstalk] Well, some people feel that the European press in particular--and a certain extent African press, but particularly European press--is very hard on the United States by really building up every single incident of racial friction to say that Blacks are really oppressed. The other day I talked with a friend of mine whose cousin had just come from the Soviet Union--and a person of Jewish background--and went to a city and saw Blacks going in the department stores together, and they went to a clinic and a Black woman had to go in, and she gave her baby to this white woman to hold while she went in to see the doctor. And the cousin said, "Well, this is not the way the United States is supposed to be! [Unintelligible] In the Soviet Union, we hear that Blacks are completely separate from whites." Now, do you think, as particular as a journalist, Mr. Saidy, do you think this is something that the European press intentionally does to sort of make the United States look bad, or do you think it's because they really don't know?

Jay Saidy 00:04:54.001
Well I think there is a lot of dramatizing. I think they overstress, sometimes, these incidents of racial tension or racial discrimination that one finds in the United States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:09.960
And of course we all know--particularly those of us who are Black Americans--that there is still a tremendous amount of discrimination. But it isn't the physical type that we used to have back in the 30s and 40s and during the slavery period, when Blacks were randomly lynched and beaten upon, and spat upon, and that kind of thing. But there is definitely a racial segregation--and let's say racial discrimination rather than segregation, which is a legal phenomenon in the States. Have you noticed--have any one of the three of you noticed--any incidents or any suggestions that Black people are treated somewhat differently, socially and job-wise, since you've been here? What about you, Mr. Sidibe, have you notice anything like that?

Bakari Sidibe 00:05:50.850
No, I haven't been exposed to anything of that kind, because our dealings have mostly been with Blacks, in the South, in Boston, and other places. We really--I haven't myself come across anything like that, no.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:06.420
What about your observations, Mr. Kinte, as you walk the streets? Do you notice anything in particular?

Sam Kinte 00:06:10.951
It's--no, I didn't, because it's never apparent. The only apparent form of discrimination would be the physical one, as you say. I think it has become--I think now, even where people know that they don't see our common ideals and common philosophy, they play it cool, and rather being hypocritical about it and smile to each other. So for a visitor it would be very difficult to notice, and I think it's the Black Americans themselves who can spotlight this, and not visitors, like as I am.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:43.083
A very, very astute observation. All right, let's talk about Alex Haley, because that's really why you're here, and it's why we want to talk to you about not only Gambia, but about the reaction that Alex's book has had in Gambia. And one of the things I'd like to know is, have many Gambians read the book itself, recognizing that the book is hard to get and it's all the way across the ocean? What about that, Mr. Sidibe--have many Gambians read the book?

Bakari Sidibe 00:07:13.140
I think many Gambians were excited about the book. Many tried to get copies to read. They were not available on sale at the time that it was published. But people made efforts, through friends were coming to America to bring home copies to read, and those who had shared it, shared it with their friends. Many read--I think it's one of the greatest things that happened to Gambia. And for this reason everyone felt very proud and wanted to read the book, and know all about it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:55.920
What about the television presentation, Mr. Kinte? Do you really have television in Gambia, or do you show these films in a theater?

Sam Kinte 00:08:06.540
Well, we don't have televisions in the Gambia, so the films are shown in a theater. And the first four hours of "Roots" was shown in the Gambia at the same time that it was being launched in the United States, because a group of journalists, does the national inquiry from Florida, taped this on a videotape and went straight to Juffure--had the privilege of coming to Juffure. So I would say it was the village of Juffure that first saw "Roots." Well since then, when Alex been to the Gambia, he took back some things that are shown in the theater. And these are shown in two ways, for serialize, and some certain sessions are invited guest and certain sessions are for the public. Now it is, this would have to be given to the mobile film unit to show it throughout the country. As Mr. Sidibe says, I think this invites a lot of excitement about "Roots," also as it is in the United States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:04.060
Well, Mr. Saidy, how did the Gambian press respond to the content of "Roots?" I mean, did they feel that the African backgrounds were adequately shown? Did they feel that the story of Kunta Kinte was well told? How did the press respond to this?

Jay Saidy 00:09:24.330
I think it's generally accepted that the story was told in its true context. In fact, it's a pity we don't have here a copy of the Gambian News Bulletin, in which an article appeared which was published by Mr. Sidibe, who himself is here. In this article, he tried to clarify his position with regards to the statements made by Ottaway, in doubt--in casting doubt--on the authenticity of the story as told by Alex's informant, who is now deceased--namely, Kanga Fofana.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:08.402
For the audience who are not aware of this, a British reporter by the name of Ottaway released a story in The London Times, which was picked up in some of the New York newspapers and throughout the country, that some of the sources used by Alex Haley in developing the story of the Kinte clan were really not completely adequate. And he quoted the story--at least, quoted Mr. Sidibe--as saying that he had written to Alex and had allegedly warned him that the source from Fofana was not particularly accurate. Could you, Mr. Sidibe, discuss with us exactly what happened so that it'll be on the air and on the record, in terms of what the real situation was?

Bakari Sidibe 00:10:55.770
Yes. I must, first of all, say that nobody was warned against Kanga Fofana, or I certainly didn't warn Mr. Haley because I had no reason to warn him against. When Ottaway came into my office, I was busy preparing to go to Mali on a recording trip, and I had really no time to talk to him about what he wanted to know. He gave me the impression that Alex was coming to London, and he was the reporter who was preparing the way for Alex, but had been to Juffure and talked to Kebba Kanga Fofana's family, and got the impression there that Fofana was not a born griot.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:04.463
Now just for a moment, could you indicate to the audience exactly what a griot is? You use the term a "born griot."

Bakari Sidibe 00:12:12.931
A griot is like a traditional bard, a person who tells a traditional--traditional stories, family histories. And it's a class of its own, and they are attached to families--to patron families--and they record the histories of these families, and they have occasion when they sit around and recite these histories. We look to them for the recording and, you know, transmission of the oral histories of our people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:55.772
And what is the language that this is transmitted in?

Bakari Sidibe 00:12:59.460
It depends on the tribe, because Mandinkas have griots, Wolof have griots, Fulas have griots. And they will transmit in a language that the members of which are, say, consist of--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:14.422
[crosstalk] Well Fofana spoke in Mandinka.

Bakari Sidibe 00:13:16.052
Fofana was a Mandinka, yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:17.895
And you were saying that it was alleged that he wasn't a born griot, which suggests that he hadn't had the training or the tradition--is that what was intended by that statement?

Bakari Sidibe 00:13:29.191
No, I guess he was looking for blood relationship, because Fofana had the training. Fofana became a griot in his youth, and acquired the training and was quite good at it in his time, and became a well-known griot in his life. And at the time that Alex was recording him he was probably nearly 70. When I recorded him, he was over 70 and was not actively playing any instrument. But his stories were still his stories and he was telling them as griots would tell them. And Ottaway's idea is that you have to become a traditional griot before your story can be authentic, which is--which is wrong. Not only griots know the oral histories of our people. Elders know it, too. And in my letter to Alex Haley, I tried to make it known to him that we look for oral history from griots and traditional elders. And at the time I was writing that letter, Kebba Kanga qualified for both of these--he was a griot and an elder. He was always called at--for elders meetings in the village. Elders give the kind of information that is specific, like they give you very clear genealogies. They know their families--immediate families. They know the village well; they know the interrelationships between families very well. They can tell you a good--give you a good list of the genealogy. Now griots are artists.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:45.943
[crosstalk] Elders, by definition, are older people. Does one have to be a particular age to be an elder?

Bakari Sidibe 00:15:52.680
You would have to be at least very close to 68, 70 plus. And you would have, perhaps, to be recognized as a prominent elder in a village, you must also, perhaps, be in a position to represent your lineage. And Kebba Kanga Fofana was the head of his family and the head of his lineage at that time. As I was saying, the griot's story is always more detailed--that is, the artist's--unlike any novelist or writer in your society--is capable of expanding a story, to show his creativity. So also is a griot able to show his creativity. But the core of the story which a griot tells, and what an elder tells, would be exactly the same.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:01.932
One of the alleged points of difference had to do with the date at which Kunta Kinte is supposed to have run away and been captured, and according to some historians, the situations that were described by Haley in the book really were situations that occurred possibly as much as 30 or 40 years after it was alleged that Kunta was captured. Now, is that something that can really be pinned down that accurately, or is it just sort of a ball--I use the term "ballpark figure," that's an American term for something that's generally in the vicinity. Maybe Sam, I noticed you [crosstalk] wanted to respond--

Sam Kinte 00:17:42.300
I would say, as Mr. Sidibe has just pointed out, when these people tell histories and the like, there is a problem over dates. They cannot pin it down to an exact date, but they will always remember an event that occurred around which that particular thing have happened. For instance, say, an elder--something might have happened the year that Kennedy was assassinated. So if you are told that an event had happened, when so-and-so happened, then it's left with you to get it in time. Now, coming back to the Ottaway family mentioned this: there was no reason for Ottaway to doubt Kebba Kanga Fofana, because the fact is Alex did not only interview Kebba Kanga Fofana. When he did, he had to verify it with the rest of the Kintes. There are five Kinte settlements in the Gambia. And it happened, at the time, the eldest Kinte in the lineage was in my own immediate family. And the story Kebba Kanga Fofana said was verified at all levels. In fact, before Alex went to the Gambia, it was a well-known fact in the family that along the line, some time in history, some member--a member of the family, by the name of Kunta Kinte--got missing. Now, my total interpretation of Mike Ottaway's reaction to this thing: I believe if "Roots" had not been successful, he wouldn't have criticized it. The fact that he did doubt and criticize is a clear indication of the success of "Roots." And also this is an old tactics, white tactics, too, because the point is "Roots" had done something significant, bringing Black communities all over the world together. Which, probably, he might feel as a threat, being what he is, and so he would find ways and means of shattering it. Because it is ridiculous for somebody to start breaking down what--work that had been done in 12 years, in three days or four days. And according to Mr. Sidibe, again, there you find his motive from the very onset was destructive, because he posed and purported to be a representative or to be an employee, or to be somebody who was interested in what Alex was doing. So, in fact, in his [unintelligible], in his own paper, he described Kebba Kanga Fofana as a notorious liar. And I would feel--and I would say back--that Ottaway is probably the most incredible liar in the world!

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:27.901
Well I can see that it certainly did create a certain amount of concern among you folks in Gambia. Since that has transpired, though, has it had any effect in terms of getting people more interested or less interested in Gambia? I would imagine that one of the reasons for your visit here is to encourage tourism to Gambia--at least, it was reported in some elements of the press that significant numbers of Black Americans in particular, but people from all of the world, wanted to come to Gambia, particularly to Juffure--the village where Kinte was supposed to have come--to visit. Now, has this had any effect on your tourism? Has your tourism gone up? Has it gone down?

Jay Saidy 00:21:12.782
[crosstalk] Could I answer that, please?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:14.611
[crosstalk] Okay, Mr. Saidy.

Jay Saidy 00:21:16.141
I think our tourism is going up beyond all bounds. Already, long before we came to the United States, over 2,000 Americans had indicated their desire to visit the Gambia later this year--in July alone. And by now, those figures must have gone up tremendously. The interest here, in the United States, in Gambia is manifest everywhere we went--all over the southern states and eastern parts of the United States. We have been overwhelmed with invitations. People wanted to meet us or wanted to talk to us. There have been reporters, newspapers, television, and radio wanting to talk to us, and then all that springs from the great interest--the enormous interest--that this book has generated, this "Roots." So I think there's no doubt about it whatsoever that we are going to have a big surge of Americans to the Gambia. Our tourist official who is with us, July the General, had been very busy making contacts with tour operators, with travel agencies, who were interested in promoting tours to the Gambia. I think it's overwhelming. Our problem now would be whether we would be able to accommodate all the Americans who would be visiting us in the near future.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:45.140
What about the village of Juffure itself? I had read somewhere that it was going to be made a national monument or a national historical center. I'd also read that--I believe it was either Alex or some people related to him--were going to establish a museum there. What is the status of that at the present time? Sam? Sam Kinte?

Sam Kinte 00:23:06.760
Well, Juffure has since been declared a national monument and it is receiving careful attention thus planning. We don't want to rush things in Juffure; we want planning to be sturdy and to have long-term effects. Now, that's the position as it is. I happen to be a member of the Relics and Monument Commission--Mr. Sidibe and myself--and this is receiving very close attention at the moment. And if I may clarify one situation here: this present mission has not been--have not come into existence--to come and defend "Roots." I think our government had the goodwill, after realizing that there had been a lot of indications from American people to visit the Gambia, they feel the American population should be given a preview of Gambian way of life--what to expect in the Gambia. This is what motivated it, and not, sort of, to come and defend "Roots." It is, without, even, "Roots." Anybody who is associated with the history of the Gambia would know that quite a lot of Black Americans in America must have hailed in that part of the world. A clear manifestation of this is James Island, just opposite Juffure, where the ancient fort still stand. When--history has it that this place was used as a store for transit slaves. So that is a living--a manifest--a living testimony of it. And our talking about "Roots" and Ottoway happen to be only incidental that--with the controversy people who are interested in, and we can throw light on it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:58.101
[crosstalk] I can understand that.

Sam Kinte 00:24:58.104
[crosstalk] And, incidentally, Kebba married Fofana, where Fofanas are cousins of the Kintes. And that entitled them to know the history of the Kinte lineage. There had been a lot of intermarriages between the Kintes and the Fofanas all along. And this gentleman in question--in fact, Mary's elder cousin--Binta Kinte.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:18.051
Mr. Sidibe, I believe that you had worked with Alex many years ago, because I first heard the story of "Roots"--if you want to call it that, or Alex's voyage into his past--in 1968. And he had indicated that he had been working with some of the people in the Gambian Cultural Ministry. I didn't realize that maybe you were the person. What type of assistance did your ministry provide to Alex in helping to pull the story together?

Bakari Sidibe 00:25:52.571
It's in collecting information around that area about his roots, talking to as many different people as possible. Not with the intention of getting them to support Alex's story, but also to know what other records there were. And I think this was the reason why I wrote the letter, which Ottoway quoted. The letter was written to Alex to indicate to him that there are other sources, and I wanted to tap these sources. I wanted to make as many things available as possible, and we did that. We got in touch with people, we recorded them, and we sent some of these recordings--transcribed recordings, translated--to Alex.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:03.002
Mr. Saidy, in terms of the future of the relationship between American Blacks and people of the Gambia, do you feel that some specific things will be growing out of this that will bring those of us--those of us Blacks on either side of the ocean--closer together?

Jay Saidy 00:27:20.460
Oh yes, definitely. I think it has, in fact, already done so. Because as I have just said, the number of Americans who have indicated a desire to go to Gambia and visit are so many, that we have the trouble now of having to cope with it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:39.431
[crosstalk] Overwhelmed by success.

Jay Saidy 00:27:40.720
[crosstalk] Right. Overwhelmed by success.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:42.610
What about, just as an aside as we come to the end of the program, we've been talking about music and I asked Sam Kinte, "What kind of music do you listen to?," and I said, "Do you listen to Stevie and Ray Charles and Aretha?" And what did you say about that?

Sam Kinte 00:27:54.610
Well, I'm a great patronizer of jazz music and of Western music and all that, and go to dances and like that. At the same time, when at home, I'm very much concerned with traditional music--the kora, the balafon--and like, I love it because this is traditional. There are sometimes that I want sort of a variety, probably what I have acquired in Western culture. But predominantly, it's kora and balafon.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:23.654
That's really a very beautiful way in which to close the program. Our guests on tonight's "Soul of Reason" have been Mr. Bakari Sidibe, who is a Minister of Cultural Affairs; Sam Kinte from the Kinte clan, cousin of Alex Haley; Jay Saidy, who is with the Gambian News Bulletin, and we've been talking about the impact of "Roots" not only on America but on Gambia, and the mutual relationship between these two great countries. Thanks for being our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason."
