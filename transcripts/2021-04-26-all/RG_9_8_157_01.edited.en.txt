What coach once coached the Olympic track team of three nations simultaneously? We're talking about the famous Joe Yancey, co-founder of The New York Pioneer Club who will be honored on Sunday April 27th at the Waldorf Astoria. Here Joe Yancey discussed the highlights of his fabulous career on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:42.791
This is "Soul of Reason." A program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:09.730
Our guest on this evening's "Soul of Reason" is Joe Yancey, a man who's known to many men in the New York area and throughout the world because of his exploits in the world of track. Joe Yancey along with William Culbreath and Bob Douglas co-founded the New York Pioneer Club in 1936. And over these many years the Pioneer Club and Joe Yancey in particular have done tremendous things for youth of all colors and complexions all over the world. Glad to have you with us tonight Joe.

Joe Yancey 00:01:40.031
My pleasure Roscoe. I'm very happy to be here with you. See you again.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:44.621
Your friends have decided that it's about time to honor you and you're a man who tends to try to stay in the background. [Yancey laughs] But they've decided to honor you and you're going to do so on Sunday April 27th at the Waldorf Astoria hotel and people from all over the country literally from all over the world are going to come to reminisce to see you and to talk about what's happening. And I imagine this must make you feel both very warm and very proud and also probably give you a certain amount of anxiety cause you wonder what these guys are going to say when they come in to meet you. How do you really feel about this affair?

Joe Yancey 00:02:25.510
Well actually Roscoe it's going to be a great joy to me. Very gratifying. As you just mentioned I am a quiet sort of person who likes to stay in the background and all this excitement is getting to me, but I'll manage. But it'll be a great occasion actually to see so many old friends and greet them and say hello. I think it's gonna be wonderful. I hope it's gonna be a real gala night.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:58.480
Well if we run down the names of the people who've been exposed to Pioneer Club and Joe Yancey reads like a who's who in track. World record holders people who've gone on to all types of professional positions people who've gone into show business and so on, so that you have had a tremendous impact on the lives of young people. So what led you and Bob Douglas and William Culbreath to start the Pioneer Club? This is something that I've always wondered about. I've known about the Pioneer Club for many many years. But I wonder just what caused you fellows to get this group of people together.

Joe Yancey 00:03:39.040
Well back in 1936 the Depression was just about ending. They're was a need for such a club because the other organizations, I mean--only had token Blacks. I mean they're was no real integration and we thought there was a need for a club that would be open to everyone. So we--I got together with my dear friend Bob Douglas and Bill Culbreath. And we organized the New York Pioneer Club in the back room of the Renaissance Casino on 138th Street and 7th Avenue.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:14.387
I think it's important to mention the legendary--in his own way, like you--Bob Douglas.

Joe Yancey 00:04:21.231
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:21.582
Who is now--eighty eight, or--

Joe Yancey 00:04:23.830
Ninety two years old--young. [laughter]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:26.260
I've known Bob for many years myself I have trouble keeping up and he himself was just recently honored along with the members of the original Renaissance by the old timers group. And of course Bob Douglas is in the Black Athletes Hall of Fame and he is in the Hall of Fame of basketball because of his efforts at bringing together this group of sensational Black ballplayers. But the thing a lot of people don't know is what Bob Douglas has done for his community and co-founding the Pioneer Club is just another one of those kinds of things.

Joe Yancey 00:04:59.380
Yes definitely. Bob has been very keen on amateur athletics for a number of years and, mentioning the Black Athletes Hall of Fame, I had the pleasure of accepting his award and he's been a longtime friend and as I said before a 92-year old/young and he's still going strong. That wonderful character and also Bill Culbreath. The other co-founder who at that time was on the staff of the athletic department at NYU--your school. [laughs] And with the three of us, I mean, we got the club started.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:40.540
Now what essentially was your mode of operation because as long as I've heard of the Pioneer Club I've never found that you had a clubhouse or one place you sort of operated out of--Pioneer Club was all over the city. How did you operate and how did you attract your performers and what type of qualification did you ask of them?

Joe Yancey 00:05:59.201
Well actually, Pioneer Club was a state of mind. We don't have a twenty-story clubhouse, I mean, we have no clubhouse--excuse me--except the playing field at Macombs Dam Park and--and indoor facilities at the 369th Regiment Armory where we've been a guest for a number of years. But our motivation has been to get these young people interested in sports. To try to develop them in that particular field of endeavor and to encourage them to seek higher education and through the years we've done just that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:40.001
I think it's beautiful that you mentioned the idea of encouraging them to seek higher education because so many of the Black athletes today do not get the education that they should get. And when you mentioned NYU, which of course is our institution, I can just see the track jerseys of people like Reggie Pearman and the Callender brothers and Larry Ellis and--

Joe Yancey 00:07:04.691
Rudy Simms.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:05.250
Rudy Simms.

Joe Yancey 00:07:05.254
Warren Halliburton--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:06.140
[crosstalk] Keep on naming 'em.

Joe Yancey 00:07:08.054
Cliff Bertrand--you can go on and on. Many Pioneers went on to NYU and of course other universities throughout the country throughout the world for that matter.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:18.581
You used to stock Villanova's team.

Joe Yancey 00:07:20.921
No, not Villanova.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:21.891
Well, Charlie Jenkins didn't--

Joe Yancey 00:07:23.200
No no, he came from New England.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:25.483
He came from New England, I see.

Joe Yancey 00:07:26.542
Just among the Pioneer athletes who competed for NYU you mentioned most of them but I'll mention them again. Reggie Pearman. Warren Halliburton. Stanton and Maurice Callender. Rudy Simms. Hugo and Richard Maiocco. Cliff Bertrand and many many others that I can't think of at the moment. [laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:49.270
Now, Cliff Bertrand as you know is the present track coach at New York University and he's bringing about a renaissance in track at NYU. I was talking to Cliff the other day and he said that yes, something like seventy applicants who want to come to NYU both to get an education which Cliff stressed just like you is number one. And also to participate in track. Where do you think the athletic world has gone off the track in allowing so much emphasis on competition and winning to obscure the importance of these athletes getting an education? [crosstalk] Where do you think they've gone off the track--

Joe Yancey 00:08:26.652
Well, just before I comment on that Roscoe, I'd like to say how proud I am of Cliff. He made a great contribution to the Pioneer Club. There are a lot of fine running for the organization and he's doing a marvelous job at NYU. But I think it--in my opinion, many individuals stress just the running and not the educational part of the college situation. I've always felt and I still do, that it's more important that a young man get an education along with his athletic endeavors and that's what I've stressed. I mean, even after they've gone on to college I've still followed their career and helped them in any way that I could. And the staff of the New York Pioneer Club joined me in that endeavor.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:22.850
Now the thing that a number of people don't know, although they could have possibly guessed it just by the way the world runs, is that you did all of this as a volunteer. [laughter] You had a full time job working for the United States government. It was at the Internal Revenue--

Joe Yancey 00:09:38.440
Internal Revenue. I'm still there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:41.952
Still there. And doing this eight hours a day and then putting your dinner in a brown bag and hitting the subway and going to the Garden to the 69th Regiment Armory or to the 369th Armory or wherever it is to work with these young people and many of us have always been impressed by the esprit de corps of the Pioneer Club and there are some young men--Black youth--in the city now who are trying to emulate this model. Groups like the Adams Track Club groups like the St. Albans Athletic Club groups like the Over The Hill Track Club--

Joe Yancey 00:10:23.530
That's true.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:23.532
--and emulating the model of young men and young women coming together to run, to participate but also to enjoy the fellowship and the emotional support that goes along with this. In my own case as you know, my name being Roscoe Brown I get confused [Yancey laughs] almost weekly by one of your graduates, I'll say--

Joe Yancey 00:10:48.062
Definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:48.067
--one of my own namesake Roscoe Lee Browne, the great actor--

Joe Yancey 00:10:53.762
That's true.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:53.763
I imagine you can tell stories on top of that.

Joe Yancey 00:10:55.892
Well Roscoe Lee Browne was a great athlete. No question about it. And he's a dear friend at the moment. In fact when I was inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame he came on from California to make the presentation and he will be here for the affair on April 27th. I'd like just to say this about the Pioneer Club, you mentioned our esprit de corps. That's been rather important to us in the Pioneer Club family. I mean an athlete must be a gentleman first and an athlete second. And we stress the development of good character. We've always done that and we feel that our Pioneers through the years have made a tremendous contribution to America not only in New York City, in New York State, but to America because they've stretched out, they've grown and so many Pioneers are doing such a marvelous job in so many varied fashions of life today.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:59.850
And you must be proud of the fact that, as we said at the top of the show, you coached the Olympic track team for three nations simultaneously in the 1956 Olympics. You coached the Jamaican team, the Bahamian team and a Trinidadian team, and they were all young men from these Caribbean countries--

Joe Yancey 00:12:16.384
Definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:17.432
--and because of your respect and your ability you were able to coach them all in this 1956 Olympics, in addition of which you have coached in Australia and coached in Tokyo and Ceylon--literally all over the world. And now in, 1976 the Olympic track coach will be a friend of both of ours--

Joe Yancey 00:12:39.811
Definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:40.601
--Dr. LeRoy Walker. He was a graduate of New York University with a PhD and also a assistant--or chancellor at the University of North Carolina--

Joe Yancey 00:12:50.950
[crosstalk] North Carolina Central.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:53.470
--at Durham. And this represents a long jump--

Joe Yancey 00:12:56.803
[crosstalk] A tremendous jump--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:57.421
--because at one time. Not only were we not allowed to be trainers or coaches but you had to literally be a superstar in order to even be considered for the trials. Could you possibly tell our audience your reactions to these changes and why you think they came about?

Joe Yancey 00:13:18.240
Well, in all modesty I think they came about because of the developing--the development of athletics among all people, not only Black people, but all people. Of course as you know, I'm the--just about the first Black coach to coach an Olympic team to victory. I guess I'm just about the first Black coach to take a AAU team abroad. And I feel that like the name of the club, the New York Pioneer Club, I'm a pioneer in that endeavor. And there are so many capable young people coming up today that it was just a matter of time before one of them would become the head coach of the United States Olympic team. Dr. LeRoy Walker is a great, great coach. I mean, a great man. He's gonna do a fine job and I support him 100 percent, as I did Stan Wright who was the assistant coach of the 1968 and 1972 United States Olympic team.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:26.050
Now of course you've added substance to that old adage, "You've got to keep on keeping on."

Joe Yancey 00:14:30.151
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:30.692
Because that's what enables any group of people to move into the mainstream of the society.

Joe Yancey 00:14:36.691
Continuity. Definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:39.151
Going back to this point I had raised earlier about why is it in our present athletic scene so many athletes both Black and white, but particularly Black youth, do not see the importance of education and do not get the education that they should get when they go to school on athletic scholarship. What do you think has brought that about?

Joe Yancey 00:15:02.340
Well, I really don't know Roscoe, and I don't have any easy cure-all for the situation. It could be lack of dedication on the part of the administration in the various colleges. I think that's where it lies. I mean, the young people don't get the proper guidance--the proper support and encouragement. They don't take the proper courses for graduation. I mean, it seems that many of them go just to play basketball or football where it's more prevalent than track and field. Track and field generally the athletes have a tendency to go all the way and graduate and get their degree.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:50.680
Well, I think part of that is what I call a function of the counter-racist attitude that exists in the society that now that the white athletic establishment has found that Blacks can participate and participate well,esprit de corps they have a tendency to use them rather than to see that these Black athletes, like white athletes, get the education that they are entitled to. And I think it relates to the commercialism. I think it relates to the heavy expenses for television the need to provide lots of money for athletic scholarships and somehow or another, I get a feeling when I talk with you and then I talk with some of the contemporary coaches, that you two live in two different worlds. When you talk about education being number one and when you talk about character--I mean you talk about dedication--to me, that's the spirit of sport. And when you talk about contracts and how much money you have for scholarships and how much money you're going to get for a guarantee to perform. To me, that smacks of business. And what do you think about that?

Joe Yancey 00:16:58.211
Well Roscoe, actually--this motivation for a higher education should start in the elementary school, on through the high school and to college, and the parents should play a part. Parents and friends, they should encourage their sons and daughters, I mean, to obtain their degree and go on to higher education. I mean, sports is just one facet of the American way of life. I think the parents have a lot to do with it. They should be more interested to see that the children have an education and be able to take their place in the mainstream of society.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:39.310
Well, that certainly is what the Pioneer Club has been about as an organization.

Joe Yancey 00:17:43.974
Very definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:44.244
You three men saw a need in your community. Now, as you retire and become less active--although you never retire, I know that--but there is a necessity of having another generation of folk to come up and continue the tradition of the Pioneer Club. And I gather that it wasn't just accidental that the club was called "The Pioneer Club" because as you said, in talking about it, you saw it as a way of breaking barriers [crosstalk] and opening things up--

Joe Yancey 00:18:15.372
Well, actually the original name of the club was the New York Olympic Club. But at that time, we were not allowed to use the word "Olympic." So we changed the name to The New York Pioneer Club because we were pioneering a new concept in athletic clubs. As far as preparing for carrying on, I mean, I have a very capable colleague Ed Levy. He's been with me since he was 16 years old. He's a graduate of NYU, he's a principal of a intermediate school in the Bronx. I have also on the staff, Glenn Shain former runner who is a graduate of St. John. And I have a real super athletic athlete on the staff also, Norman Tate. Who incidentally is a graduate--graduate, rather--of North Carolina Central, as it was called, under Dr. LeRoy Walker. So we--we're preparing to carry on, I mean, not--it's not a one-man show by any means. The staff has always been important to the advancement of the New York Pioneer Club.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:28.090
Now for those people in the audience who are interested in the Joe Yancey testimonial dinner, they should contact the Joe Yancey testimonial committee at the Statler Hilton Hotel, suite 600A.

Joe Yancey 00:19:42.011
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:42.493
And the affair will be on Sunday April 27th beginning at 6 o'clock. And I understand that Roscoe Lee is flying in to emcee and if anyone has ever seen Roscoe emcee-- Roscoe Lee, at least--emcee, they really have seen something.

Joe Yancey 00:19:58.061
I hope it's gonna be a good show.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:59.800
I'm certain it will be. Now speaking of just the pure athletic nature of your activities in the Pioneer Club, what in retrospect has been your greatest thrill? I do notice you mentioned winning this Olympic championship--

Joe Yancey 00:20:15.520
Oh yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:15.522
--in 1952, being the first Black coach to do it, and that has to be very very high. What really, as you think about it, because when you're in sports, there's so many peaks as well as a lot of valleys--

Joe Yancey 00:20:27.670
Oh yes, definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:28.231
--that you have some difficulty pulling it out, but you've been in the business now for forty some-odd years. What's your peak?

Joe Yancey 00:20:38.080
Well, I've had many thrills--I mean, winning the 4 x 400 meter relay with the Jamaican Olympic team in 1952 was certainly one of them. Winning the national indoor championship in 1951 was another. Winning our first indoor metropolitan championship was another great achievement, and winning an outdoor metropolitan championship. And also the many great relay teams that we developed through the years, and the fellowship and camaraderie and the love that I get from the athletes all through the years that's been so gratifying and so wonderful that it makes it all very very worthwhile.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:27.320
Now I've seen you on tracks--rainy tracks, smoky tracks, sunshiny tracks--and you usually very calm regardless of what's happening. The respect that you engender from your athletes is very notable. Like, I notice athletes are very careful about the way they use language--

Joe Yancey 00:21:47.901
[crosstalk] Well, I don't allow profanity--definitely not, not in the New York Pioneer Club.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:53.771
--because Joe won't let it happen! Now, how can people like you--and in a sense, people like myself--generate the type of enthusiasm and commitment on the part of Black youth and those white youth who want to join us? To the extent that we can maintain this tradition of people participating to do the best they can without necessarily an external reward--doing it because they want to be together. What can you do? What are some of things that I can do? What are some of the things that people in our audience can do to develop the spirit?

Joe Yancey 00:22:30.912
I think it's an individual situation. With me, I've always had a concern for the future of our country. I've always been very interested in people all around the world. It's been a pleasure to talk with people, break bread with them, et cetera, et cetera. I feel that you have to have it within you, it has to be within you, that you're willing to make this contribution to life and you do it freely, openly and you do without thought of any compensation. I mean it's just a beautiful feeling that it gives you that you know that you're doing something and I feel like the--my greatest satisfaction has been to the extent that I've been able to make this small contribution to a better way of life for all of us through athletics and race relations.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:27.580
See, you're one of those quiet revolutionaries [Yancey laughs] and some of the younger people are more overt about this, in a sense you're saying, your own personal commitment, your own personal drive, leads you to feel this way.

Joe Yancey 00:23:43.203
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:43.720
On the other hand, you might look at it another way and that is, that if Black people as a group in our society are going to advance and and keep the advances that they've made, that they're going to have to give more service to their own community. And service should become a byword in the activities of every Black citizen. It doesn't have to be as head coach but it can be some kind of service, in your block, in your community, in your church. And I wouldn't suggest that this is a cliché because it is easily used as a cliché, but I think the Joe Yanceys of the world highlight this. And in your own way through your efforts and through the publicity the testimonial is giving you and your efforts, we're engendering this message which is really larger than Joe Yancey, and that is the message that those of us in the Black community who have talents must serve the black community and of course the world at large. But essentially we have to deal with our own. Is that a philosophy that really comes behind it, or have you really been so busy that you haven't had time to really put it that way--

Joe Yancey 00:24:54.460
[crosstalk] Well, I haven't thought about it. I just got into this situation and, because of my great desire to help people--help young people--and that's been my dedication. I mean, it's nothing else, I have no axe to grind, and as I--as you mentioned before, you know, I'm gainfully employed at the Internal Revenue Service for over 34 years--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:23.360
[crosstalk] You certainly are gainfully, at this time of year, important-- [laughter]

Joe Yancey 00:25:29.080
[unintelligible]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:30.670
Let me ask another question, which doesn't directly relate to the Pioneer Club but it does relate to track and athletics. It has been suggested by some that the emphasis on competition between countries, between nations, in the Olympics is a negative force. That the athletes really should come together regardless of national affiliation and not wear national colors and not have the national anthem played, et cetera. How do you feel about that?

Joe Yancey 00:25:59.320
Well, I don't agree with that. I've participated in six Olympic Games, and I feel that-- they're not completely correct the way they're organized but I think they do a marvelous job and they do a great job. I've been in the Olympic village for these five or six Olympic Games and I've seen the way the young people get together--their camaraderie, the friendship, their fellowship--and how well they get on. And I think that they do a great job. They make friends with each other. And I think the Olympic movement, with a few corrections here and there, is a great movement and will survive. I think so.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:48.130
I think it's with the spirit of people like Joe Yancey that is going to survive if we are able to deal with some of these excesses. I'd like to mention to our audience that those who are interested in participating in this salute to Joe Yancey, should contact the Joe Yancey testimonial committee at the Statler Hilton Hotel, suite 600A. Or else call 244-5840, that's 244-5840 for information about the Joe Yancey testimonial. I understand a very charming young lady, Joan Kay Harris, is coordinating this and you have a very auspicious committee--

Joe Yancey 00:27:29.651
Definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:29.653
--all types of folks who work with you--Lorenzo Buck, Herb Douglas, Meredith Gourdine, Ed Mosley--Andy Stanfield and William Blakely, who've been working on this and it really should be a fantastic success.

Joe Yancey 00:27:44.561
Well, I hope so. [laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:48.071
As you look to the future, what do you really hope happens as a result of the activities of the Pioneer Club?

Joe Yancey 00:27:54.040
Well, I hope that the Pioneer Club can continue to go from strength to strength--and carry on--doing the job that we've been doing for the upward of thirty nine years in the field of amateur athletics and race relations.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:08.920
That's a beautiful way on which to close our show. Thanks to Joe Yancey for being our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Joe Yancey 00:28:15.311
And thank you very much Roscoe.
