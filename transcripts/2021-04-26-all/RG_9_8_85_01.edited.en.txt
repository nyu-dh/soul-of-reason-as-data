Speaker 1 00:00:01.380
Is the entertainment industry big business? Do black performers get ripped off by business entrepreneurs? How does commercialism affect the performing artist? Here are the answers to these questions. When we talk with James P. Murray, film critic, on today's Soul of Reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:36.510
This is Soul of Reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box. Soul of Reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.

Speaker 3 00:00:55.460
Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:06.101
With us today is James Murray film critic, film editor of Amsterdam News and editor of Black Creation, a quarterly review of Black Arts and Letters. And Jim I know you're very interested in the question of the business aspect of the entertainment industry. I'd like to begin by asking you the question; can the entertainment industry be accused of going after the fast buck?

James Murray 00:01:29.231
I don't think that there's any question about it today. The evidence is certainly overwhelming. There are all types of companies now organized and the efforts that they put in terms of promotion of different acts that they have, different products that they turn out are certainly geared totally towards commercialism as much as anything today as far as any business is concerned.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:53.530
Now when you say the efforts that they put forth are you talking about legal efforts or illegal efforts? Are you referring to the recent Payola scandal? Are you referring to just the crassness of the promotions that occurred, particularly in terms of promoting some of the black films and some of the films that deal with sex and violence?

James Murray 00:02:10.750
Well I have to say that my answer really has to be all inclusive. There are legal aspects of it and I suppose there's no question about some of the techniques that they have used as being illegal. And the current scandal is such that has yet been substantiated in terms of the names that we know are probably going to come once the investigations are completed we'll certainly produce more than adequate evidence that there is a lot of illegal activity done in terms of promoting different aspects of the industry.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:44.990
Of course many people who relate to the entertainment business say well yes it is a business and techniques that are used in the entertainment business are no different than the techniques that are used in other businesses. Probably the only difference is the main difference is that in the entertainment business the property is person, it's a human being, rather than an automobile or steel or corn or what have you. How does this really affect the artist themselves? Are the artists really affected adversely by this commercialism or do they benefit by it?

James Murray 00:03:19.090
Well I think there's a whole sense of perversion that comes out of this type of philosophy in terms of the industry gearing itself up as a business. Any artist as a person who has a great degree or you know some degree of talent which he works a long period of time to develop and of course his whole goal in life is to perform for an audience and to get some type of reaction from that audience to create something that is going to get a response from the people which is also fine well and good. I think if we look at it from an ideological standpoint their ultimate goal would be able to, what would be rather, to create something, present something to the public that would receive the type of, sort of response that would not be necessarily geared in terms of dollars. In other words a performer coming out at the end of the concert and receiving 15 or 20 minute standing ovation or a, a painter having people come and react to his paintings or to his show and being actually moved by what he's created in terms of this painting work. So I think that idealistically artists should at least be much more concerned with having this type of response in terms of some goals that are not necessarily realized in dollars as opposed to making the dollar the ultimate end of his actual work.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:47.801
However if a person as a performer as a film actor or actress he or she has to have roles and has to be received by the public in order to gain a type of acclaim both critical and financial. And then this gets into the question of the type of roles that many actors and actresses are asked to play, particularly in some of the black films. Because you know and you've written about the motif in many of the black films as a motif of extreme action, frequently extreme violence, extreme emphasis on sex, and sometimes extreme emphasis on black white attitudes and some of the roles almost stereotypical in that the black actors and actresses are asked to play roles that really represents a minority of people in the black community and frequently don't have a great deal of dignity. Yet many of our name black actors and actresses have played these roles. Now is this a function of just the commercialism or is this a function of the fact that the people who are making black movies themselves have stereotypic attitudes about blacks?

James Murray 00:05:57.401
Well again I have to say that the answer to your question is as you stated it both two fold. I think that commercialism is certainly a, a part of the problem as you described it and that secondly there is also a problem in terms of people creating. It's often been said that anytime anyone writes a novel a poem or short story that if you read it carefully you can learn something about the author in terms of their attitudes, desires, goals, aspirations and all the rest of it. I think that as you pointed out these stereotypic things that have been certainly flaunted in the movies over the past couple of years are very very blatant types of examples of how commercialism goes. You see it in the music industry when a certain sound is shown and it's very popular. It makes a number one record and immediately you see a number of imitations. You see it in the movie industry, when a certain film works and they go into one two three four five sequels, or as in the James Bond types of films which were extremely successful you see it in imitations like Our Man Flint and any number of different other shit which was a black example of it but it was a formula that worked and it was copied and it will be copied until it's found not to be commercially successful anymore.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:26.310
But to play the role of the Devil's advocate, if entertainment is to make people who see something feel happy and to enjoy themselves, if a sound or record sound comes out that's a hit, what's really wrong with somebody trying to copy it or cover it as they say in the industry? If we have one film that produces a formula that attracts people what really is wrong with this? These are the questions that the business people, the promoters or producers or record company owners ask because they say we are business people, we are here both to entertain people but mainly to make money. And so what's wrong with redoing the same thing, if in fact people like it and they reflect their liking it in buying it.

James Murray 00:08:13.620
Well I think that the answer to that question very simply is that it stifles creativity. I think that there are probably an infinite number of ways that people can be entertained. And when we sit down and copy a certain formula it means that we don't want to take the time or energy or use our creative minds to think of something else that can you know entertain equally as well. So I feel like that's the answer that it just stifles creativity it's an easy way out it's a it's a cop out in the sense of speaking.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:43.650.9999999999418
You've really spoken like a critic. And of course this is your role, to criticize the arts. And what you've done is to say well the arts have a main role of giving people the opportunity to express that feeling creatively. And I sense you've negated the fact that not everyone or maybe not even most people really want to look at things differently. Maybe they just want to hear the same kind of music, see the same kind of films, and what really is wrong with the industry giving this to them?

James Murray 00:09:15.540
I think so. I feel that the, the industry as such can be trend setting as opposed to following supposed trends. It's often stated that virtually everything, at least in movies particularly, is a result of something that someone has seen as the reflection of life. That's the term I think that they like to use. But in your other creative forms you more often notice, particularly in music and books, a lot of people sit down and use their imaginations and do different things and don't necessarily write about something that they've seen on the street as much. And here is where the creativity and the leadership comes in and establishing and setting trends as opposed to just following the whims and the wills of the public which are at best sort of elusive and difficult to try to capture.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:07.560
But what if this creativity causes the industry to lose money?

James Murray 00:10:13.601
Okay. I realize the necessity of everyone to make a living and to survive. And I think that there is a possibility that when artists take a tactic, they are not going to sacrifice their creative desires and goals to make money that there are perhaps problems that will make it difficult for them to survive. And I think the theater groups across the country are particularly in the black community are perfect examples of that who exist almost solely on grants to start out with because they have a certain role that they like to play and they don't want to compromise that role at all and they struggle. However again I would have to say and maybe this is not necessarily the best attitude. I feel that when these people do something that they feel has credibility and expresses what they want to say the way they want to say it and they do get the proper response from the community or their audience. Other than you know amassing large sums of money I think that the rewards for them are much greater than any type of financial richness.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:24.620
Can you give a couple of examples in the film industry or the music industry as to how a creative approach to films or to music has enabled a company to both or an artist both make a creative contribution and also be successful financially.

James Murray 00:11:42.380
Well I think in the film industry the best example thus far has perhaps been Sounder which was I felt the quality film and every aspect of production and it didn't start off commercially doing well but for a number of reasons including I think the attitudes on the part of the people who distribute it and sticking with it and continuing to promote it and to go out and look for a certain audience. The film now has done exceedingly well commercially because I think of the excellent qualities that it had all around which you know some people react negatively because I think they were sort of oriented toward other things but they are, after sitting down and after the film was explained and talked about and praised, enough people went and sat and watched the movie seriously which it needed to be. That's the way it needed to be watched and I think it's one example in the movie industry where a good creative product did reap the financial rewards that it should have. And I'm sure will continue to do when it goes into, if it hasn't already into international distribution.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:49.670
Well what about films like Sweetback which took an entirely different approach toward making films and I believe Sweetback was probably the first to be really successful at least financially as I understand with films. Is this something that is another example of how a person can be creative and financially successful or is that more or less an accident.

James Murray 00:13:17.631
I don't think it was was an accident. I think there are a lot of different ways. A lot of different levels with which you can can deal with this film. There were certain things in there that then people had noticed about, or felt he knew about the black audience. And so too I feel to a certain degree he did go out searching for that audience and use certain things in the film to attract that audience. So, which hadn't been really necessarily done before. So in that sense I think that the way he put it together his concept was new. But a lot of the elements in the film itself were not necessarily those which could be considered all that unique.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:05.020
Well do you see any danger in the fact that many of the studios seem to be making films that are aimed totally at the black audience using idioms using topics using music that seems to appeal almost directly black audience. I was in Florida a couple weeks ago and someone mentioned that the way in which the theatres work is, in the Senate cities where they are predominately black, they bring all the black action films but they can't show or won't show these films out in the suburbs and it's only films like sounder and Lady Sings the Blues that are black films that get out there. Now, this tends to suggest that the filmmaking people are focusing black films on predominantly black audiences in the central cities and in a sense doing business as usual in the suburbs. Now if in fact the film industry is to make an impact in terms of the cultural miscegenation of people and spreading pictures and points of view about different people through the community through the nation or national community, what is the possible impact? Is it going to be a good impact that black films are being oriented especially to black people. Or is it possibly going to be somewhat of a negative or what you might call a feedback?

James Murray 00:15:30.220
Well there's a problem there. And that again basically is that the industry is attacking this entire subject from a purely business point of view and of course it's working very well for them. I think that this attitude is certainly not going to be changed as long as money is coming in so quickly as a result of the films playing where they are. That I would say that regardless of any type of peer group pressure and demonstration that isolated cases and a lot of upwelling some of which certainly as you can see now has not changed the situation at all a year later. So I think what has to happen is that people's attitudes have to be changed because I think we could suggest that, for instance, they need to show Sounder more in the central cities as such and there's no question about it if it's playing at the same time in the same neighborhood as the Mac for instance, that there will be no question about where the people are going to go. But I think that this gesture needs to be made and stuck with until the change comes about at the same time. I think there has to again been a movement on the part of community leaders or whoever to start dealing with the attitudes of the people and showing them in whatever way is possible that exploitation is taking place and that there are alternatives that they do have to continue going to these exploitation films which I'm sure they will. I mean the situation is hardly going to change overnight. It's going to take a while. That there are other things that can give them at least as much enjoyment or we'll put it this way entertainment, and that's going to take a little bit of a while to get done.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:19.800.9999999998836
Because some people are saying that it's good that they are black films that are oriented mainly to the blacks and reflect a lot of the soul culture of the blacks particularly the lower income blacks in your central cities and some middle income blacks in the Central cities. They're saying this is good. This gives us a chance to do our thing and as a result does have a cultural influence. Is this really a chicken egg question? Is it that now that the films are there we are trying to justify them and give them value to them because they're there or is it really true that the films do reflect a significant amount of black culture and black people really want to see this and really want to relate to this?

James Murray 00:18:08.850
I think black people, the ones that go to see these films, really want to see them and they are really entertained but I doubt very seriously if there is much in terms of cultural benefit given to the audience as such I just sort of felt like -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:24.621
Cultural - I meant speaking cultural in the highbrow sense of understanding one's heritage a longtime back and looking at things more esoterically. I'm thinking of culture and just in terms of expressing the way life is. Is it - I guess I'm really asking the question Is it really true that life in the black community is exactly like it is in these films or are these films taking a slice of life and in a sense saying this is the black community?

James Murray 00:18:49.530
Well that's certainly an interpretation that you can get that you know these films epitomize life in the black community which is certainly hardly the case. There are just so many aspects and facets that they can't possibly be covered. And when so many things are emphasized so much for someone who is alien to the community as such they would get the impression that certain things in terms of violence in terms of even some conversations and sayings really represent the way it is in the community which is just not true. I mean that taking the things that work most effectively, the things that audiences respond most to, and using them over and over and over again. And that certainly is not reflective of the total spectrum of the black experience in any sense of speaking.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:37.862
Well, do you think that the infusion of more black writers and directors might help to change this? The thing that I've noticed is that so many of these films which reportedly relate to the black community are in fact created and written by white writers. Not to say that a white writer can't in some instances reflect some aspects of black life but when practically all of them end up being created by white writers and many of the stereotypes even the so-called super negative stereotype that is generated in them in a sense could be dangerous to black people themselves if they begin to believe them too seriously. And I guess it is possible that if we have more black writers and producers and directors maybe things will change. And do you think this is a possibility and if so what do you think the probabilities of this coming through?

James Murray 00:20:34.171
Again over a long term perspective, I would say yes that it is true but it's already been shown in cases of black screenplays and black properties as such. Even black directors who don't have the final cut in the film. That still problems will arise and those who see a rough cut of the film or an? print of the film see things that they don't like or they object to, if they're putting up the money of course they're going to say no we want this, make this change, we demand that this be changed or we will refuse to release the film which puts the creative people in a compromising sort of position and they usually end up relenting to this type of demand. So all I'm saying is that writers are important directors are important as much as the people on screen. But those who have the final answer can also influence greatly what the final result of the film would be, even if the right things are done in terms of the way it was shot and the way it was directed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:35.390
Do you really think that a film company would refuse to release the film if in fact a prestige director objected very strenuously to making certain changes?

James Murray 00:21:47.090
I think so. I think that it gets to be a point that - I don't think that the film will never be released, I think that the thing will get into all types of litigation and it might be delayed as long as perhaps even up to a year. And there are cases where I don't know if I use the word Prestige director as such but people who have had long careers in the industry have gotten into disputes about you know certain aspects of the film or other films and just said you know I want this in or it doesn't go. Of course they negotiate back and forth and ultimately it's resolved one way or the other but I think yes, they would put their foot down and say you know it's our way or no. And it would ultimately be resolved even if it took an extended period of time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:32.420
And sometimes they do replace directors. Oh yes. Right. When they really get off on the wrong track. Do you think black performers get ripped off more by the business entrepreneurs than white performers?

James Murray 00:22:46.430
I think there proportionally are probably cases of this happening more with performers who are black primarily because just as anyone who is new in the business they are just not aware of all the sophisticated techniques used in accounting and different ways that you can use to get yourself a good living. There are people who are advisors in all sorts of capacities who are probably not necessary who have exorbitant fees and I mean I think the cases are innumerable of people in not only the artistic world but even the athletic world who just didn't know what to do with a large sum of money that came to them all at once. Well yes. I think that there is certainly a degree of truth in that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:34.290
What's the ideal balance between commercialism and art and creativity in the whole world of films and arts?

James Murray 00:23:44.720
I think that what I would like to see is just for artists to realize again as I think a few of them do now that their creativity and the response of the audiences in terms of just coming out and supporting them is much more important. And should be their ultimate aim or end as opposed to making a lot of money. I think that the two could certainly work together. If you have a good product and it is effective in reaching an audience the audience is going to respond and if they come and see you or that they buy your records you're certainly going to reap financial rewards. But I just don't think that that should be the all important aim or goal of an artist because their work is just you know a lot more different than other people who are, you know, just sound business.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:42.360
But if you get to it. The attraction for many of the youth who organize singing groups in the ghetto, music groups many who go to acting school. The attraction is to make money. It's just like many of the kids in the ghetto who play basketball. Even though basketball is fun and so on the amount of effort and time they put into it is based on the fact that some of them think that that's a more effective way to success and success in essence being big money. And I really wonder just how strong the so-called artistic theme or the creative theme is in the lives of many of our performers.

James Murray 00:25:24.170
It is and I think that this is certainly borne out of the fact of the really hundreds of groups who come up and make one hit record and well some of them sometimes they have hits and they'll have a number one record and then you don't hear from them anymore. I mean the all the glory and all of it and this type of thing I think fame is certainly another important aspect of you know idealistic kids, you know having girls screaming at them, this type of thing. But all I'm saying is that they'll have a record they'll you know sing for a year and then dissention will rise or somebody will get disinterested and you know it's very obvious that their music not the most important thing. All the jazz artists who have suffered for years and continue to do so barely making, are the epitome I think of people who are really dedicated to their music and who have made music their lives as opposed to these kids who have all these altruistic goals in terms of you know a quick hit and then that's the end of it as far as their career's concerned, they give it up.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:27.520
Well again this gets back to this conflict between art and business. Do you think art will ever be art again and entertainment will ever be entertainment again?

James Murray 00:26:38.350
Well I think it's sort of doubtful now looking at the situation the way it is. There are always going to be a certain number of people who are going to take their work very seriously. They probably will never become very famous or very rich for it. But in terms of getting you know accomplishing personal goals that they have I think they will. But the way it looks now the overwhelming majority of people will continue to just you know make money. Their all important goal.

Speaker 3 00:27:09.340
Of course, on the other hand, not quite as pessimistic as you. I do think that in almost every industry a certain number of people who have great talent do rise to the top. And we would hope that through the type of dialogue that you and I are indulging in and I know critics indulge in in their publications with the public and with the artists we will be able to generate the type of orientation to the arts that you are seeking. And I'd like to thank you Jim Murray, film critic of Amsterdam News and editor of Black Creation, for being with us today and leading us through this may years. And that's exactly what it is, of business and business practices and the effect of these practices on the entertainment industry both in films and in music.
