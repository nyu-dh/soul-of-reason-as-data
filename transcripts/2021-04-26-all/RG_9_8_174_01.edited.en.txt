Distinguished guest voicing the black experience. 00:00:22.180
This is Soul of Reason. A program that will examine the roots of the black box thot soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:00:48.520
Do you know that only 15 percent of the 560,000 pupils who are eligible for free school breakfasts in New York City are receiving them. Tonight on Soul of Reason we will meet Kathy Goldman and James Hill of the New York City school breakfast committee to discuss this important problem and glad to have you with us tonight, Jim and Kathy.

Kathy Goldman 00:01:10.472
Thank you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:01:11.470
This is really some statistic I just never was aware of the fact that so few of the children who are eligible for free school breakfasts are getting them. And Kathy maybe we can begin by putting this problem in some type of context.

Kathy Goldman 00:01:27.800
Okay we'll try. First of all I must tell you that we feel that the 15 percent is a major victory because prior to 1975 there were less than 10 percent of the children who are eligible eating. I would like to comment that on a couple of things just in general background one is that this is a federal program basically that it is heavily funded by the federal government and the State Government and it functions under the Child Nutrition Act which was passed in 1975 and it is a program that is not only for poor children. It recognizes the desperate need for breakfast for most of the children in the United States who do not eat breakfast. Believe it or not. Only one out of five kids eats a really nourishing breakfast in this country. It's the forgotten meal.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:02:18.930
Why do you think that is this. Before we get to this program why do you think it is that so few people eat breakfast and this applies to adults as well. What do you have for breakfast. Let's say last morning you went to work Jim.

Kathy Goldman 00:02:29.940
You better give the right answer hand.

James Hill 00:02:33.630
Well I had an orange and a Danish.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:02:39.430
Well ever and that's about C minus on the breakfast care where do you last a human to work.

Kathy Goldman 00:02:45.570
I had I'm at work today it's all grapefruit juice and some coffee.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:02:52.460
OK. All right. That's a C minus

Kathy Goldman 00:02:54.154
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:02:54.840
So we have a situation where all of us have breakfast problems. Now the federal legislation is aimed at children to be certain that schoolchildren have adequate breakfast.

Kathy Goldman 00:03:06.870
It's a very complicated creative problem. Actually why you're asking a very good question why our lifestyle has really changed most of us get up in the morning at different times it's no longer the farm family that is sitting around the table whenever at the crack of dawn or after they finish milking the cows you know they've come back in and have a hearty breakfast or and it's not Ozzie and Harriet either it's just not the real life situation you have parents that fly out the door at 6:00 in the morning kids that fly out the door to go high school at six thirty in the morning and other person that goes out at seven. That's really the reality of how we live today.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:03:41.910
And many offices actually have breakfast breaks the so-called coffee break in many places is a breakfast break in some offices are trying to encourage the use of fruit and protein because the deficiency in the breakfast both of you mentioned is that there's no protein in the breakfast and in school breakfast with the menus that are available they usually have some kind of protein.

Kathy Goldman 00:04:03.620
There there's at least milk. So that will cover a great deal of the problem. But I'm really glad you mentioned the whole question of coffee break or in many unions have a you know really a a morning 15 minute period off and yet the children. And just for one moment if I can speak slightly nutritionally let's assume that a child goes to sleep about 8:00 or 9:00 the night before doesn't have anything as he flies out the door in the morning or has very little or grabbed something that really is not nutritious. But there are maybe 12 hours have elapsed between the time that child has had something to eat and the next morning when they could have breakfast again and the body's blood sugar level is very low by that time. And the whole combination of events that happens so that kids really you are in. We're not talking about malnutrition here we're just saying they're uncomfortable they're restless they just can't get it together in the morning sometimes when they haven't had anything and while they're adult you know the members of their family might be able to take their coffee break they have no place to go.

James Hill 00:05:11.220
You know one of the most important piece of information I got was yesterday morning when my son came in with a slip of paper saying that he was going to take the reading test and one of the things that the principal advise is that on this morning the child should eat breakfast cereal.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:05:31.260
I said the words they want to get test scores up they want the kid to be perfectly comfortable ready to go by any other money doesn't make that much difference but that's got back to what I consider to be a shameful statistic. This is basically a free program. Am I correct in that that most of these children are eligible for free breakfast this 560,000 children.

James Hill 00:05:50.960
Yeah. Especially if you look in that particular district that they're in you know because the districts change like the districts in Queens maybe the majority of the folks might be they might be legible for a reduced breakfast. Or like let's take District 13 for an example. There's 22 schools. The majority of the 22 schools like 21 of the schools are eligible to have a free breakfast one of the schools they would most likely have to pay because of the economic stability of the parents in particular.

Kathy Goldman 00:06:29.060
Actually it's a year it's done the same way a school lunch. Each child's eligibility is based on the income of the family and children are eligible for either free if their family income is below a certain level or reduced price in which case they would pay five cents a breakfast or paid in which case they would pay 35 cents of breakfast and I would like to stress again that is not only a poor kids problem it might be the most what our statistics are being given based on the free number of children giving eating free lunch which gives us a good idea of the number of kids that would be eligible and about 550,000 and more are eating or are eligible for free lunch. There are more children that are eligible for reduced price and paid of course.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:07:19.500
And that would encompass practically everyone in the schools. Would it not if we get to that particular position where between the free lunch and the subsidized lunch wouldn't that encompass 80 and 90 percent of the children in the public schools at this point.

James Hill 00:07:32.970
Definitely one of the things that last last Monday Richmond had a hearing on school lunches and one of the things that they said was 10 years ago 41 percent of the children in the city were eligible for a free lunch and today ninety one of the 91 percent of the kids eligible for this free lunch are the majority in terms of black and Puerto Rican people. You know so one of the things that was kind of like getting me upset because I'm a former school teacher and I was saying to myself the attendance the ratio the type of people is changing in the city. And when you have the large influx of black and Puerto Rican kids in the school system and 91 percent of them eating this free breakfast I said it seems to me that things seem to be changing up all of a sudden in terms of the rules. I don't know if I'm making myself clear but I'm saying that maybe. Well a lot of things have been said in a different district said really got to me like in one particular district. One lady said to me Well you know you feed these kids breakfast then you're going to feed them lunch and then you're going to feed them them dinner. And those welfare people run around in the ghetto they're riding around in Cadillacs and they want us to provide everything from for us and then it's going to take away from their instructional time. And I said to myself I wonder why they're saying that you know and I said I knew that I couldn't get personally involved in that situation. But as a black man it got me kind of upset because I said to myself she she's she's putting too much pressure on the whole black situation. And if you look in middle class neighborhoods you see a lot of restaurants in those neighborhoods and a lot of those people are eating breakfast in the morning so that means that not only black people need breakfast in the morning and not only black people are stuck with the situation that they're the only ones that really don't sit down on the table in the morning and eat breakfast. So that kind of really got to me.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:09:42.140
In other words you're suggesting that part of the reason at least in your opinion for the less than aggressive pursuit of spreading this program to people who are eligible is the fact that the people who are administering it in the schools tend not to really promote it because they don't think that schools should be doing this.

James Hill 00:10:02.000
I think they had the same some of the same attitudinal reasons that some of the worst bigots against the breakfast program have you know and like that my problem was that I couldn't find the like being the coordinator of the breakfast program. I went out looking for the bad guys and the good guys. I couldn't find them you know and then or I

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:10:22.980
You mean you couldn't find any good guys or you found only all bad guys back.

James Hill 00:10:26.430
I didn't know who was who until I ran into the bureau school lunches and when I ran into the bureau school lunches and found out one of the basic questions that I had was how many kids are eating breakfast daily. And we needed those participation. So because this program is 100 percent reimbursable and you need those figures and they weren't unable to produce those figures then the figures that they produce they didn't coincide with the district. And then it just seemed to me that they weren't really putting any pressure on having a viable Breakfast program. So I just had to use them as the bad guy but then just checking out or catching up to the Bureau school lunches how such a chain of command and such a bureaucracy that you can't finger one person for doing this so you just have to say it's a whole attitude problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:11:14.460
Of course the whole business of providing meals breakfast in particular has become a national scandal in some places and I think it's interesting. Put this into some historical perspective. Back in the late 40s the late 80s Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Junior who was a representative from Harlem at that time initiated what it was called the Powell amendments and one of the Powell amendments dealt with the school lunch program that unless the school lunches were made available to black children in the south no one would get them. And that's what led to the revision of the old school lunch law which said that if one group of pupils are eligible every group of people of similar second class is eligible and you do have this really deep philosophical problem in our society related to not only breakfast programs which relates to free hospital care. It relates to welfare subsidized housing that somehow or another because of certain administrative excesses and basic racism and classism. The people who often run these programs tend to be hostile to the very people that they're trying to serve. And Kathy I know you had mentioned this before the we began the discussion on the program. To what extent do you feel that the the top echelon of the Board of Education and of the state school lunch bureau really wants this to move. Now you talked about the people in the trenches that they are sort of recalcitrant but to what extent are the people at the top and what extent does the board of education to what extent does the superintendent the director of high schools do what it said that they want the program to work.

Kathy Goldman 00:13:01.200
Well in in some kind of line of authority I think the state is very supportive of this program it just so happens and I think the state Education Department does support it very very heavily. The breakdown happens at exactly where you put it at the level of the Board of Education. It's unclear to me in. In theory the L.A. Board of Education supports the program. I mean they have accepted it made a statement and so forth. But the reality of how their staff carries it out is quite the reverse. And as Jim has been saying and you've commented so absolutely correctly this thing has you know we're saying here that they are trying to make parents feel as if they are doing something wrong if they are not supporting if they're not providing their children with breakfast in the morning and yet we're not providing them with the jobs so that they can go out and buy the food would not support giving them the kind of a.. I mean the family structure has broken down and it can hardly be blamed on the individual family. We're saying while we fix all this in the meantime you've got to feed these kids just a couple of other comments as we got into some history. They're really the first breakfast program in this city was started by the Black Panthers and some people even feel that it was only because of the success of that program which fed kids on their way to school in various centers that these schools that the government realized that something was going on and that they began this program and second of all you mentioned the whole question of. And Jim raised the question of the whole stigma that is felt by many people in terms of people on welfare and people on food programs but who really gets the subsidies in any of these programs. Every meal that's served to a child in the United States of America I at lunch or at breakfasts whether it's paid or unpaid has to have a half pint of milk with it or the government does not pay back that subsidy. Now I may think it's perfectly good for the kids to have milk. Those who can happen to digest it. But the fact is that that's the milk lobby's Bill not mine. And while many of us feel that it is an unholy alliance and in terms of the big business but the fact is that if I were to give you the list of commodities that's available right now you would it find that peanut butter is very available that peanut oil is available that peanut shortening is available and that peanuts are available And

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:15:31.840
this happened before President Carter was elected.

Kathy Goldman 00:15:33.900
Well it's certainly increased since he was elected. Now why I agree with that stories it happened beforehand. But I'm saying that's just a very graphic example of the large scale agricultural interests that support these programs. And that's if you want to talk about who really gets subsidized that's what really gets subsidized not some kid that's getting 45 cents worth of breakfast.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:15:58.580
All right well now let's go into now. What is your committee is doing. You're with The New York City school breakfast many Kathy Goldman Europe committee member.

Kathy Goldman 00:16:09.761
Yes I am.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:16:10.330
And Jim Hill your staff members.

James Hill 00:16:12.990
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:16:13.960
And you've taken upon yourselves to bring this to the attention of the public. And one of the avenues you're using is coming to solar Soul of Reason and I guess you go to other radio programs and other community forums. What specifically are you doing. You have established the fact that breakfast is needed that it's a right that it's basically subsidized doesn't cost the city any money. How do you go about now getting more and more of these children who are eligible to avail themselves of these free breakfast.

James Hill 00:16:48.520
Well let me say when I first started I made a lot of real big mistakes because I was going in and trying to clarify things that I really had no power in. For example let's take District 19 District 19 I have a food committee and then they have the PTA presidents council at the PTA presidents council the PTA presidents of each particular school the food committee are what we might term an insurgent group. OK the PTA president council majority the majority is black. The food committee the majority is Puerto Rican. OK now food or the breakfast program was not really a high priority issue. So what I found myself doing was I was trying to publicize the breakfast program and I was trying to motivate the food committee to be an advocate of the breakfast program. You see if we can get it in and then when I went and talked to the PTA presidents council I found out that they were in agreement with it also. But what they were divided over was over the personalities in terms of the two different groups. And then I said to myself you know Jim you're really wasting your time. And a lot of these things you know. So what you really should do is you should try to get the information off to the children. So what I did was I started to do ups and put posters and some publicity and I and I put it into the community centers because I said Here's where the children can really get to see and then another thing is that we're working on getting out some publicity in the trains because our ally or our most important as far as I'm concerned is that working mother because a lot of people have said a lot of different things and I know in my own beginnings in the breakfast program I was a little leery like Kathy Goldman she she'll tell you that her interests first was was in this food idea and working around nutrition nutritional programs. But I was a teacher and I taught for six years and I got laid off and I was out here and I was looking for something and when the breakfast committee first approached me I don't know whether I was really that interested in the breakfast program because I had some of the same misgivings that a lot of us had in terms of what is this another trick by some white liberals to break up the black family structure. And I went along that line you know and I was thinking you know and then I got into and I really saw what it was all about. And I think now more than anything else my major job is to try to break down the stigma. You know this is not a poor people's program. You know this is a program for all people you know and if they're going to stigmatize black and Puerto Rican kids you know for eating breakfast and they've got to stigmatize all kids because all kids should have this breakfast you know and then so. So my thing is again is I'm going to try my best to continue to get out the information in the community centers and try to get the information into the schools and try to deal with information on the trains you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:20:05.390
Now I understand the law that was passed by the state legislature in 1975 requires all schools to make this program available to children. And I believe that the law further states that if a certain proportion of the children don't avail themselves of the breakfast program they don't get the support for the lunch program. Is that correct Kathy?.

Kathy Goldman 00:20:26.250
I think No. No that's a yes to the first notes and secondly the there have to be a certain proportion of the children eligible in order for the mandate to have to be in effect. It was a very important change that required school districts to have to have this program to mandate the program because they were not doing it voluntarily. We would have been perfectly happy to let it go was a voluntary program if they were doing it but they wouldn't. And when I say they I'm saying whoever was in charge of districts and so forth. One of the major jobs of the breakfast committee is to try to counter some of the misinformation that has been so widespread. And that is not being helped by the Bureau school lunches. And the Board of Education. And so we are available to districts to help them work out budgets to help them look at the actual course and so forth. Now that you see the lunch is not is as you said before because of the power legislation is not affected by this. They could threaten them but that really is not realistic and we would certainly hope that that nobody would take on such a threat. But the important thing is that in order to do the breakfast program all districts are supposed to have started by January of this past year. About 10 of them as far as we know either have not or we have no information on those districts that put in the program. We ourselves at a meeting yesterday found about 10 to 15 thousand children that had not been eating before and that's the big issue to us. That's the reason for this bill. Unfortunately there is a move in Albany to repeal this mandating legislation and we're very afraid of it because again they didn't do the program voluntarily even with the law. They are dragging their feet and many of the districts haven't started or have started a very reluctant Breakfast program. You know when they feed the kids only cold cereal and milk and juice in the middle of a kind of cold winter that we had. You know that they're not exactly trying to knock themselves out to get anybody to come in there. Another district that's doing waffles and pancakes and hot cereal all for the same money. That's I. And this is all over the city that you can get this and they've got 50 percent or 65 percent in the case of some districts of their kids that are coming in to eat. No wonder they're coming in that you come in and I come in. But we are not going to walk in through the snow to get to a cold box of Corn Flakes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:23:00.540
Well again you're suggesting that there's some villains in this picture suggesting that some of the villains the people in the bureau school lunches. Are you suggesting that there some villains in some of these school districts. Now the bill states that the schools must notify the parents that their children are eligible and must to me means that they have to do it and if you don't do it something happens to them further. You saying that the districts must operate the program. Yet you just said that some 10 districts that they about aren't running the program.

Kathy Goldman 00:23:32.132
Well we knowWhat can in John Q. Public book and what can you know John Jones and Mamie Smith do to get this program moving because that's one of the purposes of your committee. But we'll talk about how they can hook up with your committee in a minute but give me some examples of what the districts can do what the parents can do to get this program moving. Yeah we. You're very correct. We do place the blame on the Board of Education. We are less. We're a little more reluctant to place the blame on the community school boards because they have been so misinformed that many times they make their decisions based on fear of losing money not they're you know not because of their attitude. And then there are many superintendents and principals who as Jim has said have attitudinal problems. If a parent the first thing is a parent should check does their school have a breakfast program. If not they should certainly instantly ask the principal why not if they get no satisfaction and by that I mean if they're not assured that they'll have them by tomorrow morning then they should get hold of one of their community school board members and there's elections coming up. Community School Board elections on May 3rd. We're hoping that this is an issue school breakfasts should be available and those people we're hoping that the people who get elected to the community school boards are supporters of school breakfast. So it's certainly an optimum moment for parents to ask those people who are running what do they think about this and what are they going to do about it if they are elected.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:25:01.590
Now you did say also Jim that if parents got in touch with the New York City school breakfast committee that you would give them some assistance in terms of how to help schools to administer the program to get good breakfast. Because I know sometimes these good people say we can't do this because there's a lot of paperwork and you've just pointed up that there is money for administration and it doesn't have to cost the school anything. The whole program can be reimbursable. So could you tell us first of all how parents can get in touch with you both the phone number and your address and then what are some of the things you would do with them.

James Hill 00:25:40.380
OK well first of all again My name is James Hill and our phone number is 7 7 7 1 8 3 0. And our address is 225 Park Avenue South. And the zip code is 1 0 0 0 3 and that's New York, New York. And I think again Kathy mentioned the most important thing and that's the misinformation. The first thing when one would call we would mail them immediately information on the breakfast program. Because from what I've seen in the different districts like the PTA is supposed to be the head of the parents. And when you see a principal or superintendent just just just just really controlling that PTA in such a way that they're giving them the wrong information for example when a particular district the superintendent told the parents that they can only get their breakfasts through the Bureau school lunches. And that's not true you know. And he the bureau school lunches serve the service the kids the majority of a cold breakfast. Now in other districts where you see them going through certain vendors and and changing the menus and parents can really play a part in making up the type of menus that their particular district likes. You know you got to really really get into that because the districts are so different and. And if I if I might like I I I was really angry at the fact that they were serving the kids cold breakfast and I said and that's the reason why the participation is really not coming through and then I went into another district district 13 and P.S. 287 and I saw the kids. There was a crowd there you know eating the cold breakfast but it was the fact that the principal was for the program. You know so I said to myself well I really can't stereotype anything you know because some kids were really into the sugar coated cereals and they liked it and they was there you know and my son for one you know Dad I had to go. I said oh wow you know because here I'm fighting one situation saying stop the coal breakfast but again the parents should call us we'll send them a package we'll give them information we'll tell them what is the school breakfast program for who pays for the breakfast. Who is eligible to eat. Why should the school be mandated to offer breakfast. Who is responsible for the implementation and everything.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:28:08.270
All right. I think you've really articulated very clearly what the issue is and how parents and people in the community could deal with it those in the audience who want to pursue this important issue should contact the New York City school breakfast committee that the 225 Park Avenue South. NEW YORK NEW YORK 1003 or call 7 7 7 1 8 3 0. That's 7 7 7 1 8 3 0. As for James Hill our guest on tonight. So the Soul of Reason has been Kathy Goldman and James Hill of the New York City school breakfast committee. And we're going to get more of those kids details to eat those breakfast. Thank you again.
