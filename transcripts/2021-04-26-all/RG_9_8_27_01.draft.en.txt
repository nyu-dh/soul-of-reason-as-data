Speaker 1 00:00:01.370
This is Soul of reason a program that tells what's happening in black America. Each week on NBC leaders and movers in the black community visit soul of reason to discuss issues of concern to black New Yorkers. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York.

Speaker 2 00:00:23.990
And with us this evening on solar reason our Arthur bond president of the Urban Coalition. And Reverend Frederick Denard executive director of the Harlem interfaith counseling service. And tonight we're going to talk about a very important problem and impinges on black New Yorkers and all New Yorkers. Glad to have you gentlemen with us this evening. Great to be here. Well Reverend Renard Fred could you begin and tell our audience exactly what the purpose of what you call Hicks the Harlem interfaith counseling service is.

Speaker 3 00:00:55.310
Yes as a family mental health clinic located in the middle of Harlem. Our purpose is to work with our people and it has to do with any problems that they have concerning mental health and spiritual problems. All of us sometimes are confused about what's going on in our lives and we need somebody to talk to about that.

Speaker 1 00:01:17.780
Who doesn't the president of the United States to be little help if you want to come. I think we use the term confused.

Speaker 4 00:01:26.360
The problems of the world are really so complex today absolute that everyone really needs some type of interactive service. Now how old is the Harlem interfaith dialogue.

Speaker 5 00:01:37.880
It's been eleven years old got started in September of 1966 that's a long time for community service and it's always been located at 215 West and you know we used to be located at 110 East 220 Fifth Street.

Speaker 4 00:01:51.290
We moved uptown little by about the block that in 1971 we moved. I see. All right now what kind of people do you serve. How many of them do you serve. What kind of services.

Speaker 5 00:02:03.410
OK. We serve all kinds of people. Starting of course with the with adults who are having family problems or problems at work or in any kind of problems of that kind. We also serve adolescents adolescents who are in trouble with the courts adolescents who are having problems in school behavior the whole gamut of things. So it really is an entire family service. I would say we served a total at this particular time of about 750 persons altogether. How many families is that represent all that were present I should say about about about 150 families.

Speaker 4 00:02:44.180
And in order to do this what kind of staff do you have. What kind of psychologist yes scientists social workers.

Speaker 5 00:02:49.730
Right. We're very fortunate. First of all we have a clinical director a full time psychiatrist not that unusual and a volunteer. I mean I think that you know that's highly unusual in addition to that we have two part time psychologists and then we have about eight psychiatric social workers some remedial educators and some remedial assistance and then of course we have our fiscal staff and our clerical staff.

Speaker 4 00:03:15.500
And then myself as a clinical pastoral counselor and nurse it says in title Harlem interfaith counseling service excuse me in that it has some relationship to the clergy or to the religious field in some way. Is this the way it got started or is it always partially supported.

Speaker 5 00:03:33.830
How does it come about. In 1966 Bill we were established. It was the ministerial Interfaith Association in connection with the institutes of religion and health that was called American Foundation at that time. They were the ones who decided that that kind of service was needed in Harlem until they got it started. But in addition to that of course we have several ministers that are on our board. But the one thing that I think is unique again about our service is that we take the psycho spiritual approach that does not mean we passed it as people. It does mean that we understand that everybody particularly in Harlem have a spiritual dimension. They go to church and not know what we're talking about but there is a spiritual dimension in our lives.

Speaker 4 00:04:19.579.9999999999709
That's an interesting articulation or rapprochement you're trying to make between organized religion and organized psychiatry because in the early days of psychiatry there was in some instances sort of a war between the theological people and the people involved in religious pursuits and those in the psychiatric pursuits.

Speaker 6 00:04:39.860
Yes. And particularly in terms of the black community the church really is part of the extended family. Whether one is religiously inspired or not or theologically motivated the church has such an important social organizations role in the black community and probably represents the largest movement of people into some organized structure. And one of the problems that goes back all the way to slavery and if we read Professor Herbert Goodman's book the black family in slavery and freedom you recognize that while the black family had strong ties particularly from his African heritage as they moved through not so much slavery but the latter parts of labor and early reconstruction that these basic nuclear family and extended family units were really torn asunder and another type of social organization namely the extended Black Church began to assume that role so that there is some basis for this rapprochement or interaction you're talking about Arthur bonds as chairman of the urban New York Urban Coalition president.

Speaker 7 00:05:50.710
Given the fact that the economic deprivations and social deterioration is going on so rapidly in a place like Harlem and Bedford Stuyvesant in Bushwick in the South Bronx and so on. Why do you feel that it's important to spend so much of the energy of yourself and Reverend Renard and other people in putting a Band-Aid on the problems of the society rather than putting most of our energies in attacking the root causes which are the economic deprivation and the racial and ethnic prejudice under which so many of our people live.

Speaker 8 00:06:33.850
Well Roscoe I think that that is a very interesting question. The answer must be obvious that is that we must do what we have to do on many many levels. It is the function of the Harlem interfaith counselling service to address the problems within the black community both for adults and for youth as they deal with mental health problems. In a clinical fashion. Certainly we have a need for that and the statistics in that catchment area of central Harlem certainly show that there is a need for psychiatric work and a community based level. The deterioration of the communities that these clients come from is obvious and one need only to walk through the community itself to see the disease and the blight. Now obviously there is a great need for economic development for the increase in jobs and a better education et cetera. However you have the product of this blighted area which are these men and women and youngsters that must be dealt with as they approach a entry into society in a positive fashion. And so while on the one hand work is being done to address the economic problems on the other hand the Harlem interfaith counselling service addresses its work from within the community from within the individual from within the group. Some people say that the behaviors of many people in the black ghettos that we describe as abnormal.

Speaker 6 00:08:09.220
Psychiatric or psych psychopathic really aren't abnormal at all but they are logical adjustments to the society that they face now is the purpose of your study to get these folks to accept the conditions and adjust to these conditions or maybe Fred if you told us a little bit more about the actual type of problems that people face that you're trying to help through the service we'd understand a little bit more about this because on one hand it does sound like we're trying to just say to ease people over and get them over while the world fall down around them.

Speaker 4 00:08:51.630
And I am sure that's not your purpose.

Speaker 9 00:08:53.290
Not by any means but first of all let me start out from a broad perspective. We're not talking about mental illness now. It's not mental illness focused is mental health focused in the first place. It takes strength to walk through that door. The issue is that our people don't recognize how strong they are. Now you've got to recognize that although you I just take a slight issue with using the word Band-Aid because the strongest thing you've got going for you is your mind. As you know Professor. So that in order for us to do anything about what exist in our community and in order to really transcend all of a thing that you've named the goal that we have is our minds. So the Harlem interfaith counseling service exists to help all of us get our minds together because that's where our strength lies. So you know that's really it. You can name a number a problem but we're not interested in labels. We entered it in care and concern and love sure we have psychiatric diagnosis but we say let's say let's take the worst thing you can think of. You take a person who is supposedly psychotic. We say all right you've got a problem. Now when you walk across that street you can wear a big sign saying psychotic in front of you if you want to. But when that light changed red and you start walking across the street you're gonna get your head knocked off unless you recognize that you can function. And you did you can do the thing that you need to do to take care of your life. So it doesn't matter what the label is. But we're trying to do is just tap the strength in our people and to bring it forth so that they can do the kind of thing they need to do.

Speaker 10 00:10:40.310
Well how do people get in touch with the clinic. How do you get people inside.

Speaker 9 00:10:45.010
What are the things that we are proudest Dog Day at the highest level of referral come from other people who have received a service. We've got a license from the State Department of Mental Hygiene. But that's not what really counts. As far as we're concerned. We are validated in that most of our clients come from referrals from other clients so something must be happening that's good. And of course we do have referrals from schools and churches and from courts.

Speaker 10 00:11:11.800
Well with the new policy that allows people from the hospitals and mental hospitals state hospitals in particular to be released to live and work to survive in the community with all of the various stories we read about the tragic circumstances of so many of these people. To what extent will this put more work more pressure on your agency to try to serve these folks. Okay. What are some of things you try to do to help serve them all right in first place.

Speaker 9 00:11:45.370
It puts a lot of pressure on the community at large. I think many mental health professionals aren't facing the real facts. Some of these people really do not want to be out of those state hospitals. They have decided for some reason or another that they would prefer being hospitalized read it and no matter what you do they're going to stick with that. The people who most of them I'm not talking about everybody. Some people need to be out and they can be worked with within the community. But many of these people really do not want to be out. So therefore it puts a burden on the community.

Speaker 4 00:12:20.830
It puts a burden on the agency in that we are working sometimes with people of that kind who are convicted to institutionalization in a way that we know is not going to succeed because they really do not want to be in the community of course this raises a lot of problems that any social agency or group of social planners face that previous institutions and previous patterns of establish of taught people to behave in certain ways. People aren't born criminal. They're not born warning to be in the womb of a mental health center all of their lives. Sure. So we we teach people that not all of a sudden the fiscal crisis comes upon us and you find out how costly mental health services are. They said all right. We know that some people can have justice put everybody or most people out there and let them be taken care of by their own and they set up halfway houses and all kind of various arrangements. And yet as this transition is taking place a lot of people get hurt and the society itself flounders in terms of its judgment. Many of the people who argued for us closing out the hospitals and putting more people in the community are now beginning to argue in themselves that maybe we went too far. Now Arthur is a social leader a leader of a major social action organization in the city. You have to confront is not only the field of mental health but you confront it in the field of health and hospital services in the field of education criminal justice. How do you think society can approach these kind of problems do you think that we depend too much on experts. You think we don't depend enough on experts. You think we have difficulty facing the truth. What makes it so difficult for us to really develop a rational approach to dealing with the problems of society.

Speaker 11 00:14:10.480
I would say yes to all of the caveats within your question. Yes we relied too much and as experts. Yes we don't have we don't seem to be aware of the wherewithal to deal with our problems ourselves. But I think more important than all of those cautions Roscoe is the fact that within our society today we have a myriad of problems that are on the surface and in depth too severe for us to deal with. There is no magic wand that can be waved to give us instant answers to some of these problems. And so we wrestle with them as they have been wrestled with over countless years. And we come to a consensus among ourselves and that is that well you know this is very difficult there's really nothing that we can do about it and therefore we get a rationale to deal with that problematic situation. The cancer continues it goes deeper and deeper and infects others but we then deal in platitudes as we look to survive ourselves without hitting our heads so to speak against a stone wall. I think that I can give you an illustration of how we deal with it at the Urban Coalition. The Harlem interfaith counseling service is one of the New York Urban coalitions projects in that the Harlem interfaith counseling service is on the brink of developing and creating a complex on Mount Morris Park West. The property is theirs the deed for that property the Landmark Preservation buildings is theirs and they have the plans made for a three point seven million dollar complex that will include not only the mental health services that they're now providing but a residence for 24 boys 24 girls adolescents who have been adjudged troubled youth by the courts and referred for residency right there in the community. But the supporting services for themselves and their families and we are seeing this project recognizing the symbolism of the project going way beyond the value the mental health area and of course that is considerable. But looking at it as a symbol of revitalization for that entire Central Harlem community have tried to provide technical assistance feasibility studies and created the wherewithal for a fund development drive that's now underway to raise three point seven million dollars. So that's our relationship with it of course it helps that I have been a member of the board of Hicks for the past nine years and at present I am president of the board of directors also so that we have had a long relationship. We know the value of the program over the past 11 years and we're going to help see that the dream of the creative life management complex becomes a reality for Hicks and for the community.

Speaker 12 00:17:01.950
The complex I gather is called the creative life management complex. That's correct as the complex of houses and apartments. Some physical facilities for rehabilitation.

Speaker 11 00:17:15.839.9999999998836
Well let me give you a little background on that site of the Landmark Preservation buildings there are 11 brownstones on Mount Morris Park West now for the audience to tell us exactly where Marsh Park is.

Speaker 12 00:17:28.500
Mount Morris Park.

Speaker 11 00:17:30.480
Actually the park is now Marcus Garvey Park. But the Street is still Mike Morris Park West. That's one block east of Lenox Avenue. But one hundred and twentieth two hundred and 21st streets it is in a circle and goes will feed into Fifth Avenue. So it's a little detour off of Fifth Avenue. Now those buildings as I said were Landmark Preservation buildings but are in a dilapidated condition to an activist state legislature through the work of state Senator Carl McCall and Assemblyman George Miller. A bill was passed to allow Hicks to buy that property for a minimal amount of money and they have done so and the deed is now in their possession. But between the building of the complex and the use of the property and its dilapidated condition now means a lot of work. And that's why where the Coalition is giving the technical assistance to make that a reality.

Speaker 12 00:18:23.700
Tonight a sole reason we are talking with author bonds who's president of the urban New York Urban Coalition and Reverend Frederick deny it. He's executive director of the Harlem interfaith counseling service. And we've been talking thus far about the role of this very important counseling service in the life of Harlem as a prototypical minority black community. And now we are moving into the general area of urban development and how projects like the creative life and living center with what you call it are trying to help save out our neighborhoods. This brings us back to something you said earlier Arthur and that is that the main resource in these communities right now is a human resource of people who live there. And what we're trying to do is to use what minimal funds we can obtain as sort of a multiplier factor to help show the people that life can be more meaningful and hopefully attract other people to invest in our communities. Now one of the things that I've observed recently in New York we have a lot of these symbolic projects you're talking about one in the South Bronx and we need to create some Department Commerce went over to a brewery in Brooklyn and I was going to be symbolic and now we have this one question I'm beginning to wonder about is are we really just talking about symbols or are we talking about something is going to begin to turn a community around and particularly Harlem which is the prototypical capital of black America maybe the black western world definitely needs them turning around now. How are you Fred. Do you see the role of your agency.

Speaker 4 00:20:08.760
You've already gone beyond the walls of two 15 West 100 25th Street out into the larger community because you're getting a relationship between what happens in people's minds and what happens in the media community in which they live.

Speaker 7 00:20:22.730
Sure.

Speaker 3 00:20:25.040
Now the youngsters that we're going to serve all of it are really leaders in our community. They simply have been using their energy for self-destruction. And for the destruction of their own community but they are extremely creative got good minds drawing bodies. What we want to do is to say to them you can become. And it might sound like a euphemism but I believe we can make it happen. You can become a life management champion. In other words you can become the leaders of our community because you got the stuff you've been using it in a way that might hurt you but you really do have the stuff. That we believe that although it will be a I would call it a demonstration project in the sense that we are going to be only able to serve a maximum of 48 youngsters and their families. And I just want to emphasize we're talking about their families also so that as far as red residential living is concerned we should reach at least 248 people while at the same time we're still reaching at least a thousand people on an outpatient basis. But what I'm suggesting is that if we can help them to get their mind together their bodies together their souls together that they then will really turn this community around in terms of a ripple effect. We found that to happen in our 11 years of work where one person in a family will come in and the next thing we know the whole family is coming in. So you have that kind of rippling effect. It'll be a beginning but it will work.

Speaker 12 00:22:00.020
Now what about the talking about people living in this complex and young people and so on given the economic conditions of our society particularly Harlem is this going to have any kind of bridge to jobs or is it going to be totally subsidized housing in that they're in a sense dependent upon someone else to to take care of the rent and the larger part of the rent. How are you going to build that in one of the criticisms about many of the social palliatives is that they develop as they try to help a problem another problem another one of dependency. Sure.

Speaker 4 00:22:35.600
And unfortunately in the black community and many minority communities there seems to be this great dependence on the state some far removed body to help one at the same time as you begin to develop a certain amount of self-hate because you are in a sense unable to maintain your own destiny.

Speaker 3 00:22:53.720
We believe very strongly in the center of developing people's independence. My general feeling that most of our youngsters are unemployable in the sense that they have not acquired the skills that is necessary for them to be employed. Second of all they have not acquired the kind of attitude that makes it possible for them to believe that they can do it in the first place. So what we're going to do within the framework of our supportive services first of all the one that I'm speaking of now is the creative education educational therapy we're going to be rendering educational therapy you know probably much better than I do many of these youngsters. And they'll be between the ages of 14 and 18 years of age. We'll be reading at third and fourth grade level. So the first thing we've got to do is to bring them up to reading level. And while we're doing that we will be giving them psychological aptitude test to determine the kind of talents that they do have as you also know some of these youngsters will not want to go to college but nevertheless if we can discover what skill they have or what talent they have developed their basic skills and point them in the direction that they need to go vocationally and or educationally then they'll be on their way. But we're going to have to do that first. But a lot of back work to be done that has not been done with our youngsters.

Speaker 12 00:24:20.720
Well in terms of these youngsters I gather that many of them will be youngsters who are out of school if left the school environment and they're in a sense on their own. That's right and what you're proposing is to provide some type of community in which they can live and contribute and learn so they can become more productive citizens and violently.

Speaker 3 00:24:41.480
Absolutely. That is a must because I am myself very very disheartened with regard to promising people something and then when they come out there's nothing there.

Speaker 4 00:24:50.750
All right.

Speaker 11 00:24:51.050
Now Arthur Roscoe let me if I might just for a moment touch on something that you you asked about earlier you talked about the symbolism that we have seen in the black communities throughout New York City and certainly throughout the country and what does that mean are we going to be dealing with symbols and nothing tangible or is that just a beginning or is it just a demonstration. I think that certainly we have to deal with symbols as they represent the objectives of many many people under the most adverse conditions. When we talk about Hicks's project of the creative life management complex and the practically impossible task of raising three point seven million dollars and I noticed you didn't even flinch when I said that so you must think that it is possible to when there was a time where if I were to say that to you a few years ago you would have looked at me as if I was crazy. But inflation does have some value. Inflation does have value but more importantly the symbolism of this complex in that Central Harlem community goes a long way toward the revitalization of that community. You're familiar whether you know it's physically a beautiful community across from a park with brownstone houses. This is where many used to live. That's right. Many of them Landmark Preservation designs so that you know that once a full block of these buildings are rehabilitated that it has that ripple effect on the whole community more importantly than that is that Hicks will be providing a vehicle for fund development for black giving for charity beginning at home which is incumbent upon everyone who receives benefits from an institution to support that institution. Blacks have money for everything. The best houses excuse me the best cars the best clothes the best liquor but they have no money to give and this is an educational process that we're going full speed ahead on as we try to get that message across that we must support our own institutions and we're going to give them that opportunity in supporting Hicks.

Speaker 6 00:26:57.070
You made an interim point and you're right I did hear three point seven million I was flinching because this is the time when our ballplayers like Reggie Jackson and Abdul Jabbar and Julius Erving OJ Simpson are getting contracts that pay upwards of three or four million dollars for their sports career. So black people are accustomed to hearing big figures. The problem is that we haven't been able to collect devised this effort toward helping our own and the area of black giving which we're going to talk about in a program later on this fall is an area which we really need to devote some attention to the the contribution of blacks to our own people our own organizations with the exception of our churches has not really moved along as rapidly as some of our other areas of development. So are there won't you tell our audience how they can give. Who do you get in touch with whom they should call etc..

Speaker 11 00:27:54.220
That's very simple. They should get in touch with the Harlem interfaith counseling service at 215 West One hundred and twenty fifth street. The phone number is 6 6 2 8 6 1 3. There will be facilities there for accepting volunteers and for letting the public know how they can help or they can send a check to 215 West a hundred and twenty fifth Street to the Harlem interfaith kindness because it's tax deductible. It is all tax deductible.

Speaker 12 00:28:21.280
Also some people may want to volunteer both in the fundraising and also in some of your program activities. And again the number for the Harlem interfaith counseling service is 6 6 2 8 6 1 3. And I think this is an excellent opportunity for people to become involved in this. Speaking of that Fred. To what extent are the families who were involved in the interfaith service involved in raising money for this large project.

Speaker 3 00:28:47.380
It's almost as though you read my mind. That's what I was thinking about on Saturday this coming Saturday know sometime sometime recently future right in our very recent future we'll gathering together all of the clients past and present and we're going to say to them what we have been doing where we are going and what other jobs that they can do to help us raise funds. That's what we're going to get many of our volunteers from. As a matter of fact some of the people. Some of the people have already done that and we've already committed ourselves to getting money from ourselves that it's to start. So it's already begun.

Speaker 12 00:29:25.790
That's really beautiful. And again we're talking about the Harlem interfaith counseling service our guests have been off the bonds and Reverend Frederick denied. This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for soul of reason. This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs of New York University in association with W NBC.
