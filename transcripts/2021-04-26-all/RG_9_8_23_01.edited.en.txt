Speaker 1 00:00:01.310
This is Soul of reason a program which explores the thinking of black America how blacks responding to the social aesthetic and political concerns of today's world.  Each week on soul of reason on this station we examine what's happening among black New Yorkers.  I'm Roscoe Brown adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University.  With us this evening on soul of reason is Butler Henderson who is executive director of the Earl Warren legal training program of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.  And we'll be talking tonight with Mr. Henderson about this extremely important program to recruit and train black lawyers.  We're glad to have you with us tonight.  Butler thank you.  Glad to be here.

Speaker 2 00:00:49.370
Now as we were saying before the show you've been with the Earl Warren legal training program for what some five or six years since 1972 and this program was at least initiated and part of its concept by a man we both know and respect.  Dr. John W. Davis who was former president of West Virginia State College at Institute West Virginia and also was an adviser to presidents going back to Roosevelt Truman Eisenhower and Kennedy and Johnson and Dr. Davis is an octogenarian who is very active doing all kinds of interesting things to help get young men and young women into the legal profession.

Speaker 3 00:01:30.830
And Dr. Davis is still very active with our program as a consultant.  Dr. Davis who is 89 years old lives in Englewood New Jersey but he comes to work everyday puts in a full day and last night to remind him that it was time to go home.  That's exactly how active he is and how involved he is in providing legal education for so many black people who in previous years have been denied the opportunity.

Speaker 4 00:01:58.280
Well many people in the audience and many people generally probably don't know the difference between the NAACP and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.  Could you clarify that for us.

Speaker 3 00:02:10.910
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund at one time was an integral part of the NAACP itself.  In 1939 the Internal Revenue Service required the two organizations to become separated.  Each to have its own board of trustees board of directors.  That was when Thurgood Marshall was director counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.  In 1956 I think it was IRS a further required the two organizations to remove persons who served as directors on both boards making the break complete.  That is not to say that the two organizations do not cooperate.  It is to say that the two organizations were compelled by by the United States government to become separate organizations mainly because the legal defense fund itself is an organization that is involved in providing services for the indigent for cases that involve civil rights while the NAACP has traditionally been a lobbying organization and the legal defense fund has been entitled to tax deductible gifts a position which at that time was denied the NAACP. And of course the legal defense fund that through the leadership of Thurgood Marshall and Jack Greenberg that brought about those momentous decisions that improve the quality of life for all Americans most notably the Brown case decision that led to the desegregation of public schools and most recently the decisions on the abolition of capital punishment in our society which again shows that the interest of one segment one minority segment of the society is being oppressed also affects the interests of the larger society.  Even though I think many people in the larger society now talking about revitalizing the death penalty at least the basic prescription because it's cruel and inhuman punishment and the Constitution still maintains I know the court has narrowed the ground somewhat but the landmark work of the Legal Defense Fund in this area still holds and we are still working on that working on that.  You're still working on education you're still working on housing which of course brings us to why the overall Earl Warren legal training program was started.  I'm sure everyone in the audience is aware of the fact that the later Warren was the Supreme Court justice of what was called the Warren court the court that made the unanimous decision to abolish racial segregation in the public schools and in many other of our social agencies.  And it may well be that's why it's called the Earl Warren legal training fund. exactly right.  Right.  Earl Warren was at the program when the Earl Warren legal training program was initiated back in 1972 but the law scholarship program and the need for more lawyers became a part of the legal defense fund as far back as nineteen hundred and sixty three for nearly 100 years.  One black institution bore the brunt of legal education for black students interested in study of law.

Speaker 4 00:05:45.540
That was Howard University under the late Dean Charles Houston.

Speaker 5 00:05:49.320
Right.  And although there were a few black students attending the White law schools scattered all over the country at that time there were no state supported law schools in the South that were open to black people.  And it was through the efforts of the legal defense fund and Thurgood Marshall was director of the fund that some of the doors were open.  And as a result of opening the doors or threatening to opening open the doors.  Some of the states established their own law schools for example Lincoln in Missouri established a law school North Carolina established a law school in South Carolina Texas Louisiana and Florida.

Speaker 6 00:06:36.810
These were law schools open only to black students.

Speaker 7 00:06:41.460
They were opened primarily to keep blacks from going to the White state universities.

Speaker 6 00:06:47.250
And in general did not have adequate resources to provide legal training.  That is right not because that just because they were black or segregated but because of the limited budget and the limited staff and limited academic environment those schools created.

Speaker 7 00:07:02.830
That's right.

Speaker 5 00:07:03.270
They they were really established in order to make sure that the law as they saw it at that time was was enforced but they were not interested in having black students attend the state universities.

Speaker 4 00:07:17.830
The more established law schools in the States so as a result of this particular need I gather that the legal defense fund began to give scholarships to black lawyers because I believe there was an interim in which the existence of these predominantly all black segregated law schools was challenged.  So much so that only a certain number of them remain.

Speaker 3 00:07:43.840
Is that correct.  That is right.  Only North Carolina Central Texas Southern and Southern University have law schools.

Speaker 7 00:07:53.590
In addition to the old Howard University which is still an excellent law.  That's right.  Which is still the main institution.  It turns out more black lawyers perhaps than any other institution in the country.

Speaker 6 00:08:07.420
Now this is a very interesting aside because if I recall correctly much of the emphasis of the Howard University Law School was on civil rights litigation on using the law.  This was really the Houston principle using the law the Constitution to obtain rights for blacks that were to which they were entitled under the 14th and 15th amendment.  Now there's so many black lawyers who are going into other areas identify if I the criticism is that we train black lawyers and all of a sudden they go off and work for the corporations that don't really do much to help the average person in the black community has the situation changed so much that your major function is not to train black lawyers just to deal with civil rights but to get into the entire legal profession.  Or are you still focusing on training lawyers so you have a larger category of lawyers to deal with civil rights.

Speaker 7 00:09:02.170
Well that is the purpose of Earl Warren legal training program.  When we found that in many areas of the South there was no sympathetic counsel available to black people.  One of the approaches used by the legal defense fund to remedy that was to provide law scholarships.  And what we called at that time an internship to focus on the needs of people who lived in areas where there was no black legal counsel available.  In 1963 the first two law students received scholarships from what was then called the Herbert Lehman Education Fund which provided our law scholarships to Harvard legal education fund continues to exist and with another responsibility.  But in 1963 the awards made to the first students who receive law scholarships went to two students who were enrolled at the University of Mississippi in that same year.  We began a program called the internship which is now called the Earl Warren legal training fellowship program.  The difference between the two is this the scholarship program is to provide support financial support for those who want to go to law school.  The Fellowship Program attracted youngsters just out of law school who had a commitment to civil rights in an area where the need was greatest and the first two who entered the internship program now called The Fellowship Program where Julius Chambers who is now president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is president of the Earl Warren legal training program and a distinguished lawyer in Charlotte North Carolina.  The other person was Marian Wright Edelman who spent her internship and early years of her legal practice in the state of Mississippi.  She is now director of children's on an organization that is designed to protect the rights of children.  That is the very beginning.  Since that time 1963 we have funded over 1000 students who have chosen to go to law schools all over the country.  And in addition to the two who entered the fellowship program at that time we have 87 other persons who have gone to areas of the South with a commitment at the outset to practice law in those areas.  These fellows have gone to these areas with subsidies from the legal defense fund from the Earl Warren legal training program the first year they spin with the legal defense fund pursuing a specialty and civil rights law.  We pay them pay them a stipend during that first year and then the next three years when they are committed to go out into the field into this area where the great need for black lawyers still exist.  We pay them a stipend for three years and a diminishing amount by the third year.  They are out in the field.  We expect them to be on their own.  But at the same time they are already committed cooperating attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund which means that if we have a serious case involving discrimination housing.  Brutality criminal cases that command the attention of the legal defense fund these lawyers are on the spot and all of it are available together with about 400 other lawyers scattered all over the country as cooperating attorneys.  So we have built in a new corps of cooperating attorneys to work with the legal defense fund.

Speaker 8 00:13:03.450
I noticed in some of the material that you sent me you differentiate between the legal defense scholars and the Earl Warren scholars now and I understand that the earlier program was not focused on civil rights and the Warren program is focused on civil rights or do they both co-exist at the present time.

Speaker 7 00:13:24.930
Just to change in name prior to 1972 it was the legal defense fund and the Herbert Lehman Education Fund handling these programs.  In 1972 the Earl Warren program encompassed both the fellowship and the scholarship program.

Speaker 8 00:13:41.280
And I noticed in one of the reports I believe it you had prepared you can contrasted the civil rights legal commitment of what you call the scholars and the fellows and you differentiate between the scholars who I guess were in the earlier program and the fellows who were in the Warren program and you present some data that shows that almost half of the fellows have a civil rights practice which includes 25 percent or more of their caseload and only 7 percent of the Scholars which tends to reinforce the earlier point that I made then unless black lawyers like any other lawyers are focused on civil rights just the marketplace will take them away from civil rights and what I gather the main point of the Warren training program is is to focus on civil rights.

Speaker 9 00:14:26.820
I might say that one of the reasons that the fellows have been able to spend as much time on civil rights and to focus on civil rights to the extent that they have is because of the subsidy that has been provided for their practice by the LDF and by the Earl Warren legal training program the scholars go into practice strictly on their own.  As a matter of simply making a living for them the fellows when they go into the practice of law they have under their under their belts not only a years specialty in civil rights law for which they were paid but we help them move from New York to where ever they are going to practice law.  We help them purchase a starter law library.  We help them in the purchase of their office equipment.  At the same time pay them a stipend which is denied the fellows which is denied.  I'm sorry which is denied the scholars the scholars start out from scratch without any support from any organization other than what they can find on their own.

Speaker 8 00:15:39.790
Now I believe that in the United States it might be as many as four or five thousand black lawyers or maybe six thousand is that a reasonable estimate it's under 6000.  So if you have been responsible through your scholarship program for training a thousand or thereabouts of these black lawyers that means that your program is almost totally essential to the development of black in this particular area of professional expertise.

Speaker 9 00:16:10.890
There's no question that there Earl Warren legal training program and the scholarships have made quite a difference.  I'd like to clear up a point on this matter for 1000.  That means that 1000 have been supported of that 1000 are close to seven hundred have graduated and that 1000 also includes those currently being funded.  Father Earl Warren I see.

Speaker 10 00:16:37.860
In any given year I understand that the number of blacks who are added to the pool of black lawyers is not really very great.  It only maybe two or three hundred graduate a year so that again suggests that your fund is providing a significant proportion.  I see that in 1977 in the entering class you have 85 in the entering class so this would tend to suggest that the legal training program is contributing immensely to the increase in the number of blacks in this in this area but still it's minuscule.  I think it's something like 2 percent of the lawyers in this country are black.  Which contrasts with maybe 1 percent of the dentist and 2 and a half percent of the physicians.  Which tends to reflect the inherent racist and oppressive character of our society in terms of upward mobility of blacks.

Speaker 11 00:17:34.770
What about the reaction of young people.  Do you think that more young black people are interested in law or do you think that as a result of some of the backtracking and even some of the problems surrounding the Baki case which alleges that special programs for blacks and other minorities should be cut back.  Do you think that more black youth interested in law.  Do you think that their initial interest in this area is slackening off some.

Speaker 7 00:18:00.440
Not only is their interest increasing of the.

Speaker 11 00:18:04.190
What evidence do you have for that of applications that we receive.  You mean more black.  Because I had read in one of the reports that the number of black applicants for law school and medical school have decreased because of the impact of the Baki case where many many schools that offered special programs are not now offering them.  I agree that maybe Warren is getting more applications because the programs are being cut out of the other schools.  But looking at the larger picture and you meet with lots of young people I'm sure.  What do you think their reaction is to the legal profession and going into it.

Speaker 9 00:18:38.120
Well that is an indication of their interest now.  Their ability to go to law school is another matter altogether.  But the number of applications that we have received over the past three or four years has remained pretty stable.  Unfortunately we are not able to to fund the the the ablest and the most qualified to go to law school.  Why not.

Speaker 12 00:19:00.260
Because often because of lack of money let's look at the logic that you say you're not able to fund the ablest it would appear to me the ablest would be the ones who would get the scholarships in the existing schools.

Speaker 9 00:19:10.490
That's a misconception as it's been very disappointing that many of the large schools of the affluent schools which you would expect to provide scholarships to the ablest these black students do so in such a small amount that it makes it impossible for many of them to enter law schools.  I see.  But again if so there's no misconception.  You say you're not able to fund the ablest which means that ability is not a criterion academic ability is not a criterion in funding your students.  No we are not able to fund a large number of able students who apply to us.  All right.  Among them are the ablest because some in other words you're suggesting that some of the ablest have economic problems which would not make it possible for them to attend law school without money.

Speaker 12 00:20:03.680
And are you suggesting that you don't have enough money to fund the ablest.  Are you suggesting that even with the money that you give them it's not enough for them to go to law school.

Speaker 9 00:20:12.120
Well both our average award is a thousand dollars.  It's almost impossible for students go to law school without spending at least four thousand dollars.  Some of the law schools provide no scholarships at all.  And many of our applicants seek to enter the law schools in the south which offer very small scholarships if any at all.  Those who go to the northern and the more affluent institutions are given half scholarship and half loans which means that at one institution where the cost of a legal education for one year amounts to better than seven thousand dollars a student gets thirty five hundred dollars an outright scholarship.  Thirty five hundred dollars in loan when that student has completed three years of his legal education is still heavily in debt.  Added to that many of them bring to their graduate studies a debt incurred in undergraduate schools and I know of one instance of a person who is in debt up to something like twenty thousand dollars including the undergraduate and the the legal education loans.  Now what we tried to do to the students who get loans like that awards must be applied against a loan.  And we make sure that the students outright grant is not diminished.  But we make it possible for him to go to law school by decreasing the size of his loan by time he graduates.

Speaker 10 00:21:57.770
Of course those little figures are not literal as large figures that you just described indicate why some black youth are black law graduates will go for the more affluent and better paying jobs because the tremendous financial burden they have assumed as they're getting education and of course that again brings us back full circle to the whole question of the commitment that it really takes us a totally dedicated and feeling person to spend 25 percent 35 percent of his practice on civil rights cases which pack they pay nothing.

Speaker 8 00:22:44.020
And many people are unaware of the fact that we still have a large need for civil rights lawyers all of the civil rights problems have not been solved by a long shot.  And that's probably one reason why most of your fellows and scholars practice in the south.

Speaker 9 00:22:59.650
Yes and they practice in the south mainly because that's where they want to be. And it's interesting that some of our fellows and scholars who are not Southerners by birth or by rearing have chosen to go south to practice law. One of the most interesting and dramatic stories to tell about the Earl Warren program and its impact is what has happened in the state of Mississippi. Ten years ago. It's my understanding there were no more than three black lawyers in the state of Mississippi. And now we can identify at least 50 who have been supported through the Earl Warren program who are practicing law in state of Mississippi including one who was among the first two to get a law scholarship from LDF who has just recently become a county judge in the city of Jackson Mississippi. Another Earl Warren scholar has been an acting judge in Meridian Mississippi. This was unheard of. And unthought of five years ago certainly 10 years ago when there were only three black lawyers in this whole state.

Speaker 11 00:24:10.780
Well what do you really think should be done or can be done to enlarge this pool of black lawyers really really talking about not enlarging it by three or four hundred a year.  We're talking about enlarging it by two or three thousand a year.  What is it.  Is it the fact that law is a profession of the wealthy or is it a profession that people have to learn to want to be in.  Why is it that we have so relatively few black youth going into the legal profession particularly since apparently opportunities are opening up not only in the south as you describe but also in the north and various governmental and business organizations.

Speaker 9 00:24:52.990
I'm not sure I can really answer that question but I think a part of the answer may lay in the fact that many black persons in the south have been so far removed from our legal counsel at all.  They don't know that black lawyers exist in some communities in the south in small communities where they've never had black legal counsel and the experiences that they have had with the law have been so negative that they don't know what the possibilities are.  I'm not so sure that that is the answer.

Speaker 10 00:25:27.720
But I think that it may well be that they many black students have not been around persons who have had legal education and know what lawyers can do because one thing that I've heard of the several hundred thousand lawyers that exist in this country that a goodly number of them don't really practice law that less than half of those who supposedly have been admitted to the bar actually practice many of them use their legal expertise in business and other areas.  And it might well be a socio economic phenomenon in that black generally have not intruded upon the business community as much as the predominant group maybe that might be a problem or maybe as you suggest is just too expensive.  How do you examine that.

Speaker 9 00:26:20.290
Well I think that law itself is one of the most interesting preparations for almost anything a person would like to do.  Many persons who have been trained in the law go into areas other than the law as you indicate.  But I think part of the problem may well be that there is some difficulty in establishing the kind of image in many of these communities that will make the lawyer an attractive model in some communities.  I think another problem is that many of them have had problems with bar associations in the state of Georgia in nineteen seventy four.  I think it was 51 blacks from all over the country from law schools all over the country to the Georgia Bar and they had difficulty passing the bar 51 flunked the Georgia Bar.  So that has been a problem in providing legal counsel in these communities well this type of case that the NAACP Legal Defense Fund attacks.  Yes they attacked the whole question of discrimination and examinations and we have moved in on that.  And we don't have a serious problem now as we once had.

Speaker 11 00:27:46.010
All right.

Speaker 9 00:27:46.250
For young people who are listening in the audience is there any place that they can write or any person they can contact to get information about the legal training program and about the legal profession in general if they would write to the Earl Warren legal training program 10 Columbus Circle excuse me sweet 2 0 3 0 New York New York 1 0 0 19.  I'll be glad to send them whatever information we have.

Speaker 13 00:28:17.180
That should be Butler Henderson.  Earl Warren legal training program 10 Columbus Circle Suite 2 0 3 0 New York New York 10019.  Or else they could call area code 2 1 2 5 8 6 8 3 9 7.

Speaker 11 00:28:32.240
Because I think one of the things that you want to do is to get more and more information about this excellent program about your fundraising.  What do you do to raise funds for this program.

Speaker 9 00:28:41.730
We have fundraisers.  That's their job to raise money for us.  The Earl Warren legal training program has been supported by foundation money largely the Carnegie Corporation was our largest donor the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation.  But by and large we are at the point now that we must depend not only upon corporate support financial support but we are seeking to increase corporate support for the Earl Warren programs and of course with the energetic leadership of Dr. John W. Davis yourself the Honorable William T.

Speaker 11 00:29:18.290
Coleman former Secretary of Defense and the many many other able people on the board of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Earl Warren legal training program.  I know it's going to be a success.

Speaker 9 00:29:30.590
Well we look forward to raising the amount of money that will allow more students to get into law schools and do well tonight.

Speaker 13 00:29:37.680
And so the reason we've been discussing the Earl Warren legal training program with Butler Henderson who is its director This is Roscoe Brown for soul of reason saying so long. Soul of reason is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with the station.
