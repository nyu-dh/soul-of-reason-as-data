Speaker 1 00:00:01.330
Have Black Studies fulfill their potential.

Speaker 2 00:00:04.330
What are the areas of greatest importance in the field of black studies here. Carolyn D'Arcy of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University. Answer these questions on today's soul of reason. This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 3 00:00:41.760
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 4 00:01:02.640
With us today on soul of reason is Carolyn Dorsey instructor in the School of Education in New York University and junior fellow at the Institute of Afro-American affairs. Glad to have you with us today. Carolyn thank you. It's nice being here. Well the few years now have passed since black students and some white students went on strike and demanded that the colleges Institute courses in Black Studies and scarcely any university in the country or avoid it. This particular episode. And now that four or five years have passed and black studies are in. I was wondering how you perceive whether the courses have met the expectations of students.

Speaker 5 00:01:41.490
I'd like to answer that by looking at three different levels of this that are the students that are the instructors and that of the administrators. That's a good I'm thinking about the students. You have two types of students. And they had different kinds of needs. I'm thinking in terms of those students who had the emotional need they needed an emotional outlet. They needed a political form and what have you. I don't think Black Studies has served these people well. These students want a political form. They had to have this outlet but then I think when things began to subside and they began to feel a little bit better they found that their courses had very little content in them and they were not satisfied with them. There are other students who are very very deeply interested in black study in developing it as a. Legitimate discipline. They came as teachers from the schools wanting some help and developing curriculum and finding ways to incorporate Black Studies content into their curriculum. These students I hope are being served and having their needs met. Looking at the instructors once again you have those that were genuinely interested in those that were not. And I see three aspects of this. I see those that were generally interested. They have developed good courses. They're intellectually sound and what have you. There were others who came in who hustled the programs to get a foot into the university which had been closed to blacks and they are playing campus politics for their own state's advancement. And then you have those that are on the same emotional level that I mentioned earlier and they really have no content in their courses. I think Black Studies is going to take a person who is generally interested in developing this discipline and not in attaining his own status it's going take a person who's really dedicated at this point because of the nature resistance to black studies. They're looking at the administrators. And once again you have the campuses that recognize black sites as legitimate. They're interested in developing it on the same level as other disciplines in the university and they have taken in blacks and other minority groups and they've given them the same rank as they've given others in the other disciplines. But then you have those who look down upon black studies they don't consider it legitimate they're considered inferior and they do not give the staff any rank they give them special titles which mean absolutely nothing. And they're not really a part of the campus as such just held out as a separate part or a separate department. And they're not truly integrated into the campus.

Speaker 4 00:04:09.550
I think that's sort of a fantastically accurate portrayal of what the situation is. And given the fact that in America there are some 3000 colleges and junior colleges and most recent survey indicates that oh about 2000 of them have some type of either course or program in black studies. This means that the problem is the problems you've described are really rampant. Yet one other thing that we've noticed is that when the budgetary crisis hits the campuses one of the first things to go is Black Studies unless as you suggest it is soundly based in terms of a sound academic disciplinary approach. And that's one of the things that people like you at the University and New York University would try to deal with. But now as we get into the actual content. We've heard this question once we must have heard it a hundred thousand times.

Speaker 6 00:05:04.920
What is black studies and what are the areas that are covered in courses and programs of black studies.

Speaker 7 00:05:12.750
Okay. I like to look at that by looking at what I have attempted to do and how I have attempted to define black studies myself. I think all areas are of interest and have to be looked into looking at the study of the life of black people in all parts of the world. Many of us are not aware of all the areas that black people have actually gone into. I have tried to broaden the deal's or for my students it's alarming that many people black and white in this country think of the U.S. as America and that's all there is to America. I was reading in the newspapers just the other day someone made a comment that the only person that was not an American attending a conference was a Canadian. Now we know a Canadian is an American. And how an American can grow up with this kind of concept is very very bad. So what we do and what I do in my courses is that I look at the black experience in the Americas and we look at the black experience in the Caribbean and South America and Central America as well as in the United States and Canada because students see this concept of America broaden. So that's very very important. It's more than one America.

Speaker 4 00:06:19.770
That's a concept that really transcends black studies because it says to anybody that the world isn't just one little place that has geographical boundary or political boundaries. It's a place that has links of a physical nature cultural nature transportation nature and so on. I think that's an excellent concept and it relates directly to black studies because black people obviously have been literally everywhere in the world.

Speaker 7 00:06:46.080
He hasn't even brought into all parts of the Americas was in fact slaves were brought into South and Central America even before they were brought to the United States. And as we know many blacks left the United States and went to Canada. So there's quite a black experience up there also to be studied. I think it's important to give any teaching a theme and this is one way I've been able to bring this all together by giving it a theme and this has helped me in planning my curriculum by concentrating in this particular area. Also must take. I find that many people are doing and this is our making and I think is another reason why there's been so much confusion as far as black studies are concerned. They have not made a difference between African studies and black studies. I was one question I was going to ask later. Yes. I think this has been one of the reasons why there has been so much confusion. There is a difference. African Studies is a different discipline from black studies. Also by looking at it in this fashion than I can sort out these two different areas although there is an African background to Afro-American Studies which is very important but it is very very different from African studies per say. I do try to make a difference between the two disciplines.

Speaker 4 00:07:56.020
And let me asked a question or why do you think that so many people who did get into Black Studies put so much heavy emphasis on Africa rather than on the experience of blacks in the Americas.

Speaker 8 00:08:07.890
Well it was probably because of the political realities. What was beginning to happen in Africa. Going toward independence first with Ghana in 1957 on through the 1960s that part because of political things that were beginning to happen. Why this became much more important.

Speaker 2 00:08:24.960
Well don't you think it was probably some emotional base to this to because part of a heightened political awareness or cultural awareness of black people at least for some people tended to focus back to Africa rather than focusing on the black experience the very rich black experience I might add in the Americas. And I think that relates to the earlier point about the two types of interest of why students and some instructors went into it some went into it because of an emotional thing in terms of feeling better about themselves really.

Speaker 4 00:08:56.850
And then ultimately hopefully feeling better about the black community and quite possibly that group might have been had greater affinity in place very important in African studies as against Afro-American Studies. The black experience in America.

Speaker 8 00:09:11.370
You're absolutely right. It was part of the emotional thing that made us look back to Africa but you'll find now in reading different things that people now are saying we should look at the southern experience as the beginning of the black experience in our country in particular and people like Murray who wrote soft a very old place and some of the other things that have come out recently are now saying we should look back at the southern experience for the background of the U.S. black in this country instead of all the way back to Africa and many blacks who are traveling to Africa began to realize there's been a lot of years now and they really cannot identify with Africa. And there really isn't that much identity as we thought. Although it is our background no question about this.

Speaker 6 00:09:57.180
Well what about the relationship between some of the social sciences such as economics and politics and black studies. Because this gets into the other group of people who saw black studies as a way of politicizing the black student and getting the political changes made that they wanted are economics and politics a valid part of black studies as you see it very valid and very important in my Afro-American culture class.

Speaker 8 00:10:30.000
We have a section both on politics and economics and we look at the political history of the black in the United States and the economic history to find out how he has not participated in and how he can now develop strategies to participate in this is very very important and we do place a lot of emphasis on these two areas of the culture of blacks in this country. And we hope that our people will be able go back to their communities those who are working with community groups and they all have some background and some help in helping to develop strategies to increase political participation and economic participation on the part of black people in this country. So those are very important areas. No question about this.

Speaker 6 00:11:11.500
What about the idea that there are some people particularly those who are opposed to black studies come up with that there aren't any resources. There aren't any. There's no data. There are no materials. I happen to know and you happen to know that's not true. But could you discuss that a little bit about the literally what I perceive as the wealth of materials for Black Studies as against the old allegation are that there really are no materials.

Speaker 8 00:11:40.780
Yes that is one of the things that was used by the opposition. There's no truth in it at all as you know. Hi. Fine. I just don't have enough time even to dig out all the things. There are a lot of black scholars and white scholars throughout the years who were working and looking at and studying and writing up the black experience and these things are available just a matter now bringing them back out. Some companies have begun to reproduce some of these books that were printed years ago and were ignored. But there's a vast amount of material. There's no question about this at all.

Speaker 9 00:12:14.290
My students complained about the length of a bibliography that I give them. That's why there is so much material.

Speaker 8 00:12:20.200
There really is a wealth of material and blacks and white scholars alike have been working for years but they've been ignored almost totally.

Speaker 4 00:12:27.820
So just a matter of bringing these things back out Well how do you react to the comment on the part of many black students and some white students that what was written in the past about blacks really doesn't mean anything because it was written either by Uncle Tom Black's or racist whites or liberal whites who didn't know anything about black people. How do you relate to a comment like that or respond to a comment like that.

Speaker 8 00:12:51.010
Well we look at anything that we read for the biases that might be there on the part of the person who wrote them but then we really dig for the real facts and fact as a fact. So even though a person who had certain attitudes toward black people put together a book or wrote a book or some scholarly study you can go through that and just bring out what is really true and ignore those biases because you can find the fact there. And if you understand the writer and where he was coming from and his possible biases then you can deal with that material accordingly having a problem with that.

Speaker 4 00:13:25.150
This relates really in part to the emotionalism that surrounded the origin of black studies that many young blacks in particular felt that the blacks had been ignored in the history books and the English books etc. and they demand that something be done. And then when they found that they hadn't been ignored but maybe sometimes they had been written about with bias or with points of view that differed from theirs. There was a tendency to tendency to reject everything that had been done before. And as I say we have to rediscover the wheel and the fact is that as you suggest quite correctly that there is a fantastic amount of material on a black experience for example right here in New York City we have the Schomburg collection which is one of the world's finest collections on Afro Americana and unfortunately is not adequately supported enough to even catalog the type of things that they are.

Speaker 2 00:14:20.290
In other words a tremendous amount of material in Schaumburg that's in boxes and hasn't been able to be catalog because the library system has not supported it. In addition of which they don't have the physical. So they understand they're about to get a new physical facility. Well we hope so. We hope there are important materials there.

Speaker 8 00:14:37.210
Very important materials. But even in a library like New York University's libraries a wealth of material there. I was very pleasantly surprised when I arrived there. What three years ago to find that they had significant holdings on the black experience. So I think in all the libraries you can really find enough to conduct a good course. If a person is sincere in bringing out this material or guiding their students to find this material the public library the universities libraries around the city or it might take a trip to New Haven to Yale's library or somewhere else in Boston materials are here. Or take a trip into Washington to the library at Howard Dean in the library Congress has a library of congress and you'll just find these historical associations and the various various cities have tremendous holdings but just a matter of finding them knowing where to find them how to guide your students send them for them and to have them develop a good problem if they're searching for an answer for. I think that's the answer to it.

Speaker 2 00:15:38.130
Now it's interesting three or four or five years after the origin of black studies to see that some programs have survived and have grown and others have sort of willed it somewhat. And I know that you're involved in a program at New York University which is a master's degree program to train teachers and professionals in the field of black studies which was the first of its kind in the country and may well still be one of the only ones of its kind. Could you tell us a little bit about the master's degree program in Black Studies at NYU.

Speaker 8 00:16:08.160
Yes I say black studies and education master's program is housed in Division of Social Studies although it's an interdisciplinary program having to be housed there goes to get it through. Dr. Lamar P. Miller is working with it as well as Dr. Charisse who is Division Head of Social Studies and myself. We have approximately a dozen majors. We don't have a large number because of the cost. I think more than anything else that New York University graduate course now with ninety dollars an hour which is expensive. We only have two scholarships but we divide into six partial scholarships of six hours each. We have 18 hours of required work. My two courses Afro-American history Afro-American culture and Dr. Miller of course black studies and education where he helps teachers to develop their curriculum. We do find great interest in it and we have many inquiries about it. But as a matter of funds I think more than anything else at this time. Another problem to the job market in New York City for teachers you know is very very poor right now. Teachers are not being hired especially in social studies. So many people now are beginning not to come into the program or into the school of education because they know there will be no jobs available when they complete their programs. So I think we're beginning to lose some people in education as a result of the situation here in New York City.

Speaker 10 00:17:33.360
On the other hand I do believe that in addition to you majors there are a number of students who take a course here or course there because of the heightened interest in black studies.

Speaker 6 00:17:46.530
And of course this gets into the idea in education today that sometimes a person isn't just in one discipline. He has an interdisciplinary competence.

Speaker 8 00:17:55.280
In other words he may be an English but he also has had some Afro-American history which helps him to be able to deal with his English somewhat better and then many of the teachers in the city too who are teaching black youngsters they come for Afro American history for American culture and they could be in any field actually. So just a matter of getting to know the students that they have in front of them. And that's another reason for trying to broaden our black studies to include the Caribbean. There are many Caribbean peoples in New York City. You have Haitians and you have Jamaicans and barbarians and what have you. That's one reason why I think it's very very important to look at the African diaspora in the Americas instead of just the black experience in the United States.

Speaker 6 00:18:33.500
But one thing I know that you do is to run a seminar a yearlong seminar at monthly intervals in which in various years you take a particular topic in the black experience and deal with it from its various angles. I think you've dealt with the black in the Caribbean. I think you've dealt with the black in New York City and through these seminars which are open to the public and are announced in various public publications such as the village voice and the New York time.

Speaker 10 00:19:03.270
People are able to get some what we might call informal education in relationship to the black experience.

Speaker 8 00:19:09.610
And this has been a very successful program. We did do the first year the black experience in the Americas and we went to the black in New York City. There's been such a demand for the black in the America that we're returning to that topic this year. And our program we'll be starting in October. And we have some very scholarly people lined up. And we hope with another successful year.

Speaker 6 00:19:29.760
So it's very interesting what you're describing because I happen to know a little about the statistics. For example in your school of education courses related to the black experience I think in the past year as many as 400 individuals registered all of the courses collectively not just the ones that you and Professor Miller taught as many as 350 to 400 people registered for those courses. And then if you add to that the approximately 800 or 900 people who registered in some of the undergraduate liberal arts courses. This means that over a given year in one university a large university as many as 12 hundred people registered and not allow for duplication. I'd say as many as 800 or 900 different people maybe a thousand had at least one experience related to some scholarly aspect of black studies. And if this experience could be multiplied throughout the country at least in the 40 or 50 largest universities this might mean as many as 50 or 60 thousand students having some organized experience in Black Studies as contrasted with let's say five or six years ago where maybe it might have been you know two or three thousand in the entire country. So in that sense if you want to put an evaluative criterion on Black Studies at least in my perception I would say that it has been certainly a success.

Speaker 8 00:20:58.910
An interest is growing in it of course because of the politics surrounding it and all the emotion surrounding it at its inception. Many white students of course were not welcome in some of the classes and made them were not willing to come or they wanted to come but didn't feel quite comfortable and did not come. Now I think that's behind us. So more and more people who are truly interested in efforts especially teachers who are teaching black youngsters are beginning to come. So it has had an impact and I think the impact will grow.

Speaker 10 00:21:28.180
What do you think about this the idea let's say the opposition that some of the black students and black professors had against white professors teaching courses.

Speaker 8 00:21:42.160
Well I think it's just like well Jewish history you wouldn't have a person who was non Jewish teach the course. Now the way I look at there certain kinds of courses which can be taught by white or black any scholar who knows the material can teach it. But in the black experience there are certain courses which I think only a black can teach. I think we have to look at very closely there are different kinds of courses.

Speaker 2 00:22:04.420
Give an example of a course that you think would require a black profile right.

Speaker 8 00:22:07.960
Afro American history can be taught by any historian who knows his facts who's done his work and what have you. Let's start thinking about a culture cause you are being a part of that culture gives a little bit more to it. OK that's a good example because many times in class I'm called upon to comment on certain things that I have experienced and it gives a little bit more meaning to it. This is what I mean by certain courses that should be taught by a black person who's lived through this experience.

Speaker 4 00:22:34.000
Well of course it does raise an interesting question when you begin to put a color test on who teaches a course. And I think the approach you suggest is one which relates to the skills that are necessary to teach the course rather than the complexion of individual course whereas undoubtedly black people most black people at least have far more insight into black culture than most white people.

Speaker 6 00:22:58.760
You know there's always that extreme case where an individual may be able to relate across color lines. So when you deal with confidence as you suggest then you have a empirical test and at least it's my belief or feeling that some of these knotty problems that plagued black studies in the beginning have somewhat abated.

Speaker 8 00:23:22.570
Yes I think so. I hope so.

Speaker 6 00:23:25.360
Well that then brings us to the future which is really you know the future is a question mark wherever it is. And in a field like this which is an emerging field where do we go.

Speaker 8 00:23:37.900
Well I hope Prosecco that we're moving toward complete acceptance of black studies programs on the part of the administration that they will be accepted as any other department or any other discipline. They will not be held apart in separate departments or separate institutes. They will become a part of the general university. I hope we're are moving in that direction. I know even in the other departments they have to seek outside funding at NYU I understand almost all departments now have to seek some outside funding because of the financial situation. This presents a problem. I think we were talking just recently about the fact that you have to spend so much time going out seeking funds or you have to sell off some of your people's time to other departments in order to make the money to keep the department going. This takes away from the time it could be used for scholarship for developing curriculum for working with students.

Speaker 10 00:24:33.070
So we have to get to a point where this is not necessary so that the people who are working in this new discipline which is going to take a lot of dedication a lot of time a lot of work can really give their time to this kind of thing instead of to some these other kinds of things because this is just necessity of increased awareness on the part of funding sources and university administrators about what black studies is because we all know that the universities of the 70s particularly the private university but also the public universities are going through a great crisis a financial crisis a crisis in confidence in the administration a crisis in confidence of what education is for what it's about. And one of the things that plagues all of us in the university is on one hand we need to maintain our scholarship and the hard tough work that that entails. On the other hand we had to prepare students who can go out and deal with the real world and sometimes these things seem to be at variance with each other. And that puts us right up against the gun when it comes to raising funds. Do you feel that there is more general public awareness of the need to support black studies.

Speaker 8 00:25:47.450
Well I unfortunately think that it has died out. We say that blacks were in style a few years ago and now they're no longer in style. People have moved on somewhere else in their interest and this is unfortunate but it's up to those of us in the discipline who intend to make it an accepted discipline and who believe in it. And working in it sincerely to keep this thing alive. And to bring legitimacy to black studies that it deserves.

Speaker 6 00:26:15.500
In other words the baby has been born but now we need to give it some nutrition so they can grow.

Speaker 8 00:26:22.160
That's right and dedicated black scholars and others will have to work at this.

Speaker 6 00:26:26.280
Yeah that's what I buy in a sense. People like yourself have to be the catalyst and the universities like New York University and other universities have to at least keep the faith enough to continue to move. What now has been started into a broader spectrum of the academic field because you quite right unless you have the resources you're not going to be able to make the program grow and the resources as books and scholarships and salaries for professors and things that this type well done in the next 12 months. What do you think is going to be of most interest to black scholars is any particular area you think black scholars are really gonna dig into the next year or so.

Speaker 8 00:27:11.510
Well I think the political thing that we were talking about a little bit earlier because we are looking for strategies to improve and to increase black participation in political life in this country as well as the economic life. These are two very important areas. So I think this is going to be the area in which we're going to move. In order to improve the quality of life of black people in their communities in this country.

Speaker 2 00:27:34.390
Well Carolyn I think you've really laid it out for us in terms of where black studies are today and what some of the things that you and others in the field are trying to do and also the importance of continuing the thrust and gaining more support in the universities in government and the foundations for the field of black studies. And I'd like to thank you. Carolyn D'Arcy of instead of Afro-American affairs for being our guest on today's solar reason was a pleasure. Thank you.
