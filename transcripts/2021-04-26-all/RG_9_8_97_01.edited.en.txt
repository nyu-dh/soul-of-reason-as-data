East 110th Street has been the home of many generations of New Yorkers. Jose-Angel-Figueroa will tell us his experiences and his feelings about East Harlem and the barrio as expressed in his new book, "East 110th Street," on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:38.490
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:05.610
With us tonight on "Soul of Reason" is Jose-Angel Figueroa, author of "East 110th Street" and formerly a staff member of ASPIRA, and one of the most promising Puerto Rican writers on today's horizon. Glad to have you with us tonight, Jose.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:01:20.922
Thanks Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:21.091
Now could you begin by telling us exactly what you were trying to say in "East 110th Street"? Sort of describe the book, and maybe you can tell us a few things about it.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:01:30.450
Yeah..."East 110th Street" came about as a...so what you call a multicultural experience, resulting from my experiences in high school, New York University which you know of from being involved in your program, Project Apex. And also came about as a result of my involvement in, community politics, especially Young Lords-type of involvement. And the book is an overall chronicle, you know, cultural and what you call political chronicle, reflecting on the historical roots of Puerto Ricans--you know, second and third generation Puerto Ricans in the United States mainland.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:15.511
And basically the book is poetry, is that right?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:02:17.880
The book is poetry...you know, for this time. Yeah. And I'm going into short story and playwriting...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:24.631
I realize, but I was really referring to this particular book because, as you said, it's sort of a cultural history of your experiences through high school and through community politics--

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:02:36.330
I would say the experiences of most young Puerto Ricans, not mine, because I believe that my people actually wrote the book. I'm the voice for my people--I'm an extension of my people's experiences here.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:50.042
On the other hand, they are Jose Figueroa. Whereas you are an extension of your people, what you experience is your own inner psyche and so on. Now, could you maybe run down a few of the titles of some of the poems which would give our audience an idea of the type of topics that you've discussed and maybe you might want to read one or two of them.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:03:09.780
Yeah, I perhaps would like to read the title--not the title poem, "East 110th St"--but the first poem, which is called "This Book," and this will sort of give people an idea of what the book is about. Although, there'll be some Spanish words you may not understand-later, on perhaps we could get into that.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:28.451
Beautiful. Lovely.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:03:30.990
So: "This Book." I write words--words of murder on an endless night page. Where, somewhere love and laughter still hungers and scratches deep before abulic windows. Feeling like drops of naked sighs ever since Jurakán bwanas walk'd pestilent voices and foot shackled head on with holy minds pasteurized as the divine word by freak gods whose tongue had that Jesus saves walk. And all that time, the weather cock filled its stomach with gold rich from rays of copper'd warriors. Left with memories which suck naboria's dust. Leaving behind the echoes of Urayoán's fotuto sounds that came from the mountains of El Yungue. When he discover'd that a turbulent river could pierce the devil-blood of an armored Jesus faster than the anger of distant spears. And in between these night pages, seek not meanings but tribal feelings. And listen closely to carved out pieces of burned blood erupting from within cemi-stones of oblivion. Still floating on ribs of transparent waters...waiting. Waiting for Taíno Spears to join once more lions of thicker night...that's Africa. Waiting for Taíno Spears to join once more lions of thicker night on a new canvas day. For w the Last Areyto when Yukiyu and black gods will unite and dance together throughout wind bereft. Cojoba spirits, and live to love again old songs that could make longer titles.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:05:41.771
You read very well, as well as you write.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:05:43.870
Thank you Roscoe. I hope you understood it because--[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:05:48.761
Well, when you say I hope you understand poetry, poetry comes from the individual who writes it and obviously everyone who hears it, sees something different or hears something different based on their own experience. And coming out of your experience in East Harlem, your experience as a Puerto Rican, your experience with blacks, your experience with other oppressed peoples, it's obvious from your poem that you are talking about people recognizing their heritage and using their heritage to move ahead and to see where they come. Is this a prevailing thrust in Puerto Rican writing today? I know many of the great Puerto Rican liberators were involved in poetry in the early 20th century.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:06:43.421
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:06:44.021
And many of the radical movements in Puerto Rico really revolved around that...just as Mao in China was a poet, so were some of the patriots in Puerto Rico poets. Is this because of a heritage thing, where it's easier to express and feel through poetry than through narratives? Or is it because of...sort of a creative bent that people who are trying to change things fall into?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:07:16.720
Well let me put it to you this way. Young writers today, Puerto Rican writers--especially those that are raised here--one thing that they're trying to do is reveal, you know, the historical roots of Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and here. But more important: display, show what the lifestyles of the Puerto Rican raised in "Noo Jork," what I call Noo Jork. And the United States meant...what those roots are about, what those lifestyles are about. What we're trying to do is make our voices authentic. You know? I mean a voice that really reflects the Puerto Rican youth today, the Puerto Rican people in the United States.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:05.321
And what are some of those themes?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:08:07.241
Those themes have to do, one, with making ourselves known, in terms of exposing what our identity is. You know that's--that's one of the major themes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:20.471
That's very important. And particularly in regard to identity of the Puerto Rican, [who] at least in New York, has sort of a tripartite identity.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:08:31.151
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:31.991
And that frequently causes cultural conflict. You know, the lighter Puerto Rican identifying more with Caucasian or Hispanic identity, the darker Puerto Rican identifying with his Afro identity, and in between the brown Puerto Rican identify more with Taino identity. [Inaudible] That really is a false dichotomy, which I clearly recognize, and many Puerto Ricans as well as many blacks recognize. It is a basis of cultural confusion sometimes.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:09:01.540
Well yeah, the cultural confusion has a lot to do with us not being able to control media. I mean the images, even of blacks, you know as being studs and so on. The images of blacks and other third world people, you know, I mean has always been something confused, has always been distorted.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:23.530
What about the self image? For example, is it the racism in the society that causes many lighter skinned Puerto Ricans to more identify with their Hispanic origin?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:09:34.270
Well you know, you know as well as I do that, especially with blacks, that the whole thing about image or ethnic consciousness came out of a whole political community type of thing when the word "black power" came into being. You know, I mean, the word did many things to many people in terms of bringing about a whole cultural, you know, artistic explosion of exposure of who they were, and so on. But at the same time it gave the black people and other people a chance to, like, tune in to themselves and say like, "Wait a minute...what...who are we but more important, what are we made of? You know, what are black people made of?" And this is where the whole thing came into, like, going back into a whole history thing. Let me check out my history and see how it developed so far. Let me check about the history of Harlem and let me see what Harlem came into being.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:30.520
But see this is cyclical, because just as I said many of the Puerto Rican radicals of the early 20th century use poetry very sharply...so did many of the blacks, men like Dubois, Weldon Johnson in the 1920s and in the 1910s. So you do have a cyclical thing and part of it, as you relate, is undoubtedly due to the so-called political revolution. And part of it is probably due to the fact that even though there is limited access in the media for blacks and Puerto Ricans, there is more now than there used to be.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:11:04.611
Oh no, of course.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:11:05.961
Many of the type of things that--let's say Jose Figueroa is writing--are coming out. Now, speaking of that--

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:11:13.072
Because there's a need for that, Roscoe. There is a need--even for people who oppose the type of themes that I'm developing and so on--there is a need for that, because it's not...I'm not just writing for Puerto Ricans. You know, I write for people. I write for everyone. I consider myself a universal writer. I...don't believe that Puerto Rican only exists in El Barrio, or that blacks you know are limited to Harlem. I mean, we live everywhere. So like, I don't write just for one ethnic group, I write for people. People who enjoy poetry and people who enjoy other people's histories, others people's lifestyles. So like...I'm for everybody.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:11:56.122
What are some of the things you're writing about now, and how do some of these central themes...for example you've developed very nicely a central theme of the importance of identity and importance of understanding roots. Now some of the other central themes in your work encompass...what type of things?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:12:12.750
Well one of the things I'm concerned about is reflecting or mirroring the experiences of young Puerto Ricans in the high schools. What education has done to our youth in terms of making them disgruntled and befuddled. And they-

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:31.221
Why do you blame education and not society?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:12:33.861
Well education is society, Roscoe. [laughter]

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:36.231
Well in a general sense, but very specifically you're talking about the schools.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:12:39.740
I'm talking about the schools that I went to. I'm talking about the type of experiences that I've seen that still exist.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:45.770
For example?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:12:46.280
I'm talking about schools not being able to respond to bilingual education. I am talking about schools that believe that English is numero uno and that Spanish is across the border. I'm talking about schools--or teachers, to be more specific--that can't relate to the needs the educational needs of young Puerto Ricans in high schools. And for that reason they develop some type of systematic way of undermining their intelligence and their creativity. They have developed a systematic way whereby young Puerto Ricans today have become the highest high school dropout in the United States. And those that have graduated from those educational institutions, Roscoe, those that have graduated have graduated without an education. They're still washing dishes. So that's what I'm writing about.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:13:36.681
And how would you like to see that change?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:13:38.330
In fact I'd like to recite about it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:13:40.180
Okay fine, that's beautiful, lovely.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:13:44.630
This is the title poem from my second book, called "Boricua." Which, 'boricua' means 'Puerto Rican' in the Indian language Arawak. Because our original language is not Spanish, it's Arawak. Boricua, you were born somewhere between American Airlines near San Juan and Kennedy Airport near the Bronx. And I have seen your grinned face listening to bleeding in the distance, as your mind walks backwards backwards backwards backwards backwards. And sees Lincoln Hospital having a field day with your mother because she had labor pains with a Spanish accent, remember négro? Schools always wanted to cave in your Puerto Rican accent and because you wanted to make it, heh, you had to pledge allegiance. Left-handed, because you had lost your soul during some English exam. Report cards fed you with counterfeit dreams, dictionaries carved fear into your skin and had a warrant for your accent because they said--ha!--you were always culturally un-deprived, remember? But who am I talking about, young blood? We're really the same, except that I have seen you drown into multicultural hangouts in Central Park where hyper-tense congas tried to make unemployed crowds freak out on people trying to become apart of one crowd or another. And your spirit. And your spirit looks back for an island and she says "I am not all paradise, négro." Remove your eyes and plant them inside my soul. Yes, flirt with me. But see, infants not yet born crumble. Fire will grow on your loved ones knowing the distance our people have suffered, my child. Help her. Help her, this island says. Help me to silence slum poems by feeding yourself to your people, los boricuas. So that I could eat away all those fatty acids that make it difficult for me to recognize you anymore. In airports. In airplanes. In El Bronx. En las calles de Puerto Rico.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:22.461
Beautiful.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:16:23.780
Thank you.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:24.741
I don't think anybody really needs to know any more than what you said there.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:16:29.720
I'm also concerned, Roscoe, with showing how our people are more and more inclined to relate to self-determination. I believe that Puerto Ricans in New York City would someday be a very powerful force on all levels. You know, in the arts and also in politics, you know. So what. That's not to say they're not powerful now, but I believe--

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:58.380
In relationship to their numbers, they really aren't as powerful as they should be and that's why the type of awareness that you're talking about is even more important.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:17:05.630.0000000001164
But that's one of the major themes, you know, not ethnic awareness but more...it's the same thing as, you know, I would like my people to feel that they are beautiful, because they are beautiful. But it's more important to be effective not beautiful. You know and this is--

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:17:24.232
But effective as Puerto Rican people, not just as people in general.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:17:27.800.9999999998836
Yes, of course.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:17:28.161
In other words, just as the blacks have organized themselves together and move in certain directions as the Jews, as the Italians, as the Irish did in the past. Obviously Puerto Ricans should and will do this. Although some people say, "Why do people of certain ethnic backgrounds have to always look at themselves as of that ethnic background first, and then join the larger scheme second?" What's your answer to that?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:17:58.581
I don't know. I don't think I have an answer to that, Roscoe. But it does get me uptight that somehow we always have to prove who we are. Well like, we find pieces of our identity all over the streets. Some of us discover our identity overnight through a college seminar. I don't know. Others discover identity through a whole political community involvement. Still others discover identity by you know having the Puerto Rican flag all over our bodies, you know? But my point here is that we have...come to a point where we have to go beyond proving the identity of the Puerto Rican. We have to start doing, demonstrating who we are.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:42.620
Now when you say self-determination, it's a very interesting word. Could you sort of develop that a little bit?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:18:48.740
Self-determination is a science. It's not a cultural hangup. It's a science. And that is knowing what your people is worth, or are worth. Knowing what they have contributed in the United States mainland and being determined, positively determined. That is, becoming directional. That they will demonstrate, by doing you know, in terms of meeting the needs of the Puerto Rican community. In terms of upgrading their whole educational stature of the Puerto Rican. I'm saying these are some examples of demonstrating. Demonstrating through the arts, et cetera. Self-determination is a science where our people will be able to see for themselves their worth. And it also means having the power, the right to make your own decisions that affect your own communities here and in Puerto Rico.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:19:47.181
Which means in things like politics, having elected officers from your particular background. And it's not unreasonable to assume that if a neighborhood is 99 percent Puerto Rican, that the representative should be Puerto Rican. Or even if the neighborhood is 60 percent Puerto Rican, at least 60 percent of those representatives should be Puerto Rican and it would not be a rash form of ethnocentrism to think in that way. On the other hand, what about the fact that some people of a given background--black, Puerto Rican, what have you--decide to get on the bandwagon because it's popular? Now how do you deal with the so-called new Puerto Rican? The new, enlightened Puerto Rican, just like we deal with a new enlightened...sometimes called The Black Who Takes Advantage of Situations. How do you deal with that? Do you deal with that in your writing at all, for example?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:20:41.421
Oh yeah. I have several people in my writing, including...well, I don't want to mention names...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:20:47.361
No certainly.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:20:48.501
But I have several people in my mind that, uh...well, I will mention names. Muñoz Marín Rivera, you know, the governors of Puerto Rico and so on, whom I consider traitors to our people. You know, really traitors. Gave in and so on and they convinced our people that their problem was the economy but ended up selling their people when it was really a political problem. And that is not being able to make the decisions, the power to make those decisions. But coming back to what you were saying...you see Roscoe, mass media although it's full of contradictions and sometimes serves to, like, blindfold our people's way of thinking, because it sometimes throws in what they want people to believe. You know it's controlled by people, right? Well sometimes mass media does the people a great service also, because it also reveals the contradictions: it's own. And people in politics, you know especially to be more specific, Puerto Rican politicians who just want to join the bandwagon, but are really ineffective, not doing anything--there are whole rock and roll hit records that they want to produce. You know, well the contradictions will eventually come out through mass media because people will realize exactly what they're doing and what they supposed to be doing. You know, and this is--well, take Nixon. You know, he said a long time ago, "I want you to remember me not by what I said but what I do." Well they'll remember him, okay? [laughs] And this is what I'm saying that mass media would not only reveal itself and it's...y'know...and it's ups and downs, but also the contradictions will come out. So it doesn't matter if you're Puerto Rican, black, or yellow and you're in politics and you so-called represent your people, you're their voice. If you're not effective and you don't reflect on your people's needs, the contradictions will eventually come out.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:22:42.141
In terms of contemporary concerns, what are some of the things that the Puerto Rican community would want their legislators to do, to stand for?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:22:53.211
Well, I think that bilingual education is a very important topic because we have to face the fact: no matter how many economy flights we take back to Puerto Rico, whether it's Christmas or not, Puerto Ricans are here to stay. Y'know? And they have their language, you know, which is dominant Spanish--dominated by the Spanish language. And I feel that bilingual education will help our youth in terms of coming closer to an educational stature that is worth something. That education would then be of value. You know, be treated as a value system for our people, but now because so many of our young bloods you know speak Spanish, speak English, they speak in two languages at the same time, you know? "'Ey blood, what's happening? Hey man, tu sábe? Esta cosa lo que ta pasando." Or "Hey man listen, you have five dollars?" You know, that type of thing, and like many of our young kids are speaking in two languages and I think that's destroying our people.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:23:58.801
So you would suggest...how would you suggest this be dealt with? Because this is a problem at many--

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:24:03.680
I advocate bilingual--I would advocate for bilingual education on an elementary level. You know, through children's poetry, song, art, you know. And...bilingual education is, you know, one issue.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:17.341
Well it's an important issue and I think it's very interesting one, because certainly anyone who has been in New York has seen people of various backgrounds whether it's Italian, Greek, Jewish, speak these two languages. Yet it's been argued that the other ethnic groups in New York managed to make it--whatever make it means, probably it means managed to survive and move up the economic scale I guess I mean--without having an education. Now why would it be suggested...I'm not saying that they made it as well as they should have, maybe they should have had bilingual education. But to raise the question, why would you--how would you answer the suggestion that other bilingual groups made it in New York without bilingual education?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:25:02.300
Well for one thing, the Puerto Rican population has increased more and more. And...I don't like this thing about "this is a Puerto Rican community" and "this is a black community type of thing." But that's the way it is, Roscoe. You know it and I know it. You know, Puerto Ricans have a tendency to move from one Puerto Rican community to one black building or one black building to one Puerto Rican community or vice versa. The blacks--the same thing, we're like nomads. And what I'm saying is that Puerto Ricans have become a hybrid in this country and it's destroying our people. Because--I'm not saying it's bad that we think in two languages, that we speak in two languages, that we'd swing in two languages and that our cultural experience, our lifestyle has been influenced by a whole multicultural experience here. But I am saying that in order for the education of the Puerto Rican in the United States to be worth anything, then it has to be a type of education that reflects his lifestyle and his lifestyle was bilingual. It's not that other groups should, you know, speak German.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:26:07.120
That's a very cogent point. But as we come to close of the program I think it'd be interesting for you to tell us, very briefly, some of the things you plan to do in the future in the arts and maybe some of the things some of the other Puerto Rican artists plan to do.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:26:19.370
Well right now we just organized a group called Puerto Ricans in the Arts, which I will have a TV program--cable TV--starting January 16th on Wednesday. Cable is...Channel D, Channel D...and Puerto Ricans in the Arts is an exposure and exploration of the birth and development of Puerto Ricans involved in the arts, the art-forms created and so on. And people that are interested in knowing more about my work and this program, they could read "El Tiempo" every Saturday, English section. I have a column called "Culture Fried Accents," or a magazine called "Latin New York," the title is called 'Latin Writers.'

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:01.510
I see. That's a beautiful way of extending some of your ideas.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:27:05.951
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:06.371
And in terms of books, I heard you say you have another book on the road. What's the name of that book?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:27:11.920
That book is called "Boricua." I just finished it and hopefully I will get it out this summer. And I have a third book I'm working on now, called "The Birth of Puerto Rican Literature in the United States."

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:21.221
Are you...that's gonna be a narrative sort of?...

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:27:23.900
It's an anthology of different art forms from the eighteen hundreds to now.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:29.051
Who are some of the more outstanding Puerto Rican writers today?

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:27:32.561
I would say Victor Hernández Cruz, Pedro Pietri, I would say Felipo Luciano is involved...there are many young writers and I don't think we have the time to mention all of them.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:44.410
And that's what you find that as a cultural explosion hits a group, hits the community there's so much hidden talent that begins to explode and move around and for us to have an opportunity to hear about.

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:27:57.691
This explosion exists because it's a guidance into ourselves.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:28:01.511
Well that's beautiful, a beautiful summary. I'd like to thank you, Jose Angel-Figueroa, author of "East 110th Street" for being our guest on tonights "Soul of Reason."

Jose-Angel Figueroa 00:28:10.221
