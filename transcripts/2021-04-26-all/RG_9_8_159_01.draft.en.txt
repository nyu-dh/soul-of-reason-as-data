The New York Urban Coalition was organized in 1968 as the corporate community's response to unrest in the black and Puerto Rican communities. Since then its programs have attacked many of the problems facing the residents of the nation's largest city here. Author Bond's president of the New York Urban Coalition discuss its progress and programs on tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason. A program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 2 00:00:48.580
Soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 1 00:01:09.340
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is author Bonds who is president of the New York Urban Coalition and has given great leadership to this organization trying to attack some of New York City's problems in 1976 which is really a tough year for New York City and its residents. Glad to have you with us tonight author is our guest. Glad to be here.

Speaker 3 00:01:28.270
Dr. Brown Well let's begin with the problems that New York City faces and everyone knows about the fiscal crisis and its effect that it's having on the poor in particular the effect it's having on health and hospitals and also the collateral effect on things like fire and sanitation and police. What do you think. New York City's major problems are and how is the coalition mobilizing itself to deal with these problems.

Speaker 4 00:01:55.270
Well let me try to answer the first part of that question Dr. Brown. I think that the the answer to that is a very difficult one. The major problems that face New York City at this time are those problems that are affected and that result from the cutbacks specifically in what we consider to be essential services those essential services however are defined differently by different segments of our population. Let me give you an example in one section of this city for a service that is not universally used like subways or public transportation and buses. If those are cut back the citizen in the middle class area might say well fine that's an inconvenience but I'll take a cab. In other areas of the city a cutback in those transportation facilities means that they cannot get to and from work.

Speaker 5 00:02:53.690
Of course you're really talking about the core and the heart of the city which is something a lot of people have difficulty dealing with the fact that most of our major cities are in their core and their center are predominantly black and Puerto Rican or Chicano.

Speaker 3 00:03:09.580
And poor people from outside say well look you costing us all of this money to provide transportation to provide welfare services to provide free hospital service et cetera we just can't afford it any longer. What's your response to a statement like that.

Speaker 4 00:03:29.470
Well I think that that kind of a point of view is the is the type that is not only negative but it is not realistic. The city the inner cities as we know them now or as let me put it this way the inner cities as we knew them in the past will never be as they were again. And if we want to be more specific and deal with New York City I think that the quality of life here in New York City will never be the same as we knew it. The services and roles of city government that we became used to. And that has become a tradition in this metropolis. We will never see again. And that means then that we're going to have to do something else other than rely upon Big Brother or government. We're going to have to band together as citizens and use people power to generate new sources of energy that will provide the services that we as citizens determine are essential.

Speaker 5 00:04:31.870
Now of course you said something is very important you said that the cities will never be the same and the services and the level of services won't be the same. Some of the people in the black community Puerto Rican community say well this really isn't fair that when residents of the inner city were white European immigrants we somehow managed to do this and the pork barrel was there and the politicians got theirs and the people got some service.

Speaker 6 00:04:59.800
Now that the inner cities are predominately brown and black we don't get these things we're cutting them off. How can you respond to an allegation like that is that really true. If it is true what are some of the things that you think might be done and specific all of them the things the Coalition is trying to do in some of these areas.

Speaker 4 00:05:21.760
Well certainly the statement is true. There is nothing that can be done about it because the times dictate what conditions we face. At the time of the other immigration waves that faced that hit New York. It was a different ballgame. Nowadays the money has dried up and the complexion of our recent immigrants to New York have changed certainly. I think that the answer to a lot of the problems as I've outlined to you prior to this is that people regardless of what diversified groups they come from must join together to solve what is determined by them to be their most immediate needs. Now when you ask what has the Coalition done. I think that a new approach that we've taken and incidentally I've been president of the New York Urban Coalition for the last five months. The new approach that we've taken in our reorganization is away from the programmatic module.

Speaker 7 00:06:20.620
In other words for the past eight years the New York Urban Coalition not only said that they were going to do things to change the institutions that affect the lives of disadvantaged citizens in this city but in fact they led the way by creating modules that others could follow and replicate so that it could be proven for instance that low cost housing could be built so that another approach an innovative approach to education could be proven that it was possible. And I'm talking now about the adoption of the mini school concept which is you know has been adopted into the Board of Education and there are now over 100 many schools in the city of New York. So this approach because again funds for the module approach became less and less available was no longer available to me as the new president of the coalition to use. So I had to look for another method of trying to change institutions that affect the lives of disadvantaged citizens. That method is using what I characterize as the Coalition process bringing diversified groups together serving as a bridge to new linkages that will unleash resources to help solve problems. And also as a catalyst so that we will help others get things done.

Speaker 6 00:07:53.340
All right you said some very interesting things there they're recognizing that the Coalition is a corporate community's response to unrest and conditions in the inner city. In other words is their influence in their interests to make the cities better. Because it's where they make their money. This is where they.

Speaker 4 00:08:10.260
They live in a sense as New York City is probably the corporate home and the world and the hours it Scuse Me is also true because as they stay here then the jobs that they provide stay exactly.

Speaker 5 00:08:22.210
So you said that the earlier thrust of the coalition was almost what you might call the poverty thrust throwing a lot of money from the corporation into programs and many of us may have been critical about the amount and it wasn't enough. But what you're saying is some things were done but now the corporations are retreating partially do the recession partially due to the lack of a positive response to the needs of blacks and other minorities.

Speaker 1 00:08:50.020
And you're saying that as president of this new york urban coalition you have to develop a strategy and part of your strategy as I understand you is a strategy to change institutions because as institutions change in their leadership and their thrust quite possibly what they do might change. So your thrust then is to bring people together to arrive at solutions to common problems.

Speaker 3 00:09:15.850
Could you give me a couple of examples as to what you are doing now to bring some people together on a specific problem.

Speaker 7 00:09:25.120
Yes I can give you a specific example of that. And I draw your attention to the campaign against crime that was initiated some weeks ago by the New York Amsterdam News when this was done. I saw that this was perhaps the largest issue to hit the black community in the last 20 years. And I made known to the publisher of the Amsterdam News that the New York Urban Coalition and its resources would be made available to support such a thrust. As a result a committee has been formed which is commit the Harlem Committee Against Crime which has been headed now by former Deputy Chief Inspector Eldridge wave. And a program is being outlined by which the citizens of Harlem can fight the crime that has been pervasive in the Harlem community all these years. Now you might say this perhaps is a gimmick a public relations gimmick to raise expectations again and nothing is going to be done. Well my answer to you if you had raised that question is this. We have worked out. Graham with the police department we have the support of the police commissioner who has illustrated this support by beefing up the precincts in central Harlem. We have also worked out programs that will be disseminated to the community right down to the grassroots level and I cheered for meetings that involved members of the community.

Speaker 4 00:11:08.390
Organizations 110 representatives of community organizations in Central Harlem a group of 300 ministers another group of black professionals in criminal justice. And just this past Sunday a group of 150 members of the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge and have gotten unanimous support for the concept. Now these individuals are forming committees according to the precincts in which they live or work and that the information from a professional level at the direction of the professional as far as police science is concerned. L. Eldridge wave will receive these programs and disseminate them throughout the neighborhoods in our community.

Speaker 6 00:11:50.860
Well one allegation I've heard about the whole business of black on black crime is that certainly the black resident is the victim of most of this crime. But basically it's a function of the economic system in our society where there literally are not enough jobs for people and black people be on the bottom of the heap the ones who first hit by an employment. Are they also hit by drug addiction. And these two things lead to crime and question that might be raised is what is the coalition doing to deal with core sources of crime namely organized trafficking drugs and unemployment both of which I think the corporate community have some effect on.

Speaker 7 00:12:33.940
Well in answer to your direct question I happen to agree with you that this certainly is putting a Band-Aid on a cancer. But I think that it's an important first step. We cannot address and help and hope to solve the problems of unemployment here in this city. We cannot address and hope to solve the problems of lack of of education that afflict our youth which makes them unqualified for good jobs. But we can point up these issues and we can mobilize to get these institutions to reflect our concern and that's what we're about.

Speaker 6 00:13:10.000
Of course that really is the focus and the function of a mobilizing community. I guess what I was suggesting is that some of the corporate people really need to take more responsibility than they do. I know some of them have taken responsibility and maybe you can't say it as well as I. I really do think the corporate community needs to take more responsibility. But some people have been very active in the fiscal crisis have done an excellent job. People like Felix Rohatyn but there are. And Bill Ellington and there are other people out there who really are turning their backs on New York City and I think that should be pointed up Dr. Brown I agree with you.

Speaker 7 00:13:46.810
I couldn't agree with you more and I it is my I will echo your sentiments certainly private industry has not done what it should do. And I think one of the reasons is that at that it's no longer fashionable because the cities aren't burning. It's unfortunate truth but that happens to be the way it is.

Speaker 1 00:14:04.930
Of course we are fortunate to have a man like Arthur Bonds hitting the urban coalition to keep telling these corporate chiefs exactly what you've told them. Now we're talking with Arthur bonds of the New York Urban Coalition and author I'd like to ask you just how much affect you think you as an individual have on these corporate chiefs. Because we as we've said some of these chiefs really have not taken their responsibilities as seriously as their public relations agencies say they do.

Speaker 4 00:14:31.990
Well that's hard to assess. Dr. Brown and certainly my answer to you would be not as much of an impact as I would like to have while I've been at the helm of the New York Urban Coalition for five months. I think it would be more valid to ask me that question after the first year I say to you that every attempt will be made to have maximum impact on them as it reflects in their corporate policies and hiring as it reflects in their involvement in helping to solve these urban problems. Because mark my words these problems are not going to go away and it's going to be everyone's responsibility and they have the wherewithal they have the money the resources the technical ability and the management to get behind the wheel that will turn toward solutions to these problems.

Speaker 6 00:15:21.880
Well speaking of their having the money and technical expertise I believe I read in the press about the time you took over as president that the contributions of resources the budget as it were of the Coalition had dropped dramatically. Apparently a lot of money had been spent on housing and some people felt that wasn't a good idea and a lot of other money had been spent in other kinds of social programs and the budget had really been cut dramatically. And I know it puts an administrator on a spot to come into a place like that where the budget has really been slashed. What do you think the basis of the budget cut was other than the economy and the lack of fashionable ness of blacks and how do you think or do you plan to increase the budget other coalition.

Speaker 4 00:16:06.250
Well let me answer the second question first. The budget has been increased for 76 the budget that I projected and had accepted and passed by our board of directors is a budget of 2 million dollars for 76. Now that's number one. Actually that's the second part of your question. Number two the reason that the budget was cut prior to my coming in as head of the organization was that the losses that were sustained in the construction of low cost housing were upwards in the millions of dollars. And they saw this direction for funds as a drain.

Speaker 7 00:16:43.690
And so they cut it off. They retrenched and they took care of the response to the obligation of those debts. When an organization reorganized reorganizes that usually is the time for a cutback in the budget figure when no programs are going on. And that was the reason for the cutback in 75.

Speaker 1 00:17:05.560
Of course the urban coalition did hit the black community in Puerto Rican community with great promise and as you've said they've done some things in education and things and housing. But somehow or another the feeling persists that the potential of the organization really hasn't gotten to its maximum that you have all these corporate chiefs. You have all the chiefs of your various black and Puerto Rican social organizations and you said the key to it is people. Now what do you think it's going to take to spark these people the fiscal crisis that sparked a few of them but what else is it going to take as it is I frequent say you can run but you can't hide. You can leave. Try to leave the cities with the problem we've got to chase you out to the suburbs and keep moving. So America has to face the problems of its decaying cities and the problems of those people there. So what do you think it's going to take to bring these people together.

Speaker 4 00:17:57.160
I think that you answered the question the fact that you mentioned that the fiscal crisis that is upon us at this point has brought some of the people together this fiscal crisis could not. And don't misinterpret what I'm trying to say from my personal point of view taking over the helm of this organization. I say that it is similar to the time of the riots when New York was under a crisis at that time a different kind of crisis. So to now with the fiscal crisis it's a crisis that affects not only one segment of our city but all of us as citizens of this city. And so it breathe new life into an organization such as The New York Urban Coalition because here again everyone must turn away from government to some outside agency to provide leadership to seek the solution to our problems.

Speaker 3 00:18:48.730
Let's talk about some of those problems. Every American city has major problems. They are problems and education problems health problems transportation problems with crime New York City probably has the most it's the largest it's the most complex and all kind of reasons have been given for its financial crisis. The overpower the large power of the unions. Duplication of services et cetera welfare cheating etc.. When you really look at this. What do you think the major cause of these problems is a major source of these problems is and how can we begin to make some dent on that particular source or sources.

Speaker 7 00:19:34.020
Well that's a very difficult question.

Speaker 1 00:19:35.940
Well you in a very difficult position and you're very capable of handling some of these. Obviously if we all do the solutions we wouldn't be talking about it right.

Speaker 4 00:19:43.860
Exactly what some of the elements are that led up to our financial crisis that we find ourselves in. Certainly you've enumerated them. The rise of the unions the the contracts that became staggering and strangling to the city from a dollars and cents point of view certainly the kind of management that the city had both on a fiscal basis and the way the city was run from the mayors city hall office. But we were the victims of a tradition here in this city that we thought would never run out. Certainly the pot was all overflowing with gold. We would just add new taxes we would switch over to a new accounting method and everything would be fine because the bond market was healthy and if it held out we wouldn't be having this conversation now. But certainly it has been said and I don't know how accurate this is that as Rockefeller left the governorship in Albany the support from the financial world on New York on New York's ability to buy two place bonds in the market decreased declined and then disappeared. Now that may be a consideration also. So it's a set of events that culminate in this time in which we are living that I don't think we'll ever be duplicated again and certainly has never been duplicated before.

Speaker 6 00:21:11.240
Well of course just the other day the comptroller said that New York City carries so many accounts accounts receivable from real estate that really either doesn't exist or it's been abandoned by the owner. There's no prospect of collecting which of course is an accounting gimmick. But it does point up something about the city we talk about the fact that there's not enough room for people to live. Yet I know myself if I go to East New York Brownsville I go to some parts of the Bronx or even some parts of Harlem I see blocks and blocks that are just flat or if they're not flat they have all housing is now occupied. Now this to me says that there's some potential there's potential for industrial development. We had Frank Thomas of BET's DEI restoration on a few weeks ago and he talked about how they brought an IBM plant right into bed sty and a plan is functioning and is making money. What would appear to me that there are some other possibilities like that and that's something that possibly some of the people in the corporate community may deal with. Is your organization concerned with financial development or is it mainly concerned with service to people at this point.

Speaker 4 00:22:23.010
Well we were concerned with both. I don't know whether you're aware of it or not but we have an economic development arm coalition venture group which was formed many years ago at the outset of the coalition. It has as one of its corporate entities a mosaic that's a minority enterprise business investment corporation and we have been responsible for giving loans to black businesses over the past years. On a very high level and I draw your attention to Essence magazine which could not have been started without financing from the Coalition venture group you world advertising optimum computer. And of course the largest black construction firm in the country F.W. Evers Lee. So we are and have been involved economically with creating businesses that will generate jobs.

Speaker 6 00:23:15.660
Because what I was referring to. I think that's excellent. What I was referring to is some of these major businesses actually resettling some of their plants and some of their offices in the minority community. And whereas IBM did this in Brooklyn Betts die I imagine that there must be some other firms that could do this. And I think it's really goes back to the commitment of both those corporate executives.

Speaker 4 00:23:38.910
It goes back to that. And let me just mentioned this. We have never been involved in that kind of a thrust. That's a different thrust from our mission. But I draw your attention to the South Bronx overall economic development corporation headed by John Patterson who is now at work with getting a Coca-Cola bottling company to relocate into the South Bronx and to revitalize that area.

Speaker 6 00:24:02.980
All right. The kind of thing we should really be doing as black people collectively. But let's talk about another issue that relates to the city and that has to do with the racism in the city. Some weeks ago on public broadcasting Bill Moyers did an excellent program on the Rosedale situation where there was tremendous friction and still is between black and white residents. What is your view about the level of racism in New York City at the present time. And what if anything is the coalition attempting to do about it.

Speaker 4 00:24:30.040
I think that the level of racism in New York City is at that indeterminate stage where we all can point to it and say it's still with us. It hasn't gotten much better however there are fewer and fewer incidents that we personally know about. And that's a very very tricky stage. I think that the the level of racism in the city has reached that level unfortunately where we are satisfied to live with it. We can't overcome it entirely. It doesn't bother us on a day to day basis as it used to. But it's there. It's like knowing you're walking around with cancer that hasn't killed you or given you the symptoms that will lead to your death on an immediate basis.

Speaker 6 00:25:17.450
Well I would be a little stronger but I think that in terms of the opposition of the employment community to affirmative action that there's definitely racism on a day to day basis which is easily seen of course with unemployment. And I was a little difficult to see it but it is definitely there that the media for example the media has a terrible record in New York City the media capital has a terrible record. Now I'm not saying that the urban coalition can do everything but I was wondering if your organization has done anything with the Human Rights Commission or with some of the groups like Black Citizens for Fair media to really begin to work on discrimination in certain industries. Is there something that you have looked at and have brought up maybe with them.

Speaker 4 00:26:01.450
No we haven't. And I'll tell you the reason why Dr. Brown. Well I agree with you as you point out the racism in various areas of job discrimination which of course has been with us and is with us at this present time because there are government agencies and other organizations whose mandate and mission is to attack this problem we don't believe in duplicating or competing with them in this area. We fight it and we cooperate with them wherever and when if ever we can. However our thrust has been of another approach to solving racism and that is bringing people together. We have been instrumental in forming the new york urban the New York federation of urban organizations which has as its constituency membership members of the Chinatown Planning Council the Puerto Rican Forum the NAACP 100 Black Men the Nation of Islam and other organizations that are reputable including Bedford Stuyvesant restoration the South Bronx overall economic development corporation and OIC. Now this is an attempt to get diversified segments of this city together as represented by blacks Hispanics Asians and poor people generally. And once this federation is functioning at top speed then we provide a vehicle and a voice for this segment of the population that have not spoken and much less spoken together.

Speaker 1 00:27:30.600
All right if anyone in the audience wants to get in touch with the Urban Coalition to get involved in this how might they get in touch with you.

Speaker 4 00:27:37.810
All they have to do is to call the Urban Coalition at 3 9 9 0 200 that's 3 9 9 0 200.

Speaker 6 00:27:46.300
That's the New York Urban Coalition for people who want information about the programs of the coalition or information about this new activity to bring people together. That's correct. All right as we close the program what is your main thrust for the future.

Speaker 4 00:28:02.590
Our main thrust for the future is trying to improve the quality of life for the disadvantaged citizens of New York City and whatever methods that we possibly can. Our thrust is going to be in a community outreach program in education and in housing housing specifically where we advocate rehabilitation of existing housing stock and tenant ownership.

Speaker 6 00:28:23.660
All right I think that's an excellent program for the future and I think we have a great person to handle it. Our guest tonight has been offer bonds as president of the New York Urban Coalition and we've been talking about the Coalition's approach to the problems of New York City. Thanks again for being our guest author. Thank you Dr. Brown.
