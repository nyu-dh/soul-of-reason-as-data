Every Friday Saturday and Sunday audiences at Harlem's New Repertory Theatre are rolling in the aisles and laughter at the new play about black life in 1930s in New Orleans. Here Roger Furman director of the new heritage Repertory Theatre discuss his new play and developments in black theater on tonight Soul of Reason. This is "Soul of Reason,"a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:47.140
Soul of Reason is produced by WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:07.990
With us tonight on Soul of Reason is Roger Furman who is director of the new Harlem the New Heritage Repertory Theatre in Harlem. Roger. Glad to have you with us tonight. Glad to be here. Dr. Brown Roger has written a number of fantastic plays and has done an excellent job in Harlem on One Hundred and Twenty fifth Street at the new heritage Repertory Theatre. And right now as we said at the beginning of the show audiences are really splitting their sides laughing at this play about bordellos in New Orleans and 1930s the name of the play is Fat Tuesday and let's begin by just asking you why the play is called Fat Tuesday.

Speaker 4 00:01:45.190
Well Fat Tuesday that's the day of my autograph proceeding Ash Wednesday Ash Wednesday they all stop and start praying and you know you repent for all the things you've done on Fat Tuesday they want to be sure they do enough to make sure you must let your hair down do your thing.

Speaker 3 00:02:00.310
Now this is about a black bordello in New Orleans in the 1930s. Tell us a little about the play because I know that it is very very funny.

Speaker 4 00:02:10.060
Well a lot of people talking about it takes place in New Orleans. We've seen the dirty 1930s. I've always been fascinated by New Orleans. My father's from there and I've only went there once just to visit but all my life I've heard about New Orleans is Storyville.

Speaker 5 00:02:24.640
And of course the black music like Satchmo and the Jazz and Congo's Queen and Marie Le VO The famous voodoo queen in New Orleans is quite an exciting place. So I decided to just get all the books and talk to all the people I knew that came from New Orleans.

Speaker 6 00:02:39.160
So it's like second hand version of it. And I was very happy because several people say baby that's just the way it was you really got it. You know as it's a good fun show. It's not it's not a social play. You can find social I guess implications in any drama if you want to look at. But is this a good time. Funny zany kind of play.

Speaker 7 00:03:03.350
And of course you like to do things like this. I do some of your other plays who have an endless amount of humor.

Speaker 4 00:03:08.920
Yes. Well I like lines and you say we just laugh and keeping quiet.

Speaker 7 00:03:13.450
Well and of course a political statement though. Well you say that you laughing and crying it's a political statement.

Speaker 3 00:03:20.350
Particularly in New Orleans where there has always been a cross mixture of cultures the French and the Spanish and black and the Anglo. Yes. And each of these cultures and sense have developed their own forms in New Orleans and Mardi Gras is a time when it really all comes out comes together. And even now there's been very very vicious prejudice in New Orleans. New Orleans was very prejudiced place in the past and maybe even now there's still been a kind of a truce a social truce that comes about at the time of Mardi Gras.

Speaker 6 00:03:54.220
Now why is that. Well I really don't know. Because in this house that I write about they have the Creole girls they're the Creoles and a couple of Cajun ladies. And in my research for the houses were integrated one point especially in Storyville. In fact there was a man in the play we call a whip and sang. But from we gathered he was called something else and these books we read about him and he mentions about all the various white ladies black ladies and Creoles he says in betweens it all live work in these houses.

Speaker 8 00:04:27.920
So we'll Why is that. Because it's really adapted from all of this. You know that's why it's so funny. So even even the lowest point of degradation they were integrated in many ways.

Speaker 7 00:04:40.480
Of course you're saying band behind the doors you know that house of prostitution is lowest point of degradation the fact that they exist and I sort of support it clandestinely by some of the best people. Oh yeah. I was going to ask who patronize.

Speaker 8 00:04:54.130
Well a bordello. Some of the best people doing the 1930s when times were hard. The house was subsidized by the chief of police and governors and people like that.

Speaker 9 00:05:06.440
They thought that they would they would they lend the girls lend the House matter money to keep them busy keep to keep the business going to keep the champagne and keep the place up keep the house.

Speaker 8 00:05:15.820
And they would lend them money in the houses weren't raided. And so it's just like it is today it wasn't much different between 1930 and 1975. Of course that raises an interesting social question which I don't want to get into.

Speaker 10 00:05:29.860
I knew that was gonna come out and that is that in a society where allegedly things like prostitution are illegal yet the we carry through so many of the social symbols of it. Many of our clubs and social institutions are built around women and liquor as it were. Yes.

00:05:49.770
And maybe that has something to say about the way in which society that is rudderless attempts to find its balance.

Speaker 4 00:06:00.160
It could be possible. And I just I don't think it's just here in America but what I gather France England all over the world you have hours of prostitution and a lot of plays have been written about.

Speaker 11 00:06:11.010
I think George Bernard Shaw. He let the world know what it was.

Speaker 4 00:06:13.670
How is his play the way it was houses in several great playwrights are written about prostitutes and the lay of life.

Speaker 7 00:06:21.750
Well let's talk about black theater in general because black theater is flourishing.

Speaker 12 00:06:25.740
It's been flourishing now for about six to seven years and in many ways it's reaching its peak is a reaching toward its peak as an art form. What do you see about or do you think about the 1975 1976 theater year. Particularly with emphasis on black theater.

Speaker 13 00:06:45.690
Well black theater still alive and well and kicking along well you know black it has always been here.

Speaker 5 00:06:51.870
Dr. Brown people sort of say like it just came out the 1930s. But from what I can gather the research in the region I've done back in the 1920s the so-called Black Renaissance when you had the coming of plays by D.W. Dabba doughboy created and Langston Hughes suitcase Theatre in Rose McLennan she was compared with Ethel Barrymore and then they did the Paul Green plays was a white writer you know from from Chapel Hill North Carolina you know the Carolina play makers was a white group that did things in blackface that came out the 20s then. And bad for you had the minstrels and you had a lot of the churches. So you've always had black theater.

Speaker 8 00:07:29.850
So it's not like it just popped up in the 1960s it's always been there because in the back in the 1940s you had the famous American Negro Theater who took and cast that of Broadway which must've ran about five or six or seven years.

Speaker 3 00:07:42.630
Well of course I think what we're saying in terms of black theater bursting forth we're talking about bursting forth in terms of recognition. I see on the Broadway's The Nation and in the press and even some of the themes that they're dealing with a revival of many of the themes that have been dealt with with the recent Black plays or revolutionary plays.

Speaker 10 00:08:01.920
And one thing is happening this year and the year 75 76 we're going into 76 now is the fact in musicals 10 attending now to overweight. What you might call drama is bubbling brown sugar. We haven't been Bessie we have treatment issue. We have a raisin which is moving out out of town now but we have a lot of a lot of musicals yet dramas are really we. We've had our river Niger's and we've had our wine cellars what the wine cellar is by. But the balance at least as I view it is probably swinging more toward musicals now is that because of a political thing or is that because of just the natural developments that occur in theater.

Speaker 5 00:08:49.380
Well I think it's a natural development because there again back in the 30s and 40s in 20s you've had musicals you shuffle along and you had thing you probably did years ago about the district about the disc jockey about the jockey little Augie St. Louis Woman.

Speaker 8 00:09:07.110
I can't name the mobile we've always had musicals. They've always been here. But I think maybe the media now has made has publicized them to the point where we maybe more people know they exist. There's nothing we love like a blackbird years ago was written by James V Hatch. And so musicals have always been around.

Speaker 3 00:09:25.230
So what you're really saying is that just the perceived greater emphasis on black musicals really as more Mariah's and a fact and probably the same criticism of the same comment could be made about what is called white theater in that most of the time the best sellers on Broadway are some form of musical.

Speaker 11 00:09:45.510
Yes. Period. You're right. Because of course you know Oklahoma and South Coast the South might have become great in America has produced some really great musicals and I've been in other parts of the world. It seemed that the Americans can put together put together a musical so much faster and so much quicker. It was so much more elaborate. Maybe it's more like. Well black folks in other words American music is basically black music.

Speaker 8 00:10:08.430
I think it's a combination of the two forces you know working together you know maybe not working together hand in hand but by osmosis you know cos the blacks the music is quite obvious and the dancing isn't Gershwin's music and I think Agnes de Mille and these people they admit you know the American folk dancing and the black people they watch them and so forth and in our popular dance like the Lindy and the various things of course this has to come into the theater. You know Michael Kidd has done things like when he did the West Side Story and of course Catherine Dunham played a great hand and you met on American musical stage of course you just get that kind of credit for it. And of course Mr. Bill Ford who just passed recently and people like Peter Gennaro and a lot of these people who are now top choreographers in America had made public statements that the blacks were very responsible instrumental in an inspirational line with their artform. Well if we can take the modern jazz at least you know what about the ballet and that type of thing. Even there there's some intrusion there. And then I think it's economics because I'm putting on a musical now the first time I put together a musical. And you do have to deal with with the orchestra. I got a four piece orchestra you know four or five piece and you've got to pay these people in the pay scale.

Speaker 11 00:11:21.460
I'm not playing a muni scale in my theater. Fortunately and I'm so glad you're off Broadway off off off Broadway off. I can understand and you need trained singers and you have to have a booking you need a choreographer. So it's a little more. I think it takes much more work to put together a musical than it would a straight drama.

Speaker 3 00:11:38.350
Well I see that might have led to interesting although you know we get into the question of what's the purpose of theater because obviously it is to entertain but much of the world's theater is certainly going back to Greek theater or a Russian theater English theater has dealt with the mores and manners of man and well so does black theater.

Speaker 11 00:11:59.170
What else can you do. Well what I'm dealing with drama.

Speaker 14 00:12:01.910
So I think that you probably as you rightfully identified and both in white and black theater it seems to be more emphasis on musicals. Maybe it's because they have to make money. I don't know.

Speaker 7 00:12:13.570
But where do we go. I guess the question I'm asking is Where are we going in terms of our serious black drama.

Speaker 8 00:12:19.330
I think if you did a West Side Story which they say is a takeoff on Romeo and Juliet and if you did the same thing very serious I mean like as a drama with the Puerto Rican Italian whether it was going at the time I think it wouldn't have been that successful because there's a social play people want to deal with these things. But once you put music to it it makes it romantic. You can do a lynch theme as long as you put music to it and people buy it. No but of course you guys all the blow now a lot of lots at the core of my question.

Speaker 3 00:12:46.850
Now if theater one role of theater beyond entertainment is to help us to understand our mores manners principles etc. Maybe it shouldn't be sugarcoated.

00:12:57.460
Maybe it should be laid out there just the way it is. And of course because black life is just so harsh the reality is so harsh. It's quite possible that black playwrights have difficulty writing it black audiences have difficulty seeing it. And for white audiences it's almost impossible.

Speaker 8 00:13:17.350
But I think it's very I think it's very painful that people have to go into safety. I my fear has been Harlem has been there for quite some time in the heart of the black community. So like when I did the long black block what you saw so you came out the long black bloc into the theater into another long black bloc. You know after a while you know what reality set in where the drama took place.

Speaker 4 00:13:39.130
And of course you know so therefore I feel that I feel that if you add music to these things sometimes it makes it more palatable even.

Speaker 12 00:13:51.550
And of course if he had humor it makes the humor even more powerful and because that's what the new play by Roger Furman Fat Tuesday is about those in the audience interested in finding out about this play should call 8 7 6 3 2 7 2. That's a new heritage Repertory Theatre at 43 East 120 Fifth Street at Madison Avenue. Now the new heard Repertory Theatre Raja has been in existence for how long.

Speaker 4 00:14:17.650
What's about.

Speaker 8 00:14:18.850
Since 1964 1964 or we were founded up at the Women's y y w y w CAA which used to be at one hundred thirty one hundred and twenty fifth miss.

Speaker 9 00:14:32.190
It used to be right. Miss Arrington right.

Speaker 7 00:14:33.850
We started out in there and we worked our way through several public schools until finally we end up in our loft where we are now and it is community theater it is in the community there is an in a sense it's a new development particularly for four black communities.

Speaker 10 00:14:49.870
Could you tell us a little something about how you feel your theatre the new heritage repertory company relates to the Harlem community it's obvious that it relates because it's on a hundred twenty fifth Street near Madison Avenue and it's obvious that it relates because you write your firm and you know Harlem.

Speaker 4 00:15:07.120
But tell us a little bit more about how it actually related to its program type of plays tries to put on the involvement of people from the Harlem community will of course most of the people that come to see the plays are from the black community in Harlem and throughout the city. And Monday nights we still have open houses on Monday nights. We would have liked discussions where people would come in and get a free cup of coffee and leave a donation to pay for the coffee and they can talk about anything they'd want to talk about like a forum and we'd have people like Ed Burns come up and read a new play. Richard Wesley and various entertainers would come. Then we'd have people on the street we'd talk about consumers fears anything that was that was that was important to the community. Various groups would come and just we just sit and have open meetings.

Speaker 7 00:15:54.940
In other words it became a place where the community could communicate come and sit and talk which goes back to one of those principles of theater.

Speaker 8 00:16:01.740
And I'd put everybody up by twelve o'clock. I'd just say Hey let's go home now I'm tired you know. But it was very interesting this way. A lot of them had somebody would come just for the forms. Then they'd found out later on well they're putting on plays here let me go see some of the plays you know that is and this way we bit by bit we begin to develop audience and they say well I've got some friends I'm going to bring them back.

Speaker 13 00:16:22.260
I belong to X amount of organizations I belong to this church I belong to that social club I belong to call it playing but I work in such a such a bar like opening night. We really have street people that come in there like my bar maid where I go and she sold a 25 tickets for the show. And a lot of people after play is often still sit there as if the play is going to be be repeated again like in a movie because they really don't know each other.

Speaker 8 00:16:47.460
They said what time you want to click on start again. And I use no time flick was like a movie. I said we'll start again tomorrow and people call it for reservations. Now they say you got any more openings. I think they want to join the theater group. They mean reservations. So it's quite interesting to watch the people themselves being developed as well as myself in the theater and our actors.

Speaker 10 00:17:06.660.0000000001164
Well you didn't talk about this concept that you wrote and produced this play the long black bloc which deals with a block in Harlem and then you said that the folk come from the long black bloc participate in the theater and then go back to the long black bloc.

00:17:22.770
Does that have something to say about the role of theater in a black community.

Speaker 4 00:17:30.420
Well I think the same role that any theater plays throughout the world.

Speaker 8 00:17:37.950
It's the same thing the black community. We put such an emphasis on the black community as if it's so totally totally special especially that's one more in one way. But it's not because I've been reading I see that Abbie plays in Ireland do the same thing they're going through a revolution the Jewish theater Bima and the comedy France scene in France.

Speaker 5 00:17:56.490
And it seems to be the same thing over and over and now in Brazil you know with their new theater and a lot of the left wing countries in the new so-called independent countries it seems that theater does play a great part in all in our lives as human beings interpreting the mores and also establishing certain political lines.

Speaker 7 00:18:15.270
Yes. You say there isn't necessarily political.

00:18:19.150
And I would say that that everything that you project about your society in fact is political. Because if it's a challenging theatre such as the New Left theater or something like that it deals with a particular area that is a area of sensitivity. So black theater in the black community where you go right out on the streets at least as I see it helps us black people to get some insight into some of the forces that are affecting us and not all of those forces are white forces.

Speaker 8 00:18:53.120
Many I agree with you. I mean there's no argument there. I think that's quite obvious.

Speaker 13 00:18:57.210
Now it depends on how the playwrights handle that particular material how they decide to say it because you may find some black playwrights extremely bitter so therefore their work will be distorted to a degree. Some people more can cope with it more than others and so therefore their work may be a little bit more level headed. So it all depends on who is writing the play at you know at the time you see these things.

Speaker 10 00:19:21.960
What about the people in your company the actors the stage managers the costume designers where do they come from.

Speaker 13 00:19:29.160
Well they come from various parts of the city like Dee Robinson who worked with me on Fat Tuesday who did the music and the lyrics and had the original idea of this to do a play about New Orleans. Now she comes from the community she's always been interested in theater for a long time.

Speaker 8 00:19:45.210
She's a mature woman and just so this has become like a good sounding ground for her you know to do her things and she writes beautiful music and like she's a woman of a certain age. Like I tell it like she's should have been discovered 20 years ago she knows she got to play catch up. So there's a lot of people like that around the community you know. So therefore there's plenty of people for me to people that come there to want to learn how to act and write plays and design cars other words that if someone in our audience really felt that they weren't to learn how to act and wanted to get involved.

Speaker 3 00:20:17.490
All I need to do is call 8 7 6 3 2 7 2 and ask Roger fair measure and they'll be invited to join the comp certainly well it's a People's Theater that sounds but it is a People's Theater.

Speaker 14 00:20:29.610
Like I say most theaters are people as well as a whole group of theaters community theaters we've dealt with the black theater alliance.

Speaker 10 00:20:37.740
Sure. Joan Sandler and Bailey and some of the folks over there are and they've been on our program and talking about community theater. What's your opinion about the support for community theater. Because so much of the recent community theater came out of the poverty programs and out of the various grants that are given to you know cool the black community. Now that the black community is being cooled by recession and sort of ignored what's happening to community theater in black then you see the theater becomes even more important now.

Speaker 4 00:21:10.870
I saw a very disturbing cartoon by was a five day Jules Feiffer 5 which is fantastic he showed the man talking to a black man this is what would happen. What's your program nice as well. You know we lost a revolution. We lost respectability News went in a slowly decreased down as well. What's your program now. He says more styles more music more movies and that's what's happening. It seems very painful but that seems to be.

Speaker 7 00:21:37.150
However black theater Black Pete is not in that he is not in that category because even in a musical show it should be some self being asked to look at what our life is about and that's as much our heritage ideals with our heritage as it does deal with the present rather than the cultural aspect becomes sort of like a leadership in its own way.

Speaker 4 00:22:00.370
You know it's a drag you have to be put in that situation but you find people now coming into the theater to see it begins to take the place place of the Malcolm X's and the Dr. Kings and so forth and so on that mean that the Roger family to write these plays have a responsibility to do something what we've shown you have responsibility I say something to say something I think we all are aware of that I don't think that's any news any black playwrights of the black theater ought to be known as a we're well aware of that.

Speaker 10 00:22:27.640
Now in your case Roger Furman What are you trying to say. We've talked about your insight. You talked about your humor talk what your understanding of black culture and we talked about it before the show. You don't sit down and play it. I'm going to get this matches across. But the message it comes across in plays or any writes plays. That is the message in terms of what that person thinks about his life and life of his people. So what are you saying.

Speaker 13 00:22:52.720
Well I'm going to sound corny. I'm just writing about life or that takes me like this play takes place in a like a bordello in the 1930s the last play was a long black block. We just did a play called Strivers Row which is about the bourgeois blacks of the 1940s. And we have another play coming up which takes place in a black gay bar. And we have another play which is a deal with some church people. So it just deals with all of the human aspects of life.

Speaker 14 00:23:23.110
I can't say we start putting these together putting these together as you say it deals with life. It deals with black life deals with various things that black people have experience. Let us say that groups of people in the Harlem community over five or six year period visit your theater. They visit Barbara and T is theater they visit some of the Clinton Erin McClintock theater. What kind of message do they get. What does this do for them. Well each theater gives a vision a different aspect of the human condition.

Speaker 13 00:24:00.950
Renee McClintock is now going to do a thing on a ritual on shingle. You know the African gods Baba in tears. She does a ritual theater and of course I do another type of theater or I find that people come I don't ask them when they leave or what did you get. I just see them come back time and time again. So that's to me even though it was that eating the tasting that Putin is the proof they keep coming back. That's all I'm concerned with. I don't sit and ask Well did you what did you know.

Speaker 9 00:24:30.490
I realized that I had a question there and then I realized I have 110 seats in my feet and I got a hundred ten people in there. Boy you have that much weight. I don't really want I'm so I don't know what happens to their mind. I really don't know. I mean they come to see Fat Tuesday live and they have a good time to tell me they're coming back again. How long is this play going to run is funny right. We really enjoyed ourselves. That's all I'm concerned with I don't I don't get I don't ask them these little let me ask the question another way. What do you get out of doing it all. I'm an artist. I'm a creative person. I get the satisfaction I created something that's what I can get out. I still don't get no money out of it. Yeah that's generally true for people so they get into the arts. Now are you a creative person you're a creative person dealing in maintaining my black experience it maintains my sanity here in this madhouse.

Speaker 8 00:25:20.710
In what way does it do that. Well I'm. You go to a psychiatrist you talk about your problems aren't you. You're right. So I'm able to put it on paper you know. But I was I dealt with the harsh realities of this country. Just the world like like I said don't bother me I can't cope I think we'd all be in trouble. So art is a force that keeps us alive.

Speaker 7 00:25:40.750
And of course all of us. You know what you really say. No you're really asking you a question. Yeah. In terms of what's happening to those 110 people.

00:25:49.060
Yes I'm in there on Friday Saturday and Sunday. And also you're talking about the the necessity of having a vibrant black theater and further as I see it reason why black theater is such a strong force in American theater a world theater is because the realities of black life are so harsh that we have to deal with it.

Speaker 4 00:26:09.890
Yeah well I was done. They I met a woman I was having meet my one of my quick drinks and she thought I was Richard Pryor little white lady. She gave it to me. You know she's talking.

Speaker 8 00:26:20.090
And here is a cell phone that's all. So you rich. I've heard on the record I said I'm not rich and then she said well you know I've seen all the plays all when she was about 65 70 years old you have seen all the plays on Broadway since I saw Ray's and she's went on and on is a you know New York is such a rough city that only thing that keeps me alive in New York is going to the theater.

Speaker 7 00:26:40.680
That's it that keeps me going in other ways and helps her to be able to deal with the reality I. It might have helped because she was white and she was saying it's all black people it comes out even doubly so the question I sometimes ask myself is what happens to white people who go to see these plays. I asked him what happens to black people. I hear a number of things their so-called liberal whites who say they really understand are people who say well I really don't understand how people could live like this. What do you think happened.

Speaker 6 00:27:15.120
Do you have many white people now who attend you know they come up short they come up. I do a Sunday matinee so I don't come on Sunday afternoon you know. And they enjoyed the shows. We don't there again. I don't.

Speaker 4 00:27:29.450
Of course not I'm sure a conversation with I mean they come as patrons of the theater and spectators and they pay their admission they go when they see a play and they leave you know. So I don't really have time to talk to them in that sense I welcome them in. You know I mean some people they may say well this play was very funny. How can I bring some more friends up or would you move around with it. Are you going to move around. Well yes we are we're planning on doing a tour with fat Tuesday and we want to get down to Washington down to Philadelphia. So we already got those wheels turning in motion. All right.
