Sam Clark's "Black Americans" 00:00:17.180
The Black man is still fighting the United States government.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:00:21.220
So says Sam Clark in his new record, "Black Americans", a record about Blacks and the bicentennial. Here's Sam Clark discuss his new racket on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:52.531
This is "Soul of Reason" a program that will examine the roots of the Black box. And soul of reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:19.510
Our guest on tonight's sole reason is Sam Clark, who has just made what is probably the first record about Blacks in the bicentennial. A D.C. record called "Black Americans." Glad to have you with us tonight Sam.

Sam Clark 00:01:32.230
Thanks. I'm happy to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:34.120
Okay we're going to hear the record in its entirety later on. But I think it's interesting that you have chosen to do a record about Blacks and the bicentennial and the bicentennial celebration because as you know, being a freelance reporter and one who covers Black thing pretty well – a number of Blacks are concerned about Black recognition of the Bicentennial around Bennett for example in Ebony Magazine says, "no we should not celebrate that we should ignore it." Some other people say, no we should not necessarily celebrate it but use it as a time for analysis. One sure thing is that joy isn't going to go away. In nineteen seventy six. You know as they say on NBC and others the happy birthday America. So what do you think about it. Because it is certainly a serious issue. It's not a frivolous issue. The fact that America proclaims to be the center of freedom and the fact that Black people have been oppressed for one hundred and fifty years before the founding of the country and 200 years afterwards does give rise to some really serious questions about Black participation in the bicentennial. So what is your opinion about that?

Sam Clark 00:02:50.770
Well first of all I'm surprised to hear that liberal Bennett would say don't celebrate it at all. I mean I'm really surprised that coming from such a distinguished Black writer –now and I'm sure that doesn't represent the views of Johnson Publications, I think we should say that also.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:07.870
And of course they did run a full page front cover story-

Sam Clark 00:03:11.322
-The August issue-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:12.290
covering three points of view. You know we should celebrate it. We shouldn't celebrate it or else we should use it as a time for analysis.

Sam Clark 00:03:21.161
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:21.550
And I guess

Sam Clark 00:03:23.091
they did come out with a bicentennial issue.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:24.701
They did

Sam Clark 00:03:25.001
in August.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:25.570
That's true. But Lerone was making a clear point and I think it is a valid political point although maybe not a particularly practical point, but yes we really ought to question whether we Black Americans should join in this bicentennial celebration. So what did you do – what are you trying to do in the record. I think that's one of the important points.

Sam Clark 00:03:43.930
OK. Coming from a background in radio, for the last five years, I've had a great deal of access to statistics, broadcast magazines, variety publication, all kind of money thin agencies. And I've come to the conclusion that the Black population is a highly audio population. They listen to a lot of entertainment programs and a lot of the information they get comes through the entertainment media. And I remember once doing an interview with the with the Soul Brother Number One, who's now referred to as the Godfather of Soul

00:04:22.751
James Brown [together]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:24.070
another wanted to Brown voice

Sam Clark 00:04:25.481
and I said I asked him, I says Where did you get the courage to do your record, "Say it Loud I'm Black and I'm proud." So I said. don't you think that would finish you in the business. He says no. And I said what do you hope to accomplish about that. He says when I see my brothers and sisters with very little education dancing away on the floor, I want them to get some kind of educational message that they could get through to them why they are partying and at the same time I am satisfied and they're satisfied and somehow I'm helping my people. So I kept that in mind and I decided that one of the good ways to get history across, would be to put it on the record and to do it in such a way that they would listen to it. You know it's not a strict narration. It's sort of a comparative type of narration. I talk about history, but yet I make it very contemporary.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:15.610
Well in talking about this bicentennial and Black contributions you look at 200 years of history it's a long time one and a short time on the other hand, and within that there are a number of areas you can choose distress. You can go back to 1619 Jamestown colony when Blacks first came over. You could deal with some of the pre-revolutionary aspects of Black life, the fact that Blacks were involved in American to your life, many of them and gain their freedom. You could deal with Crispus Attucks. You can deal with Salem poor and revolutionary war, you can deal with James Allen and Amy Amy church. You can deal with Benjamin Banneker and so on. How do you make a decision, in terms of a record as to which of these many very very significant things you're going to put onto the wax.

Sam Clark 00:06:06.930
Well I'm, you know I'm so happy that you said that because my first record deals with history and some of the people, and I really stress only some of the Black things. Some of the things that Black people have done over the years you know which is good because if this record meets it some success I can go into part two and part three. And believe me there's enough history on the Black accomplishments for the four or five hundred years that we've been here depending on your point of view or –the amount of historic information you have that Black folks have been doing and I can you know [stammering] and you know if necessary I can do an album, I can take it back to Africa.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:49.050
Because you made an interesting point, namely that the Black community is very audio oriented, very radio oriented.

Sam Clark 00:06:56.200
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:56.851
Which is one reason why some of the Black stations are so popular, back, I guess in every city around the country there is a significant Black station is very very popular. And of course they do play a lot of music. Now your record is a record which involves sort of a narration over music of a military bicentennial type. To what extent do you think this is really going to be played on a Black station or the white station for that matter? Because basically it's a message that every American Black or white should know about, should learn about, the world. What is the reaction? I know this is one of the first times we've really that men to putting this on the air. But what do you expect to be the reaction to this record?

Sam Clark 00:07:43.801
Well that normally is a sticky question to answer because you don't want to offend people that you may have to deal with. You see. But since we're gone, you know, we've been on it so far so let's just keep it that way. This record is a surprise to a lot of white people when they hear it. It's such a surprise the way I compare it and it leaves them with no point to criticize after they hear it they can't say or you're wrong. So when they hear it, and if they've been in disagreement they now can no longer disagree with something. And you're putting a person in the position to [stutters] play something to listen to something that you can't disagree with. So it's kind of hot and you must keep in mind too when you're talking to radio stations even if you say Black radio stations they're owned my white people nine times. You know I mean I would say maybe out of the thousand or 2000 radio stations in the country, we're lucky if we own 50. Lucky. And I think that's doubtful.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:42.210.0000000000582
And that privates– thats pretty high.

Sam Clark 00:08:44.551
Right.

00:08:45.441
The question though,h ow do you go about getting a record onto a station?

Sam Clark 00:08:49.380
Well your record company takes that. You see I'm on the DCA record label here in New York and they have other famous artists such as Gloria Gaynor, and others and they have a working relationship with these record companies across the country. So it's up to them to talk to the program and music director to convince them to put this on the air and they have to conduct a market study where this would go and I'm confident as it starts to move out you're going to find that white educators will buy this for their classrooms as well because a lot of white teachers teach Black students.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:21.850
Of course one thing that the bicentennial has done, even though the premise might be a little weak in terms of America a place of total freedom, is to rekindle some of the interest in Black history. We have Black bicentennial bicentennial calendars. We now have a Black by center new record. We will probably have a film coming along somewhere along the way. We have books which now are beginning to come out, that people are looking at; so that I do feel that even though the bicentennial celebration might be based on somewhat of a foggy premise as far as Black Americans are concerned, it is a time where people like yourself and people like myself and others can do something about informing white people, but particularly Black people about Black history. So now let us hear this record by Sam Clark, "Black Americans."

Sam Clark's "Black Americans" 00:10:16.651
[Music begins] The Black man is still fighting the United States government. To enforce its laws that states all men are created equal. Well this is one Black American who's going to speak out. The Black man in this country has answered every call to duty. He died for America in World War One. He died for America in World War Two. He died for America in Korea. And he died for America in Vietnam. Why in fact, the first man to die in this country's revolutionary war of 1776, was a black man named Crispus Atticus. So why does America say to us, we have to wait for better jobs. Better housing. Better education. And now we see the government overlooking the flow of drugs that are running in the veins of the Black kids. Whose fathers sacrifice their lives for this country. Wow. Sir Winston Churchill was proclaiming his finest hour, In World War 2, When the Royal Air Force defended England against the German air force. And added that never was so much owed to so you. I wonder, did he ever once say, that a large number of those pilots. And he r a f. What Black. Well England, how much is owed to them? Some say It's been one hundred years since the Black man was three. Well, I don't know about that. But I do know, slaves were brought here for a source of good cheap labor. It was so good that the North started something called the Civil War. Well, if we are such a good source of labor why is it that the United States government hasn't declared war on the construction industry and the unions for not giving Blacks their fair share of the jobs. Some people say that we Blacks have no right to complain. Because we contributed nothing in the way of scientific knowledge that has made this country great. Well, a man by the name of George Washington Carver developed several industries from peanut. And get this –every time a rich executive gets heart trouble, he should keep this in mind. That if it wasn't for a Black man, by the name of Daniel Hale Williams. Who performed the phrase successful open heart surgery. That his heart trouble might be his last trouble. And if that is not significant enough. Maybe, this is. The most powerful bomb ever developed in the world, and America's most important project, The Manhattan Project. The development of the atom bomb was assisted by two Black men. William Nutt and Junior Wilkins. The great faith of the North Pole was Grace reached by a Black man named Matt Hinson. No, America is not beautiful. Not until she protects all of her people, can she speak of democracy or brotherhood. Now don't get us wrong, we still love America. You know why? Because country grants everyone the right to the pursuit of happiness

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:36.263
And that's Sam Clark's new record, "Black Americans," the first bicentennial record about Blacks and Black history. The record is by DCA records. It can be obtained by calling 5 4 1 5 9 8 0. You certainly covered a number of themes of Black history in that racket and as I was saying how do you make the decision as to which themes you were going to cover?

Sam Clark 00:15:02.720
Well I tell you the decisions came out of present day criticism about Blacks. Some of the things that Blacks have been doing. What you –primarily the criticism. Now we get a lot of complaints that Blacks if they're not working, they're on welfare and the general feeling is that the week since welfare is there we take it. We don't try to go up the ladder. If only Blacks would go up the ladder there'd be no problem. So I figured I want to examine that. There was a time – you know the whole concept – all right – you want to call the shot that we were brought here to pick cotton. All right, so be it. Now that digging ditches and picking cotton or doing any kind of manual labor once you became unionized, all of a sudden we lost our jobs. Now some people talk about well Blacks can't get in the unions because they don't have seniority. Well the whole joke of senior – it's a joke. If you speak to seniority, what happens the seniority of the last 400 years? Meanwhile, you know a foreigner, and I do mean a foreigner can come to this country and probably get a job in a union without even speaking English in two weeks. And you've been here for 400 years and you still have to prove yourself. It's ridiculous to have a demonstration. It's ridiculous to have to go to Washington and talk about seniority. I mean just last year-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:14.373
You make your point very clearly and I can't – I think that's one of the things that comes out of examining the role of Blacks in the 200 of the 400 year history of the United States; and that is that a lot of the country was built on the backs of Black people. And as you say that the Black people did put in their apprenticeship. The thing that I find interesting about the racket, is that it does highlight in very dramatic fashion the fact that Blacks have been in the wars, they've been in the battles, they have made significant contributions in science, and in industry, and in business. As well as the usual contributions in sports and music and and drama that we hear about. And I think it's very important highlight some of those. And as you were saying earlier you probably have enough to do an album that draw on black contributions in history or to albums or three albums.

Sam Clark 00:17:08.290.9999999998836
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:08.901.0000000001164
Because we have now 28 million blacks, which is larger than all but about six or seven countries in the entire world.

Sam Clark 00:17:16.722
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:17.001
So that is a tremendous repository of contributions and history that Black people have gone through it can easily be translated. But the question I'd like to ask you Sam, because you have been in the media, former reporter for WNYC, and now doing freelance work. What really can be done to make the mass media more responsive to the area of Black history? I meant just talking about Black people but Black history because Black history is really such a neglected area. I think CBS once did a show narrated by –on television– by Bill Cosby, called Black history law straight are stolen. And he picked up some of the more obvious stereotypes, but that was just a drip in the bucket as it were, not even a drop-

Sam Clark 00:18:04.046
That's right, that's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:05.990
-What can be done to make mass media more responsive to areas of Black history?

Sam Clark 00:18:10.460
Well I think it's, it's a question when we have Blacks who know a great deal about Black history. I mean I just briefly talked with you today and I've learned something, even about you. And you brought up significant point. I don't talk about myself, I stay within the present you know. Well I think what you've done, and I know you want to promote it but I'm going to say it anyway. You know being the first man to shoot down a jet airplane and World War Two I think is significant. And I don't think you have to parade on it, but I think you should have a little section, a little biography about yourself, and it should be sent out to all the newspapers and to all the communication establishments. Now I think to really specialize on this being that it's it's such a problem reaching the media. There is a Black newspaper association and I think they can get together and just compile a record of that, and see that it's sent out. Now, don't kid yourself. Whites, some whites, on the very top [stammering] are more aware of Black history than you realize, and some of my so aware of it they're threatened. They feel they feel threatened by it. Let's put it that way. And until they get to know it and deal with it we just have to keep it in front of them. You know?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:21.371
Of course one of the things about Black history or about history viewed from a Black perspective is that a number of the things that we celebrate in the bicentennial for example, writing of the Constitution, have very severe racist connotations. I mean three fifths of a man provision in the constitution which in counting bodies for the electorate counted Black slaves as three fifths of a man. The fact that the Constitution allowed to continue and the slave trade in certain areas of the country for 20 years after the Constitution certainly blotches on American history which a number of people don't know about and probably a larger number don't want to know about. Similarly the fact that Black people have always fought for their freedom, actively, not just with arms, but politically, with very astute politicians. People like Frederick Douglass for example, who were great politicians. It's true that many people know about Frederick Douglass but they don't know the work that he did. The fact that he was a counsel to President Lincoln, the fact that he was the one who really finally got the Union troops to pay Black soldiers the same amount of money as they paid white soldiers into the long period of time for that to happen. Well these are things that are just not covered. And then of course some of the more dramatic stories in Black history, the story of many of the heroes of the Civil War, for example. Or the stories of the heroes of the Spanish American War, or the stories of men like Daniel Hale Williams operating in private in hospital in Chicago.

Sam Clark 00:20:58.061
And you mentioned-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:58.841
-those are things that that need to be projected, but somehow or another they don't get done. Not much white history gets projected either except that the media basically reflects what you might call white America.

Sam Clark 00:21:11.351
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:11.931
Oh – what does other things that you'd like to see done to make this Black history more alive, bring it more to the public?

Sam Clark 00:21:19.450
Well I like to see more TV programs that include this Black History and this goes back to a little earlier point that you were making on an earlier show of yours that I was listening to where the guest was Cliff Frazier and he was talking about producers in the power that they had. Once you see more black producers or directors in key positions you're going to see more black history. Now on NBC on its TV counterpart, has a little bicentennial running. And I'm sure as time goes on you're going to see little segments on what the Blacks have done.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:56.190
And I hope you will-

Sam Clark 00:21:57.011
-Well I should hope-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:57.940
that there's one of the points-

Sam Clark 00:21:59.052
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:59.053
That license renewal and the pressure of Blacks to do. The problem with much of what appears in the mass media is that usually Black history runs down to Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, and maybe Charles Drew and the blood bank. And that really becomes all a Black history without dealing with many, for example, most people in America, who most Black people aren't aware of the fact that there were Blacks serving in the United States Senate in 1870. They just don't know that there were two Blacks serving in the United States Senate and I'm aware of that.

Sam Clark 00:22:36.703
Here's something else too. You know we we think of integration in terms of what Lincoln did in emancipating the slaves. And we think of George Washington the father of our country now. This is a speculation history ,which someone has brought to my attention, but they haven't been able to quite document that yet. But I think it's speculation on the part of experts so I'm going to talk about it. I've been told, since my record came out that it really wasn't – integration really didn't begin with George Washington in 1777, all with Crispus Attucks. It began with a British general by name is Lord Nelson, when he was attacked in America. He went to the Blacks and said if you fight with me I'll see when the war is over that you have all your freedom. George Washington, to my understanding as I was told, didn't want Blacks in our army-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:25.591
Washington-

Sam Clark 00:23:26.490
Oh now Lord Lord Nelson0-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:28.031
Lord Dunmore. Oh you love me too. He was a governor – the British governor of Virginia – and of course there was a battle between the white British is in and way the American colonialists, colonies, and Lord Dunmore offered to anybody [Clark interjects] I said it wasn't Nelson, that day he was the man who applied the seas the Caribbean, but it was Lord Dunmore who offered any Black who fought for the British freedom. And it was that particular maneuver that forced the Continental Army, forced Washington, and is compared to say to Blacks, all right if you fight -after- you fight we'll see about giving you freedom. actually-

Sam Clark 00:24:07.080
-but didn't those slaves perform-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:08.741
-oh the soldiers-

Sam Clark 00:24:09.552
Well perform, Black soldiers perform [Dr. Brown interjects] well before Washington considered them a threat.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:13.720
Well-

Sam Clark 00:24:14.231
was that- was that accurate?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:14.923
Theres two levels on that. Remember that the Revolutionary War covers from all the way up and Connecticut and Massachusetts, all the way down to South airline and Georgia. So as a result the basic racist split still existed. That the Northern states were more willing for Blacks to serve, because in many instances the colonists paid people, white and Black, to serve for them in the war. And it wasn't the classic war where you mobilize an army and they stay in the army. There'd be a battle here and they would mobilize some troops they'd go and fight for three or four months and then they would become demobilized and they'd go back to their regular jobs. Well many times the merchant and so on didn't want to take time away from this and they would hire mercenaries, they would hire people to go and fight for them. And this is -where -the way in which- many of the Blacks first began to fight on the side of the North or in the Northern part of the revolution. Whereas in Southern plantations, mostly Blacks, were working until in the soil. And so as a result they didn't want them to be away from the soil. So you get that dichotomy there, and Washington just said that he just didn't feel that Blacks had the intelligence or the courage to fight. Well when Lord Dunmore came up with his proposition several Blacks two or three hundred went over and joined him -They made him more that- maybe it was more up to a thousand- join the British. And with the prospect of gaining a freedom of course a British one. Now that put the American revolutionary people right on the spot and they had to come back with a counter offer. And a counter offer was that if they fought for a certain period of time successfully that at the end of the war they would get their freedom. Actually some of these bargains were well known and not all Blacks who fought in the revolution got their freedom. Many of them were free and then had to go back to their slave status at the end of the war to try to negotiate their freedom again.

Sam Clark 00:26:11.620
But that was the first step sort of any kind of recognition of Blacks would you say?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:15.102
I would say in a real sense it was now one thing that from a historical point of view as a historian you, commentate you should know and that is the Rhode Island Blacks.R hode Island organized a regiment of 700 Black soldiers who fought right around New York City as a matter of fact some of them actually fought in the Battle of Long Island and fought very courageously I might add. Some of them fought the battle of Stony Point. So that there is certainly clear evidence in the Muster Rolls and so on that Black soldiers fought in the revolution and many of them were free. Many of them conducted themselves with great valor probably the number one hero at Bunker Hill was a Black soldier by name Salem Poor who was extolled mightily for his courageous efforts in slaying the major – British Major Pitcairn at the Battle of Bunker Hill. So there is tremendous amount, and this goes back literally over two hundred years. And then of course the thing that I think we ought to deal with are some of the ramifications of some of the historic things. For example it was alleged that the Emancipation Proclamation freed Blacks. Well it didn't really. What it did was to free Blacks in any areas which were slave holding areas where the Union Army took over. But it's still allowed blacks who in the Northern states were slaves to be slaves. And it's still largely how the Blacks who were slaves in the South to still be slaves. So that it was more of a symbolic freedom than an actual freedom. These are things that really should be cleared up in media now. True enough you can't say all of that on the record but these type of things that ought to be looked at.

Sam Clark 00:27:59.471
This is what-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:59.950
-our early Black heroes an hour later Black heroes, for example, in music field, Scott Joplin is now being recognized because of his fantastic contributions to ragtime and the fact that he his music was used as the basis of the theme for "The Sting." These are little things which collectively can be built in. Well as we come to the conclusion of a program Sam, what are some of the things you plan to do after this record, "Black Americans," takes over?

Sam Clark 00:28:26.350
Well hopefully if it takes over what I'd like to do is essentially some of the things that you have and I talked about and to bring it – other historical perspectives on tape. And this is my aim.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:38.591
All right, our guest on tonights "Soul of Reason" has been Sam Clark who has just done a record on Black history and the bicentennial, a DCA record entitled "Black Americans." Thanks again for being our guest on solar reason Sam.

Sam Clark 00:28:52.151
Thanks a million Roscoe.
