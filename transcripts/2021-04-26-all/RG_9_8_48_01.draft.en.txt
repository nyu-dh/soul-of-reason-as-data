Speaker 1 00:00:01.450
1976 200 years after the Declaration of Independence is the occasion of the bicentennial celebration of our nation's birth. Ron good draw and Bob Williams of The New York City bicentennial corporation will tell us about New York City's exciting celebration of our two hundredth anniversary on tonight. Soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:41.150
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:07.750
With us tonight on soul of reason. Ron good draw and Bob Williams of The New York City bicentennial Corporation. And I'd like to begin the show by asking you Ron exactly what is the New York City bicentennial your bicentennial corporation. What are its goals and how does it operate.

Speaker 4 00:01:23.670
And I might add who are you.

Speaker 5 00:01:26.630
I'm Ron illegal Drew and I'm the executive vice president and the New York City bicentennial corporation has a lot of words when you're trying to speed it out. You certainly say that five times fast the corporation is the officially designated organization for coordinating New York's participation in events leading up to and following the two hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. It's a little bit difficult to define the bicentennial as just 76 although we've called our theme focus 76 historically as you know it 1765 to 1789. The corporation works through a board of directors of 45 15 appointed by the mayor. Fifteen appointed by the city council and 15 by a group called the New York City shrine's associates. This is not the Shriners are individuals who have long been associated with the preservation of our shrines in the national shrines in New York City of which you as we get into the program we'll find that there are many many many of them all through the city. Yes more and the more positively we hope that one in particular. Hamilton Grange will be certainly restored and in working condition and that is in Harlem.

Speaker 3 00:02:38.080
It certainly is now and number one black community in a sense in terms of our historic number one black community. But of course as we found when we looked over in Bedford Stuyvesant weeks ville we have some black settlements that go back to pre revolutionary days.

Speaker 5 00:02:54.110
Well you also have on Staten Island one of the oldest black communities and it was a carry of moist fishermen who came in from the south North Carolina and then ended up on the coast shipwrecked and established a community there.

Speaker 3 00:03:08.690
One of the fantastic things about New York City is its history and because in a sense we are part of the cradle of our democracy. Even though Philadelphia likes to claim that the fact is that so much of what developed in the revolutionary days and in the days of the founding of the country including the first capital really was right here in New York right down by what we call City Hall et cetera. Now Bob Williams you've been with us well untold reason before both in your capacity as Executive Director of the sports foundation and also as director of community relations I believe it is community pro community programs for the New York City bicentennial Corporation now exactly what is your responsibility with the corporation.

Speaker 6 00:03:52.580
Well my responsibility is to help the corporation make this a real people's celebration. We have tools in the community planning boards as our basic structure because it encompasses every geographic area of the city all five boroughs number one. I hate to use the word assume but I am a plant Planning Board member myself in Harlem and planning board nine and I know that our group likes to say that it is a character rather selflessly a cross-section of the community and we could certainly synthesize any ideas and galvanize the religious ethnic youth all people the various services etc. All of the community and at the end it is a little I political because it is a direct linkage to the borough presidents and that in that way as we do generate proposals and the programs from the communities they must get the borough president endorsement and that way we show that we are doing this in a harmonious fashion and not trying to dissipate energy or work across purposes.

Speaker 7 00:04:54.890
But of course I would say categorically that the only political benefits out of this are to the entire city and politicians of any particular persuasion because basically the things that we do are to explore our heritage and to explore our history and in a sense to see where we've been over these past 200 years.

Speaker 8 00:05:14.940
Ron I don't believe the purpose of the bicentennial celebration regardless of who's in power and I guess at least at the present time publicans in power nationally I don't think it has a political purpose. I think it basically is a reflective and historical and analytical purpose particularly looking at our shrines and our symbols and our heritage. Is that a correct perception or my but it is correct.

Speaker 9 00:05:42.080
In an ideal I think that we if you if you trace the the bicentennial throughout the country that you'll find a different character from city to city state to state.

Speaker 5 00:05:54.680
And unfortunately nationally we have had a slightly different kind of character that has seriously jeopardized the bicentennial efforts on a national basis. And what is that particular problem and is Jeff a problem as you may recall is that there were all all kinds of questions of influence giving when the bicentennial was first formed that the bicentennial was really a rip off that was going to be used by Nixon as his last great stand before he left office and handed his crown to somebody else. Exactly the same but symbolic use of Crown is indicative of some other thoughts. Well this is I wouldn't said we tore down the statue of George of King George in lower Manhattan maybe that's what's going to happen in 17 1976 here. But I would say that categorically the the corporation is an independent entity unlike other cities bicentennial. It is not part of the mayor's office. It is an extension of city government insofar as most of our funding comes from the city. We had an understanding with the city originally that the administrative funds for the running of the Bicentennial should come from the city that the program funds. We would look for some other sources.

Speaker 6 00:07:09.350
This has caused some difficulty because it's difficult to raise program funds in that kind of economy we're in now but I add a lot to be that we are also programmed to self-destruct in 1977. We feel that our work for the official period would be over the official period is May 75 to November 76. So we'll tie up all the loose ends by then. The second thing is again you know when you think about a people's celebration of Toronto and I was speaking all the way over and I respect this position because I must really public relate any way you slice it to truly to the various communities and the message that I try to live whose lives that we have such a rich heritage of revolutionary type memorabilia if you will. OK. We have found over one hundred and forty structures that pre-date eighteen hundred and also some 40 or so cemeteries. And I think that if you think about if you just think about the significance of where there's no money involved just simply a spirit of patriotism at this particular point to make the significance of the democratic way of life.

Speaker 8 00:08:14.770
So one of the things that I perceive out of the analysis of the revolution is that patriotism does involve criticism. I think his history will reflect that.

Speaker 7 00:08:25.240
It literally was a minority of people in the so-called colonies at that time that really supported the revolutionary efforts.

Speaker 10 00:08:37.669.9999999999418
And as we now find minorities of various types sometimes women sometimes Native American sometimes blacks sometimes Hispanics challenging the system.

Speaker 7 00:08:48.380
I think it's important for us to become aware of the fact that we came from a revolutionary tradition ourselves where a minority of people in a sense an educated minority or insightful minority led this great revolution that we've been going through and further to sort of self examine ourselves to say well look here are some things that we started out to accomplish that maybe we haven't accomplished as well as we might. So that does lead to a I'll use the term quasi political inference but I think you've made it very clear that basically the purpose is and to perpetuate Nixon or beam or anybody else. The main purpose is to give us some reflection to look in to where we've been.

Speaker 11 00:09:36.770
Your comment about reflection is is one of the major areas that we've we really feel is the most important one is the reassessment of where we are in terms of where we've been and where we're going. And that brings in the whole question of people who are not here back in those days when we found cemeteries or or pre eighteen hundred houses there were a number of people who would be disenfranchised by the bicentennial s activities. If we were to focus only on creating hundred period. One of the things that we've said when we've gone out is that whether it be black or Hispanic there is pride in the ethnic heritage of those peoples. And that by sharing it and using the bicentennial as the occasion to share everyone's past.

Speaker 12 00:10:23.060
Collectively in terms of the history of 200 years or individually by group to share with others in your group those proud traditions. And I think that has been one of the exciting things to begin to see this whole feeling of ethnicity begin to grow and that the melting pot theory why having value in one respect in terms of our all motivating our forces to defend the country when it's right criticized the country where it's wrong is the idea that there are individual diverse elements within the society that are important to look at.

Speaker 13 00:10:56.930
Excellent. I think that you know that is really the bottom line with regard to what the community project of the spirit of the community project is all about. What we're saying is this let's take a historical focus on two levels. First of the revolutionary time and then let's look at the modern community that you live in. What you. What do you define as your community number one. And then what is the ethnic sociological. What is the economic evolution that has taken place. You know what are the significant things that we should document in this particular community.

Speaker 14 00:11:27.630
I think that one of the things that I was impressed with out in Brooklyn was the fall guy. So when I was in bed stay at a sports Limited was speaking about what does this mean to black youth. What does the bias until you watch black youth. Their answer is this that there are cemeteries there is a cemetery in Brooklyn in the Greenpoint section I believe if I'm not mistaken where there are black Haitian Patriots buried and young people should know that that it was not just Christmas attics. That's right in the American Revolution it was not just Francis Harvard that there is a rich ethnic history of all Americans participating in in the fight for democracy and the maintenance of democracy because traditionally blacks as well as whites have died in all the wars that we've had to defend this country.

Speaker 1 00:12:23.010
One of the things that you've done is to involve a number of people and I might say that I'm proud to be on the historical committee of New York City bicentennial corporation to do just this tremendous job there is to do a lot of searching out for example just tracing the history of the black community in New York City from down around City Hall to manage village and Bleecker Street to San Juan Hill to Harlem to bed sty and a number of people blacks as well as whites aren't unaware of this type of I'll use the term diaspora of black people throughout New York City. The same thing is true of Puerto Rican people of Haitian peoples Dominican people of Chinese people as well as the Diaspora Jews Irish government etc.. Now we are talking tonight on soul of reason with Ron Boudreau and Bob Williams of the New York City bicentennial corporation and they're telling us about the scope and meaning of what the bicentennial celebration in 1976 will be.

Speaker 15 00:13:24.350
Now Ron possibly you could run down with us some of the specific things that you plan to do.

Speaker 4 00:13:31.380
I mean beyond putting patches on the sleeves of the Mets and the Yankees and the Jets and the Rangers and the sets and nets and a few other people what else you got to do. We hadn't even thought of that but now that you mention that I'm going to write it right down. How about that.

Speaker 12 00:13:51.420
Let me put in context the the planning themes. We have heritage festival and Horizon as three major themes for the bicentennial. Let's run that down. Heritage is that which points to the past perhaps we call it a dateline 1776 festival. What we commemorate today that's 1976 75 76. And then horizon which is the most exciting portion of the bicentennial is pointing to the future the third century 20 76 20 76. And that ties into a major theme for the city focused 76.

Speaker 15 00:14:27.750
Very well very well thought out very well developed. Now what are some of the exciting things that going to happen here. Well I know some of our viewers like to get in on this and I'd be calling Bob Williams at about at the Byzantine Centennial to check this out. And by the way before the program is over maybe you could give us a phone number or a contact point where various community groups and folks were interested in participating in the bicentennial. Good call. Well let's do that now. Where would they get in touch for 9 0 8 5 6 so in New York City 1 9 0 8 5 6 6 0 is the phone number of the Bicentennial Corporation in what is the address is at 355 Lexington Avenue three five Lexington Avenue zip is 1 0 1 7 new york 100 1 7 right 117 I think it's important because this really is something taking the thing both Ron and Bob have projected name.

Speaker 16 00:15:29.660
This is a people's celebration and it is not a celebration of the establishment of political economic and have it. It just shouldn't be it could certainly move into that so therefore we want and I'm sure as you've been talking before the show have emphasized this point you want the people of New York to be involved in the communities of New York to be involved. Now we have identified that you welcome and hope but as a result of this show and others that people will contact you I'm going to knock down your doors. What are the things you're going to have them do when they knock down your doors.

Speaker 9 00:16:03.140
Well we hope when they knock on the doors that they're going to have some very specific and concrete ways in which they think they can participate or that they have a proposal or a project. And as Bob indicated before we have a mechanism set up so that they don't even have to come to us. They could go through that look Community Planning Board if they're in school they can go through there. The Board of Education or the local school the program in the city is so complex in terms of structure that I won't go into details except almost every single institution in the city has been contacted whether it be education or StoryCorps cultural or religious science. And if you go to New York City hospital you can ask for someone and they have a bicentennial liaison person. So no matter where you are there's a place for you. But specific kinds of programs that have emerged in terms of large scale small scale. We have discussed with them and I now specifically related to the black community for purposes of this program. On the first one we had a black cultural retrospective program. And when we first met with represented some 110 black cultural institutions we suggested to them that there should be several ways in which the black community could become involved. And this does not mean that they're not involved in other programs or committees because we have to cut right across. But we separated them out. They decided that they'd focus attention around significant things that were going to happen or could happen. We discussed the whole Johnson museum which will probably be erected in the Bronx. And what kind of festival Dance Theater activities could occur around the opening cornerstone laying or what will ever what will occur if this gets off the ground. The same thing with we all hope the Schoenberg collection will be housed properly. And if we don't have a full house we'll have the groundbreaking by then. And that with the county Colin could be an activity surrounding those two in a very moving exciting and meaningful exhibition program.

Speaker 14 00:18:01.190
I'd like to just get into it because when we saw that we spoke to a green Hudson the point that that was made easy.

Speaker 1 00:18:07.520
She's a curator curator of the Assad regime is the greatest museum of Black works in the country. Yeah. Library dash museum of black work in the country.

Speaker 13 00:18:16.380
And it's sitting there in boxes and just not available to the public and people are very concerned about it. And we feel as though this is somebody that is not just a planning board to problem or a Harlem problem we feel that this is a significant collection that should have certainly citywide not national or worldwide attention. And I just like to make that appeal on behalf of the Schomburg the money is in the capital budget has to be shaken loose and the conformity that they're actually for with regard to a three phase proposal is there and we just don't see what the problem is.

Speaker 16 00:18:53.290
Now in terms of the specific relationship with the bicentennial the idea is that these cultural institutions that exist in New York City in the black community Hispanic community what have you should be given the opportunities to both reflect on what they've done and to dramatize their needs and possibly in a thematic way do something in their programs that reflect this. This could be in the form of concerts. It could be in the form of exhibits. It could be in the form of plays it could be in the form of of travelling groups. It'd be in the form of all star sports games a variety of things. It looks to me as though you both have your hands full and trying to get this together feeling as Ron said with the complexity of New York City governmental as well as agency bureaucracy and being that I'm now move to ask is What is your timetable. When will the public begin to hear about specific things that you're going to do at specific times.

Speaker 9 00:19:56.660
Well he may have heard about it already. I don't know if you recall it on April 22nd was the 200 anniversary of the New York City Tea Party a little known seldom commemorated event. We call that Bicentennial Town Meeting Day and throughout the city in maybe some 30 different locations. They had bicentennial town meetings and Bob you can relate the one that occurred in Harlem. And a couple of other places. Well yeah we worked with Roger Fermin at the Black Repertory Theatre and we've encouraged him to sort of develop a bicentennial presentation that could possibly be a roving theater going into various communities in various states with sort of open ended chapters if you will or.

Speaker 13 00:20:43.000
What you will you go into play ex that you can adapt to the specific communities that are going to. So that's one of the things that a traveling theater 78 with with a bicentennial theme you know he did the the the series on the on blacks. One hundred years of blacks would have needed a black book on the Black Keys that Roger was on our program discussing that I.

Speaker 3 00:21:04.570
He was describing as a memorabilia about blacks all over the place. Yes. That are easily available and not necessarily easily available. They now are easily available because a book like The Black Book but still with some research and with some effort they could be pulled together in a very meaningful fashion.

Speaker 13 00:21:21.010
I went to a real town meeting. There were a couple of real good ones. There were two a real tell me the up in the Bronx. It was in the south grounds in the Trinity Avenue and they were discussing the plans that Ron had been there earlier and they discussed their priorities well their priorities was to get a good showboat to come and dock at the appear and they want to develop the pier area and we have a project called Water edges. There were about 580 or so miles of water in a waterway in New York City a circle encircle New York City and we have endeavoured to try to develop some prototypical plans for various waterfront areas and to encourage activities in those in those areas and the Trinity Street Pier. Ron Tiffany Tiffany productivity Street pier and the Browns was developed in conjunction with that idea along with the Parks Association so they will viewing those almost finalized plans that it was a very very active meeting they had people from the hospital represented from Prospect hospital were there. They got the whole medical program. These are programs that will not cost anything these are all in kind things but the kind of spirit that was generated to to have people help themselves and do the kinds of things that will have a lasting effect. You know when you when you when you do a medical examinations the initial examination is not the most important it's the follow up and how you follow up. How do you get to the period. How do you directly get the child to move again. And these are the kinds of things that we are very sincerely committed to try to develop.

Speaker 8 00:22:56.410
Now of course this suggests that the hardest part of your task is going to be this your horizons. In other words where do we go in the future. How do you plan to attack that. Because obviously much of where we have to go in the future is going to be determined by the demands of society the resources that are available and new ways of organizing these resources which does despite our earlier statement put us far closer to the political arena than to the historical arena.

Speaker 9 00:23:27.040
Well the the historical arena was a political arena. I suppose I can cop out by saying that but the horizon one even though it's the most difficult is the most exciting of course because for some communities they have nothing but their future their past has been bleak and their present is bleak and their community show signs of hope. Why we use the community planning board structure is that this is about the second or third year that this program is taking off.

Speaker 11 00:23:56.110
They're beginning to sense and taste local government. This is having a very salutary effect upon the community that they now feel they have an input using this as a stepping stone. We think that they can come up with a declaration of aspirations and the kind of thing that their community wants.

Speaker 7 00:24:12.580
That's very clever. I think it's very important.

Speaker 11 00:24:15.340
A declaration of aspiration aspirations are good point. And the reason and what we would hope would happen is that throughout the city we would be able to bundle these together on July 4th of 1976 and hand them to the mayor and to the appropriate city officials say this is your community speaking out during a time of reflection. This is the aspirations and some are modest in some instances. They just want certain kinds of things. Others are more ambitious and others a full scale masterplan for the development of the community. We think this is the kind of appropriate gift that these citizens today can give to the future of New York. And while people say you know that sounds like a lot of rhetoric what we hope will happen is that they will follow up on what they've suggested because the community boards become stronger than they are now. They will be able to follow up on several of the programs and see some of them implemented the next 10 years maybe in the next two or three years.

Speaker 7 00:25:12.670
It's very interesting as you develop this and I think of the early history of the Bicentennial as a concept the national history that was what was going to be sort of extolling of King Richard and and so on. How will you establish a rapprochement and articulation with the national program. Are you really saying that your program is so meaningful and so important for New York City that the national focus is going to have to catch up with you.

Speaker 11 00:25:43.170
Yes that's a great question. No it's not because I hold another position I'm chairman of the fourth city bicentennial Federation which is bicentennial planners from Boston Washington Philadelphia New York which are really where the key cities right. And why we have banded together is that we believe we're the national backup system for the bicentennial that there has not been significant leadership or money from Washington. Our own program is is is a New York City needs program. What is good for New York City good if we do a good job in New York City in terms of what residents think the bicentennial in the meaning of the bison. We don't worry about tourists because a happy New Yorker is like a happy householder when he's going to have guests his guests are going to enjoy being there they're going to see things they never saw before and it may be a whole new spirit is being developed. I might also say we have a different kind of mayor. A mayor who has gone on record as saying that he is very much of the people that he's willing to walk in the streets to show that he's there even if it's a symbolic thing. If many communities were to do the same thing and they'd walk in their streets and they'd be serious about the kinds of things that are going on there. That's a very positive kind of approach and maybe the bicentennial is just that kind of opportunity we should seize to say let's use this as a target date. But 76 be the date when we have these things pulled together.

Speaker 7 00:27:09.800
I think that's a beautiful way of putting it together. Now Bob just as we come to the closing program do you have any particular thing you'd like to ask some of our viewers to do in terms of getting in touch and follow up. Yes.

Speaker 6 00:27:21.680
One to conform to our planning system certainly. Contact your local community local community planning boards are very important but the other thing that I think that we would like to emphasize is that this is not going to be Manhattan oriented. This is going to be in all of the boroughs. We are going to all of the boroughs. I happen to be a brown chauvinist and we have so many exciting proposals that we want to do with the Browns as well so it's going to be a people's celebration.

Speaker 15 00:27:44.490
OK. And folks who are interested in following up should contact their local planning board but they might call for 9 0 8 5 6 0 0 the New York City bicentennial Corporation. Our guest on tonight soul of reason have been Ron good and Bob Williams of the New York City bicentennial Corporation.
