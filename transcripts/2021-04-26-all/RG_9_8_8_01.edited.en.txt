Kind of serious drama about black family problems become a hit musical. Here, Virginia Capers star of the new hit musical "Raisin," tell us how it happened on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:01:10.830
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black box. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:37.901
With us tonight on "Soul of Reason" is Virginia Capers, star of the hit musical "Raisin," which is based on the famous Lorraine Hansberry play "A Raisin in the Sun." And the question that we were really talking about is how does it feel to be in a hit musical that has been developed from one of the greatest of the Black plays?

Virginia Capers 00:02:00.612
It feels great! It's absolutely divine.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:06.830
That is beautiful! You know you, you really sound like Lena Younger you know. You know it's really just it.

Virginia Capers 00:02:14.530
I imagine just to be in a hit play is exciting, but because we have so few opportunities, there is a special feeling of greatness, and in one essence, it is sad that I had to wait so long for this opportunity. That there were no roles written during the time that I was in my 20s, in my 30s that I could actually be the leading lady that's, in essence, a sad part, but then-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:47.672
That's part of the story "A Raisin In The Sun" it really is.

Virginia Capers 00:02:50.741
That's true, the waiting. And but it has come, and this moment is here, and it is divine. And the exciting thing about it is that the people who have been with me since time began in my life, meaning my family, my mother, my father, and of course my son coming much later in life, and my brother are all alive and well, and saw the birth of the person they know who's been struggling all this time when they say, "Go get a job."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:21.730
I have to admit that when I read the reviews, and I saw what they had to say about you, I said, "Wow, that is out of sight." And that really is, because what they've said about you in the play is, is something. And the thing that really has titillated my imagination is the creativity that it takes to translate. I consider "Raisin" to be probably among, if not the most meaningful Black play in terms of what we have been about. And to translate this with its sensitivity into a musical is really quite an accomplishment.

Virginia Capers 00:03:57.880
Well, you have to first take someone who had, who is interested. Now, Jed Walden, who's the Composer, started out, you know Ruth Bowen? Well, her husband. He started out in his band when he was 17 years old, playing with jazz musician Black jazz musicians. Now Judd is Jewish, but he played with those musicians all the way at the end of high school. And he came up in that society, and he is the type of man whose life is very intermingled with all people to begin with. On the other hand, Bob Britton, who is the Lyricist, his idol was Oscar Hammerstein. And he writes with very much of the sensitivity, sensitivity that Oscar Hammerstein used to write with. You know the phrasing and bringing together of words, taking the very meat of a paragraph and putting it into four rhythmical rhyming lines. So you get two young men like this who are not cocky to begin with but want to do a good job. Who sits down and work for two years before they present anything, and then hang in there for another eight years. Now that you have the love of the work preceding it all, and then the love of working coming next. And then you have people who are interested, and then a dream forms, and that dream happens, and it's the fulfillment and the creation of that dream into something real, something you can touch and feel and get warmth and light from. And of course, there is reason now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:50.102
See, those two words, love and work, are really two things that we deal with on "Soul of Reason" because, as a people, we have to love. We have to love each other, and we have to love what's about us. And it takes a heck of a lot of work to do the kind of things that we do in plays like Raisin or in whatever profession you're in. And that, that persistence that's, that's strength. And really that's the strength of Lena Younger, the mother in "Raisin", who kept this family moving through all of the historical wanderings of Walter Younger beneath her, and her boyfriend and so on. And that, that really is the strength of this. And one of the things that I have given some thought to as to whether things have really changed that much for Black families from the late 50s to now, because some people say, "well gee, we are past that." Past.

00:06:41.304
What?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:42.450
That's right. That's exactly the question.

Virginia Capers 00:06:46.990
There are obstacles in the middle of the road. There are things that we must endure. But you know I speak to young people at the schools, I go to schools like I was at Taff and I was at Satellite Academy, and I said when you choose a vocation don't choose something you don't love doing. I said but it's cause it's no fun to go to work. I said, but if there is something you enjoy doing, you can put 20, 30 years in it. Also, when you have a goal in mind, and you love that goal, and someone says, "Well listen, no one has ever done that before," or "You can't go there," or "You can't go there." You don't see that, that- that whatever they say goes over your head, and all you see is opening that door. And you open that door gently so that you don't disrupt that dream; you open that door in a way maybe you have to take the hinges off, you know. But you make a path, and you keep on burning through. It's 23 years for me to get this way. I started late in this business to begin with. I started when I was 24, 25 years old. And it has taken 23 years to get to be called a star of a Broadway show. Now I have been through bankruptcy. I have lost a home. I have lost a car. Then you would say, well why didn't you get a job, because nothing filled me as much as what I'm doing. And I figured well, maybe if I'm never a star, then to do something that is related in some way to my feel that I can love as much. And the vehicle happened, and I was relating all over the place, so to speak. But the idea is the 23 years are not wasted. The experience that I bring to the role is personal experience. The love that I have for the work, for my work, I bring into the show, and you can't be- [Crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:49.270
And the respect that you have for the people that you work with. [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:08:49.296
Oh, I respect the people that I -. First of all, I respect myself. I'm not going to do anything that hurts me. I'm not going to get drunk and come to work. I'm not going to be late and come to work. I'm not going to come in and say, "Oh well, we're going to walk through it today." No, I respect me. I respect my craft. I love my craft. Consequently, when I approach my job, it's not work; it's a joy.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:20.793
Because that's really what Black and beautiful is about. And speaking of beautiful things and some really beautiful music in "Raisin". And let's listen to one of the really uptempo ones, "Running to Meet The Man".

Virginia Capers 00:09:35.101
This is getting out to go to work in the morning.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:36.424
That's exactly what it's all about.

Running to Meet The Man 00:10:00.171
[Song "Running to Meet The Man]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:44.221
And how many Black people to run to meet the man?

Virginia Capers 00:12:46.820
Oh Lord, all you have to do is come out your house in the morning and you can see.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:51.684
And the words really are apocryphal. They really are.

Virginia Capers 00:12:55.690
And it's so true. You know it's, it's just this is a very interesting thing about this scene, when everybody starts coming out of the houses and through the steps and whatnot, and you see people getting ready, they're going to work, they're trying to catch the bus and everything and you, you're sitting in the audience, and it's become so real.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:14.360
If anybody's ever lived in New York or Chicago and you get that pace - [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:13:18.931
Anyplace sweetheart [Crosstalk]

Speaker 13 00:13:19.470
Well you're right, because it could be Memphis, or it could be New Orleans, or it can be the city - [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:13:24.020
Los Angles [Crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:24.023
L.A., because this really is the so-called hustle and bustle and what it takes for us to make it. Speaking of what it takes for us to make it, I was mentioning my record was playing, that is just so wonderful to see so many opportunities for Blacks. Not enough, but opportunities for Blacks to perform, and to choreograph, and to direct. And what about producing, are there many Blacks in the area of production?

Virginia Capers 00:13:52.122
Now ,you're on my sore foot. You know that, don't you? There is money in our community. We have businesses, and we have those people who have all kinds of dollars and cents and access to dollars and cents. All right, so maybe you don't want to do something alone on your own. All right then, so form a group. There, you know, I hear young people say well, the young white girls they can go out, and they can come up, and they can do this, and they can do that, and they don't have to have half the talent that we have. We've heard that a long time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:30.311
That's the long story. Right.

Virginia Capers 00:14:31.901
You know, before we can make it, we have to be, you know, second cousin to God, and whatever we have to do, or first cousin, however. But other people can be accepted on substandard basis. And I said well, what you're saying is, in essence, very true. Those of us who get through are fantastic, and there are a hundred more, times a hundred that are equally as fantastic and can't get through the door. But we have to produce our own. We have to become a production company. We have to invest the money. The Black doctors, the Black nurses, the Black teachers, the Black mothers, and fathers have to find every vehicle doesn't take two and three thousand dollars to get it. In fact, I understand one of the lowest investments in our show is 250 dollars.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:27.161
That's beautiful.

Virginia Capers 00:15:27.851
And realize it's paying money back, and a kid did it. You know a kid invested his summer savings in our show. This is when we were in Washington D.C. before the show ever came to Broadway, which of course it takes money to bring a show to Broadway. Our show cost 359,000 dollars to bring to Broadway. The average show cost a million dollars to bring to Broadway. And the substance of our story is so strong there was no way from the time I knew this was a musical, and it was going to go, I never even thought once that it could not be a hit. It never entered my mind. But we as Black people, if we are going to call it our own, we're going to do our own thing, then we've got to put our money where our mouth is. And what you're saying is that there is money, not necessarily a great deal, but there is money out there among Black People - [Crosstalk] There is money.Money makes money. [Crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:19.631
- Who if they wanted to, could invest. [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:16:21.220
Investment is the name of the game to make money. You know you work for a living, and that's all it's ever going to be, a living. When you start investing, that's when you live above the crest.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:32.860
Well, how does a person who is really serious about this, a Black person, hear about opportunities? How do they evaluate opportunities? Because you know the press is filled with stories of people who invested a million dollars in a Broadway show, and it lasted two nights.

Virginia Capers 00:16:49.780
Well you have to be careful -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:51.281
And that sorta scares people away.

Virginia Capers 00:16:52.361
That's true -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:53.181
Yet, on the other hand I'm sure some of us would like, actually become, if we haven't already, you know functioning involvement -

Virginia Capers 00:16:59.710
Let's stop and think about all the Black shows that have come to Broadway, what's in the past, what five, ten years. Everyone has been a hit.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:07.361.0000000001164
That's true.

Virginia Capers 00:17:07.781
All right. So true, maybe it's not a financial hit, but the reason it's not a financial hit is because, because of the PR is not done the same way. We are just becoming a theater, people. Well, it seemed to me that when I was a child, we were theater people; we went to the theater. You know we went to the theater, and suddenly there came a whole area where people went to movies instead of the theater, and we got away from it. But I remember going across to the Lafayette theater to see a show when I was four years old. You know, and - [Crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:38.331
Because that's the vibrance of culture in the Black community a lot of people forgotten that we always have. Ray Charles - [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:17:43.540
We wrote, we wrote Broadway shows you know- [Crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:47.052
Going all the way back to Weldon Johnson at the turn of the century.

Virginia Capers 00:17:48.711
Oh, tell me about it. You know, but the thing about it is that people have forgotten. They'll spend the same amount of money to go to see an Ike and Tina Turner concert, which I'm not putting down in any way, but what I'm trying to say is there is also another cultural experience out there, and it's an exciting experience, and it's something to see a live drama. It's also very interesting, in our theater you can always tell that people who are in the theater for the first time because they think they can talk to us like they talk to the screen.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:20.680
Right.

Virginia Capers 00:18:20.683
You know, and you're on stage, and they make these open comments, you know, and you can hear them loud and clear. And people are saying, "sh sh," you know, because you cannot talk to the players and in talking like that you may miss what's going on the stage. Sure there's moments of laughter, and of course, an actor learns, but there, when a play is about to be produced, nine times out of ten, there is someone going around, someone reputable, just not someone out of the clear blue sky, trying to get backing and they have what they call angel auditions. And what it is, is that they come and they present a capsule of the play, backers auditions are called.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:05.801
Yeah, that's it.

Virginia Capers 00:19:05.804
Yeah. And they, they present a capsule of the play. The music, all the drama, and highlights in the drama, and you sit around talk. Now you don't just say, "Ok, that's great man, here's my money." everything is done very legally and very aboveboard, and legitimate companies are formed. You know you don't just have somebody their money because you think this is a good play. But there are what they call-backers auditions, and people get into these backers auditions, and you can hear of them, but you have to become closer to the Broadway scene. There will be more jobs for us when there are more producers for us and -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:46.112
[Crosstalk] When there more producers, and more of us think about the fact that this is possible. And thinking about this fact, the song that we're about to play now, "Measure the Valley" - [Crosstalk]

Virginia Capers 00:19:56.440
Oh ,that's my song.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:56.444
Which you do in the play, would be something that would certainly turn on the backup.

Virginia Capers 00:20:00.951
Oh I hope so.

Measure the Valley 00:20:13.601
[Song "Measure the Valley"]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:09.150
You know that's really a religious experience.

Virginia Capers 00:24:11.841
Of course, love always is.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:14.541
And of course, that's what "Raisin" is about, Black love, the survival of Blacks in a society where we've had a difficult time surviving. And speaking of what we were talking about before Measure the Values, in terms of people who really want to get into production and investing in shows and so on, how do they really hear about these things? It's true that there are people around but -

Virginia Capers 00:24:39.322
Yes, there are several papers that are published in this city; "Show Businesses" is one, "Variety" is another, and the other paper is "Backstage." And in the back of these papers show all the potential shows that are to be brought to Broadway, who are looking for backers as well as performers. And you buy these papers, and you can read, also sometimes you happen to know someone, who know someone, and they say, "Listen, come with me. I'm going over here," and that's lots the way how it happens.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:11.510
It's kind of a mentality thinking about the roles of Blacks in a variety of ways in the Broadway theater. It really is.

Virginia Capers 00:25:18.680
Yes. And you know, and the very interesting thing in our show is that the majority of our musicians are Black. We have men who've been with Duke Ellington and Count Basie and, Oh honey, the sounds that come out of that pit are exciting.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:33.410
Ok. Talking about the sound, suppose we close out the show with the finale from the show.

Virginia Capers 00:25:37.281
Oh beautiful.

He Come Down This Morning (Reprise)" - 00:26:29.201
[Song "He Came Down This Morning (Reprise)"]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:43.181
And that was the finale of "Raisin", the hit play at the 46th street theater on Broadway, and with us tonight has been Virginia Capers star of "Raisin". I'd like to thank you, Virginia, for being with us on "Soul of Reason" tonight and telling us all about what's happening in Black theater and particularly with Raisin.

Virginia Capers 00:27:58.991
Thank you for inviting me, it's a beautiful experience.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:02.172
And it's a beautiful experience lovely life. Thank you.
