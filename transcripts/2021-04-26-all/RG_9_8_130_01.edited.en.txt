This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black box. Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:00:48.980
The Black presence in classical music has been largely ignored in the music world until now. The New York Philharmonic will help to remedy this with a celebration of music by Black composers from August 29th to September 2nd at Lincoln Center, and with us this evening on "Soul of Reason" to discuss this celebration is Dr. Leon Thompson, who is Director of Education Activities for the New York Philharmonic. And we're glad to have you with us this evening, Leon.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:01:16.491
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:18.591
Well, what about the tradition of Blacks in classical music? I understand it goes back a long way.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:01:24.371
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:24.971
(overspeak) So, as we were talking before the show, someone said that maybe even Beethoven was Black, if we use the contemporary criterion for what constitutes a Black person...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:01:34.861
Well, you know it goes back even beyond Beethoven. We have...music and...scores from composers who were Black, who wrote at the time that Mozart lived. And as a matter of fact, one of those works is going to be performed during the celebration by music...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:52.881
Now, whose music is that experience?

00:01:54.191
Nunes Garcia. He's a Black composer from Brazil, and he was the court composer during the time that he was alive, quite a prolific composer, as a matter of fact. Most of his music was vocal. He did write some instrumental music. But we have, because of the recent research, quite a bit of music that have been, that has been written by Black composers, not only in the 1700s, 1800s, 1900s, right up until the present day.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:23.091
(overspeak) That's...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:02:23.240
And the celebration that we are planning, incidentally, covers a span of 200 years...of music.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:28.471
(overspeak) Is this tied in with the bicentennial in any...?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:02:30.501
No... (laughs)

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:31.671
Just recently we had on the program two centuries of Black American art...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:02:35.891
Yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:36.381
...celebrating the...exhibit over at the Brooklyn Museum. I conducted some concerts during the bicentennial, of 200 years of music by Black composers. But this is a different motivation this time. Well, what is the motivation?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:02:49.371
Well, we have been trying to...highlight the music of Black composers for many years. When I say "we" have, I'm thinking about mainly the Black composers. Of course I am connected with the New York Philharmonic, and it is logical, I think, that they, which is the finest orchestra in this country, and the oldest orchestra, should certainly celebrate and highlight the contributions of these people who has, who have been neglected over the years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:15.890
By the way, how old is the New York Philharmonic?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:03:18.890
I think we're starting our one hundredth and thirty-...seventh, -thirty-eighth season.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:23.910
I see...and that is the oldest (overspeak, unintelligible) oldest organization...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:03:25.491
It's the oldest orchestra in this country, and second only to the Vienna Philharmonic; it's the second oldest orchestra in the world.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:32.781
That really is interesting. Given the long tradition of classical music, why is it that philharmonic orchestras have, have more recently come on the scene, if you call a hundred and thirty-nine years more recently?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:03:45.111
Given the tradition of...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:46.071
...the long tradition of classical music, why is it that organizations like the Vienna Symphony or the New York Philharmonic...really only came on the scene, this would be back in the 1840s, I guess?

00:03:57.771
Yes, well these orchestras have been, they have been continuous in their operations. There have been many, many orchestras who've started, and stopped, in...during the course of this time, but these orchestras have been continuous in their operation, and of course their contributions have been fantastic over the period of years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:14.150
Well, why is it that the classical world has sort of largely ignored...Black composers and certainly Black performers? It's only recently that people like Leontyne Price and Shirley Bidette and several others became well known in the field of opera.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:04:31.431
(overspeak) I think...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:32.804
(overspeak) Yet for a long period of time we've had people like William Grant Still, and Coleridge Taylor and Roland Hayes and people of that type who are Black and were in the classical music field. Is it the traditional racial prejudice that has kept them ignored, or is it the fact that..they just haven't been identified?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:04:50.960
Oh, they've been identified, but...here again, the music world simply reflected the social...thinking of the time, and...we can go back as far as, oh, the early nineteen hundreds when one of the first Black performers with the New York Philharmonic, incidental, was Yosay White, a Black violinist, and he...has a piece, incidentally, on this...festival, that we are going to be playing. It has been very difficult. It has been a struggle for a long time for Blacks, not only in terms of voice, but pianists, and violinists, and conductors, to find a place in the classical world. And there were singers, long before Leontyne Price, and Shirley Verrett, and Roland Hayes, and so forth, but they had to sing in their own companies, and they either had to go to Europe, and sometimes when they went there, they just did not come back. They lived over there and remained there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:46.110
Oh, wh- why did Europe accept them better than...Amer...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:05:49.501
Because because of the same social climate...it's, it's a matter of the...the climate in which we lived at that time. And I'm sure that the reason why singers go to America today, the reason why comp...(unclear) go to Europe today is because there're more opera houses there, and the people love to hear their voices, and they look at their color last. You know...the idea of the Black composer is, is a little unusual. We think about Pushkin as a Russian, but we don't, we don't call him a Black Russian, even though his, his mother was Black.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:27.001
What about Beethoven? Tell us about Beethoven...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:06:28.381
Well I could on' simply tell you that Thayer, who was Beethoven's biographer, mentioned that he was dark...and that he had a, a dark color, that kind of thing. I think under the standards that we would consider Black today, if Beethoven were alive, he would be considered Black. That's that's quite a, an argued point. Some people say he is, and some people say he isn't...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:51.971
(overspeak) And some...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:06:51.973
they say he's just a German composer, you see, and the same way with Pushkin--they say he's just a Russian writer.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:57.480
But the key point in terms of the tradition of Afro-Americans and culture and history and the like, is that...unlike the stereotype that Blacks have no culture and were not involved in the cultural mainstream...both Pushkin...and the works of Still and others shows that Blacks have always been involved in whatever mainstream...exists in whatever society they're in.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:07:20.460
(overspeak) that's true. That's true, that is very true. I mentioned Jos√© White for instance, as a violinist, who performed with the New York Philharmonic. At the time he lived in Paris, he was the darling of the Paris society, and all of this is indicated in terms of the newspaper clippings and the, the basic research that one has to go to when one, when one tries to find this information. And it's, it's amazing how they simply refer to thus and so, who's, who was an African, or who was Black, in passing, but keep saying how wonderful he was as a violinist, or how wonderful he was as a composer. They don't stress that...they don't stress his Blackness.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:55.050
What about the celebration of music by Black composers? Is this your idea, is it someone else's idea? How is it going to take place? I know there's...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:08:04.171
(overspeak) Well in...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:04.490
from August 29th to September 2nd at Avery Fisher Hall, and at the library of Lincoln Center,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:08:10.081
(overspeak) Yes..

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:10.083
...and outside, possibly in the mall... but how did this get put together? What's the purpose of it, what's your role, etc.?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:08:16.590
Well, you know, in past years, there have been, I sa...I should say the past four or five years, several symposia of music by Black composers have been held throughout the country. One in Houston with the Houston Symphony, one in Minnesota with the Minnesota Orchestra...one in Detroit with the Detroit Symphony. And...Paul Freeman was the conductor and director of those symposia. What happened was, the various composers would submit works to a committee, and several works would be selected. They would read through the works in the course of the week, and then at the end of the week they would give a concert...of the best works. Of course the New York Philharmonic is not doing a symposium; we are doing a complete festival--a week of programs: five concerts, one each night beginning on Monday August 29th, of music by Black composers, and we are highlighting some of the works that we've discovered in the earlier symposia, as well as presenting...what has not been done, a complete recital of art songs by Black composers, as well as a piano recital...by music, of music by Black composers.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:29.180
Now, is this an attempt by the Philharmonic to get a broader outreach to the Black community, or is it an attempt to educate the entire cultural community about...Black classical music?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:09:40.141
Well, I think it would encompass both. I think you know last year, the New York Philharmonic participated in what we called a festival of contemporary music, and there was one, I think Black composer listed in that group of composers who were performed during that time. This year, we are doing a complete festival...of music by Black composers, and I'm sure that...one of their reasons is that they want...the public to know...that there is some very fine music written by Black composers.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:10.980
And then of course, you may not want to comment on this, but the Philharmonic as an institution...has been frequently, as have many of our cultural institutions, been accused of ignoring Blacks...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:10:21.330
Oh, yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:21.332
there has been (unclear) ...in terms of playing in the, Philharmonic,

00:10:24.272
Yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:24.274
...being in administrative positions, and I think it's quite a credit to you...that you are able to function within an organization...as prestigious as the Philharmonic. And, and I just wonder if this isn't an attempt, in part, on the part of the Philharmonic...to gain some credibility...in the larger Black community.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:10:40.240
Well I, I certainly hope that it does. (laughs) Mostly, surely, the New York Philharmonic is interested in...certainly highlighting the very good work of, of all American composers, and they certainly do not want to...overlook the Black composers, and I can say that because I am partly responsible for the programming of the music that they play.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:03.240
And Leon Thompson in particular, has studied William Grant Still, whose "Afro- American Symphony," we're going to hear some excerpts from.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:11:14.401
Yes.

Musical Interlude 00:12:50.701
(Excerpt

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:50.702
of "Afro-American Symphony"

Musical Interlude 00:12:50.701
by

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:50.702
William Grant Still) That is really beautiful music, and you can...almost feel the pulse of Blacks as they arrived here, and worked on a plantation, and lived in New Orleans...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:13:00.411
Yes, that's...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:00.841
and so on. And I guess that's what Still was trying to tell us in that piece.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:13:04.920
(overspeak) Oh, I think so--that is definitely what I would consider indigenous music. It comes from the soil...and...we will have some music like that at the festival; there will be some music built around...the...element of jazz...on the festival; there will be some music that's built around the 20th century compositional techniques, like twelve-tone music, or avant garde music...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:30.901
(overspeak) Are you going to have some of Cecil Taylor's work?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:13:33.841
There won't be any music by Cecil Taylor...There will be some... music by...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:40.890
Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:13:41.811
Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson... There will be some music by Ulysses Kay...There will be some music by George Walker, a wonderful piano concerto he's written; a Panamanian composer, Roque Cordero, will have a violin concerto performed. We have really covered this span, of using both women composers and young composers, and established composers...a complete spectrum of music, covering really a span of 200 years...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:11.010
(overspeak) Well...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:14:11.012
...and covering the entire Black experience.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:13.170
How are you going to integrate the...the jazz? Because jazz is so much a part of the Black experience.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:14:18.401
Yes...I'm going to...one of the concerts that I'm conducting, a young cellist, Eugene Moye, will be playing David Baker's cello concerto...and David Baker was...a jazz musician before he...became...became Professor of Composition at Indiana University. He...has written a very fine composition, and this young cellist is going to play it...for us at the final concert. This composition is built around the element of jazz.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:49.530
Now, for people in the audience who want to learn more about this concert, is there a phone number they could call or...is there a ticket office they can contact?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:15:00.270
Yes, indeed. We have a very wonderful...ticket situation, I think, involving the festival. They should call five eight oh...eight seven hundred, which is the New York Philharmonic number, five eight oh...eight seven hundred. The tickets are at popular prices: 3, 4, and 5 dollars, and if you buy the entire series, you can get three concerts for the price of two...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:27.271
And basically this puts it within the range of the average citizen.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:15:30.210
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:31.301
(overspeak, unclear) So (you keep the...) that you want to deal with

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:15:32.471
Very much so.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:33.351
(overspeak) And then..

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:15:33.353
And we also have two free concerts that will take place at the Lincoln Center Library. The first one, the opening concert, is there on Monday evening; on Tuesday evening, the choral concert using the Morgan State University Chorus doing the mass by Nunes Garcia from Brazil, is on Tuesday in Avery Fisher Hall. Wednesday evening, the piano recital is free at the Library, and the other two concerts on Thursday and Friday are in Fisher Hall.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:00.930
What time will the evening concerts be?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:16:03.571
Each of the concert starts at eight-thirty.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:05.521
Eight-thirty. That's at the Library at Lincoln Center.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:16:07.680
Library, and at the...Avery Fisher Hall.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:10.861
I see. So I think it's important for those in the audience who are interested to call...the Philharmonic, area code two one two, five eight oh, eight seven hundred, for information...about the celebration of music by Black composers. Another Black composer who's done some very interesting work is Ulysses Simpson Kay, who in celebration of...Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's memorial, composed a piece, "Markings,"

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:16:40.791
Yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:40.981
...which relates to Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's...writings. So we will now hear some of Ulysses Kay's "Markings."

musical Interlude 00:16:47.192
(Excerpt of "Markings" by Ulysses Kay)

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:06.830
Now, that was Ulysses Kay's "Markings," which I understand...was written as a tribute to Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, and really...takes its name from Hammarskj√∂ld's writings,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:19:18.050
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:18.471
...called "Markings."

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:19:19.401
You know...Mr. Kay is distinguished professor of music at Lehman College, here in New York City...and it's interesting to note the wide...difference in the music that Mr. Kay is writing...and the music that William Grant Still wrote.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:33.411
Why is that?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:19:34.101
Well, they lived at different times. I think they were, they are reacting to the...the...motivation of their times and, as well as, their own interests You know, William Grant Still started out...experimenting with new sounds, and finally decided that he wanted to...concentrate his writings on the ethnic aspect of his race. Another composer, for instance, Mr. Kay, has not made the decision to, to simply concentrate his writing on the ethnic aspect of his, of his race. He is interested in writing good music. And in the final analysis, this is what's counts.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:10.040
But see, this raises the question that...is almost always raised when you pick out Black literature, Black art, Black dance, Black classical music... everything, possibly with the exception of jazz, as to why...you choose to pull together...a program, or a book, or an exhibit, or a concert...that focuses just on Black composers...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:20:35.811
in this case...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:36.610
(overspeak) Why, why do you do that?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:20:37.520
In this case, the Black composers show such a wide variety of, of, of styles...that the entire festival is going to be really quite exciting--very, very exciting, with something in it for everybody. But I think our main interest, in this case is the fact that...Black composers have not had this kind of forum. You know, at the kind, at the time ...the celebration is taking place, there will be a hundred and seventy music critics here from all over the United States. This is taking place at the same time that the National Music Critics Association is having its annual meeting. Black singers, Black instrumentalists, Black composers, Black artists...can never get a better forum...than to perform for the...entire Music Critics Association in this country.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:28.070
Of course, you're really saying that not only is this an artistic presentation, but it's also a political statement. It's a statement about a signif...significant segment of people in our society who have been excluded from the mainstream, in a sense, this is one opportunity to bring them into the mainstream.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:21:44.060
This is a showcase, showing composers and, and performers...of all, you know, of...of the Black race, and it is showing them...at a time when they can be...highlighted, (overspeak) concentrated...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:56.970
(overspeak) Well, how do you...how do you answer the criticism of some critics, most...mostly white, who say, why should we look at Black art, or why should we look at Black music? We don't look at Jewish music, but we don't look at Irish music...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:22:08.961
(overspeak) But they do, but they do...

00:22:09.501
And of course, the point is that... (overspeak) They don't...they don't call it that, but they do. Whenever a conductor from Italy comes to the New York Philharmonic, he always brings an Italian composer; he just happens to be white. But, (laughs) but if, if...if there's a Polish conductor coming to conduct the New York Philharmonic, you can bet your life there's a Polish composer on that program. And my reaction is, I'm a Black conductor; why can't I conduct the music of Black composers?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:33.650
And of course, that doesn't exclude you from conducting the music of other composers...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:22:36.811
(overspeak) No, Beethoven, Mozart, anybody else,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:36.815
sure... (overspeak, unclear) that you do... That's exactly right. Well, what about the...general interest of the Black community, particularly Black youth and classical music? I know many years ago, going out of schools like the Howard University Conservatory of Music, and...in Atlanta University, and some of the...major...centers, such as at Fisk, in Tennessee, there were...Blacks being trained, and educated in classical music, a long tradition in classical music. I remember as a kid sitting through endless number of concerts,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:11.962
(overspeak) Right, yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:12.171
one of which had both George Walker and Frances Walker,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:15.530
Oh, yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:15.981
(overspeak) they went to a high school in Washington D.C....playing, and they were geniuses at that time...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:21.501
(overspeak) Incidentally, George Walk...one of George Walker's pieces is on this program...(laughs)

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:24.710
(overspeak) That's, that's...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:24.891
marvelous composer.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:26.451
(overspeak) And they were

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:26.751
(overspeak) Well,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:26.753
geniuses at that time,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:27.811
Sure,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:27.813
but now...with

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:30.471
(overspeak) They're still coming along...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:30.560
the popularity of jazz, and the fact that so many of your creative Black musicians, people like...Herbie Hancock

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:38.231
Right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:38.811
Stevie Wonder, and people of that type...have had classical training, but then transferred over into the jazz medium.They did, because...Now why, why is it that there are not many Blacks, as many, in the classical music today, and what can we do to get more into it?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:23:54.201
Well, there...there isn't any one-two-three question-answer type situation...as an answer to that question. I, I wish I had the time to go into detail, but I can say, number one, Hubert Laws and persons like that, who have marvelous classical background and who have, are first rate artists, sometimes go into the jazz area...because it's economically more feasible for them to do so. I hasten to add, however, that if the doors were open for Hubert Laws to get into a symphony orchestra earlier, I think he would have taken that...regardless of the fact that he might have made more money in jazz music.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:33.641
Because that puts an exclamation point behind the purpose of this celebration

00:24:36.461
(overspeak) Sure, of music of Black composers, (overspeak) Sure... to, as you said earlier, to help to bring them into the mainstream.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:24:41.691
Yes. And the other thing is, that...Howard University, and..and other schools of that type, you know Black colleges, are still turning out very fine Black performers. Unfortunately, the...the instrumentalist does not have the same entr√©e as the singers do. Black violinists, and Black cellists, black pianists, have a little bit more difficult time making it. It's not easy for anybody...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:05.561
Not easy for any cellist...(overspeak) That's right... And even... in the, in terms of Blacks, the Black female singer...will get a better chance at performing than the Black violinist...That's still the, a, a result of this social structure and, and the whole political...way of thinking about Blacks, and what they're capable of doing.(overspeak) But isn't music colorblind?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:25:28.830
(inhales) Well, one says that, but...(laughs) the music itself is; but those who handle it aren't always colorblind. (laughs)In other words, what we are aware of, in all ranges of the arts, is that there is a social factor... in in, in every aspect of...(overspeak) So (overspeak) Yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:43.851
(overspeak) in terms of the critics, in terms of the managers, In terms of the people who make...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:25:46.200
(overspeak) In every aspect of our lives; we must realize this. There is no panacea, there is no...open way, an easy way for anybody. Americans in general have it more difficult in this country in classical music than, than foreigners...because of a very, very long tradition of everything coming from Europe that was good--that teachers were from Europe, the languages...the German, French, and Italian, and so forth. So we're still battling that. One doesn't think that an American composer should be as great as they say, let's say a German composer, for instance.

00:26:19.251
Oh, we have the same... (overspeak) We have to battle at that. We have to fight that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:22.510
We really have the same thing, I was about to say, even in sports, in...soccer, for example, which is a European import,

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:26:28.090

originally...American soccer players have a more difficult time...and then when you go beyond that, Black Americans have an even more difficult time.

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:26:36.700
Sure

00:26:36.702
Which says...

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:26:37.440
(overspeak) There are, there are individuals who stand out...you know there're always the one, the two, or three who are, who are stars...but...for the general person that, who is very talented, who can, who can perform very well, he may find it a little bit more difficult...here...than if he goes to another country, for instance.

What about Black organizations like The Symphony of the New World? How are they doing?

Dr. Leon Thompson 00:26:57.970
It's a marvelous organization, and let me take this opportunity to say to all persons, listeners, that this is an organization that deserves the support...of all persons. It is the only organization of its kind...you know, in the country, and it is an absolute first-rate, professional orchestra. We need all the support that we can get...and...make no doubt about it, were not for The Symphony of the New World, Black composers, Black conductors, Black performers would not have a forum.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:31.060

(overspeak) (unclear) an excellent statement, because that does reflect the struggle that Blacks have gone through, and are still going through, to gain entr√©e into this area of classical music, this area of culture which has largely been excluded, because of the racism, it permeates the society. And one of the things we try to point up on "Soul of Reason" is that...the movement of Blacks toward first class...citizenship, totally...involves every particular facet of our society. And that's particularly true with classical music, and art, literature, every particular area. Again, those in the audience who are interested in getting information about the celebration of music by Black composers should contact the New York Philharmonic at Area Code two one two, five eight oh, eight seven hundred. Our guest tonight on "Soul of Reason" has been Dr. Leon Thompson, who is Director of Education Activities at the New York Philharmonic, and...we've been talking about this really fantastic celebration of Black classical music that will be held at the Philharmonic. Thank you. It's going to be very exciting...you shouldn't really miss it.
