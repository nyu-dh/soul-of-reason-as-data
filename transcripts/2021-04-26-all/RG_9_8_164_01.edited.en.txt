Over the past two years the budget of the New York City Board of Education has been cut approximately 150 million dollars, which translates into approximately 14,000 teachers and 12,000 paraprofessionals guidance counselors and other personnel. Hear Dr. Arnold Webb Executive Director of the Division of Educational Planning and Support discuss the effects of the budget cuts on the New York City Board of Education on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:47.411
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:15.190
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Dr. Arnold Webb, who's with the New York City Board of Education as Director of the Division of Educational Planning and Support, which translates into curriculum and all the things that really happen in school. So glad to have you with us tonight, Arnold.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:01:31.031
Nice to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:32.681
This, these are tough times for you because the schools are just opening, and we have this budget crunch it's affected all of New York City, and many people--and I know you feel this way--feel that the New York City Board of Education has been cut even more than the other city agencies. So maybe you could tell our audience about some of these cuts and then we'll discuss the effects of these cuts.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:01:56.230
Okay fine. Last year for the 1975-1976 school year, the tax levy budget for the Board of Education was cut in excess of one hundred million dollars. Approximately a hundred, little over one hundred million dollars this year. The budget has been cut a total of fifty million dollars. Now that fifty million dollars includes about 38 million dollars in tax levy funding, a little over ten million dollars in capital funded items, and several million dollars out of our special education and mental health programs which support education in New York City. This cut, the second cut that we've had, represents the second stage of a three stage process for cutting back on the expenditure picture in New York City for the all of the city agencies. However those of us in education feel that the cuts have been disproportionately applied to the educational system. And that's the thing we've been fighting against, in terms of the Stavisky bill.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:04.841
Now for the audience's edification maybe we could discuss the Stavisky bill for a moment. That's a bill that was initiated in the state legislature by Assemblyman Leonard Stavisky of Queens. And the purpose of it was to keep the percentage of the total budget of New York City that the Board of Education was receiving in the past at the same level and I think that percentage was somewhere around 20 or 21 percent.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:03:30.101
Yes. And the, the point of the Stavisky bill was not that education felt that it should not receive cuts in these trying times for New York City, but rather that the cuts should be applied on a proportionate basis rather than disproportionately. If education represents somewhere, a little over 20 percent of the city budget then education should receive its cuts in that proportion. Rather than that it received cuts of, oh way-- well above 30 percent.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:06.880
Now what finally happened is that the governor vetoed the bill and the state legislature passed the bill over his veto back last spring, and then--

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:04:17.101
For the first time in one hundred and four years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:18.671
That is really the first time.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:04:20.951.0000000000291
Yeah, yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:20.952.9999999999709
And then the--I believe it's called the Supreme Court of the state--ruled that the Stavisky bill was unconstitutional. And I understand now that the Board of Education is appealing the bill.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:04:33.320
The Board is appealing it and the President of the Board Dr. Christen Dr. Robert Christen has already initiated appeal procedures.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:44.823
Now, however, as the budget is being planned now the cuts are in effect. You, the city budget has not restored the cuts that were mandated by the Stavisky bill.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:04:58.881
No.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:59.141
Those cuts are still in effect.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:05:00.401
Cuts are in effect and 35 hundred teachers have received layoff notices effective September 1st.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:07.390
Now of course that has very striking personal effects of course but also it has effects in terms of the effectiveness of the system. It was alleged at least that the total enrollment in the New York City schools had gone down to such an extent that they didn't need as many teachers. But I believe that the latest statistics show that enrollment is just about level the way it was about four or five years ago.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:05:28.191
The the enrollment decline has pretty well leveled off. Yes we did have declines averaging about, oh 12 to 15,000 pupils a year for about five or six years, but that's stopped now and we've leveled off. And when you look at a decline of 12,000 children, and you compare that to the million one hundred thousand children that we have in the system, you can see that even that kind of enrollment decline is not significant in terms of being able to cut back on services.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:00.101
That certainly doesn't translate even with the average of 30 pupils a classroom into 14,000 teachers.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:06:05.771
No way.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:06.422
Would suggest that some, someone, some agency, some group of individuals are saying to the people of New York City that a classroom average size of 30 or 32 is really too small and you're going to go up to 38 or 40 and in some instances 45, and one of the real questions is whether the citizens of New York City can stand this type of assault on its educational program. What are some of the things that you folks on the Board of Education are doing to adjust to this dramatic cutback, and also what are some things you're doing other than the court appeal to try to get some of this money back?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:06:47.020
Okay first of all what we are doing is trying to make sure that those resources which remain to us are being effectively utilized. Toward that end for example for the first time the Central Board of Education and all of the top level executives went through what was called a priority budgeting review process last spring when we were planning the budget for this school year. And that involved every administrator of a major program at the board reviewing his program, justifying his program, doing a zero based review in terms of effective aspects of his program, those that were not effective, and presenting an organized and detailed plan to the Central Board in terms of how he would apply cuts. What were those items, those activities, those programs that were deemed as absolutely essential, as opposed to programs that although meaningful and helpful were not essential to continue maintaining that kind of a project. Now this process I think was very very helpful not only to those of us who engaged in it but to the Board in terms of understanding the complete process. The Board then had the, the job of listening to all of these presentations asking questions and then making determinations as to how the cuts were to be applied to each one of the programs within the board. Now that's one of the things that has been going on.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:22.870
[makes sound]

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:08:22.872
The budget itself is being recast in terms of this kind of priority budgeting process.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:29.810
Now which means that things of the highest priority are the last things cut, things of the lowest priority are cut first. Which then asks me, it leads me to ask how can the Board of Education justify cutting the already limited guidance services as much as they've cut them? I know that's a hard question but it's one that all of us who are educators and parents want to ask.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:08:55.182
You know it kind of comes down to you know which do you need more your, your your arms or your legs? The Board is really very very much concerned and disturbed by the cutback in guidance services, but there are a couple of things that impact on that. First of all we are in a decentralized school system for elementary and junior high schools, so that within each of our 32 decentralized districts the local the community school board and the professional staff of the community district have the option of determining how they are going to use the resources that they receive. If they feel that their priorities involve things other than maintaining guidance counselors at full strength then they have the option to do that. That kind of determination was made in many of the school districts. It meant that school districts in many cases felt that the top priority that they had was maintaining classroom instruction. To the extent that it was possible to do given the resources they would keep supportive services such as guidance services. But in many cases this was really not possible to do and maintain a reasonable class size.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:15.640
Now of course that leads you to a sort of a Hobson's choice, that either way you go--

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:10:19.891
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:19.893
you're going to lose, and it goes back to the question as to whether the original budget for the New York City schools was adequate. So if you assume that, the, we didn't have enough guidance counselors in the first place and now the effect that the fiscal crisis is to cut back on the guidance counselors even more, it sort of exacerbates or makes worse, a, a problem that we initially had, and as a, an administrator, one who's responsible for planning and curriculum development and the like, I really sometimes wonder how you go about helping to repair some of this damage--some damage possibly can't be repaired--but, are there some things that you're doing through your division that the schools are doing to try to repair this damage, or is most of the energy going as you might expect into the political and administrative energy that it takes to get the money back?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:11:15.101
Well to answer the last part of your question first, yes there is a good deal of energy going into trying to get back some of the financial support that we need, not only through the, the appeals process in terms of the Stavisky bill and incidentally I think it is important to mention that the Board, the Central Board had committed itself, if we had received the funds from the Stavisky board the Stavisky law to funnel and channel all of those funds every penny of them into the schools. None of those were to be used for any headquarters administrative functions or any functions outside of direct assistance to schools and to, to districts. In addition, we are also looking very very carefully into the areas of additional sources of funding outside of the regular tax levy sources not only from federal and state sources but also from foundations and special grants. And although we have for years been receiving additional support, right now that support is more important to us than ever and we are seeking every available avenue for getting additional funds. We also have been working on setting up a number of special programs that will help to try to fill the gap that's been created by the by the loss of teachers and by the cutback in support services. We have increased our staff development in our training programs so that we are working closely with teachers and just as importantly with administrators in terms of what needs to be done and what kind of support can be given to schools and districts. We have a network of schools called a beacon light network where we have over one hundred schools where principals sit down and talk with each other and discuss their common problems and approaches to common problems and kind of gain strength one from the other through these kinds of discussions. And we've also set up programs of inter-visitation where superintendents visit each other and where we are having many many discussions on the best way to approach the crisis and to use our resources more effectively than we are using them.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:36.781
To what extent is business involved in helping you with this?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:13:42.030
The business and, you mean the business community?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:46.621
Yes.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:13:47.041
Yes. I'm glad you mentioned that because we have been doing quite a bit with working with the working with the business community. We have contacted many of the banks for example who are working with us and other foundations.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:59.550
We are talking this evening with Dr. Arnold Webb who is Executive Director of the Division of Planning and Support of the New York City school system. And as we were saying before Arnold, it is important for the business community to help the schools. And as you said you have contacted some of the businesses and some of the foundations. Do you think that one of the pluses of this experience if you can call it a plus, is that the experience will help to make the business community more aware of the needs of the school system and also more aware of their responsibilities to the schools?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:14:36.480
I think it will most decidedly make them more aware of their responsibilities to the schools and it will also make those of us in the schools, and in the administration of the schools, more aware of the fact that we do have a resource out there and that it is incumbent upon us to go to these resources and to help them to spell out how that need can be translated into action. And I think that we have had really very very fine responses from a number of major corporations within the city and outside of the city who are interested in doing what they can to help education not just now in its hour of need but to set up an ongoing kind of rela--supportive relationship. And that is taking place now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:27.321
[crosstalk] Go ahead.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:15:28.081
I think it ties in too to another thrust that we have this year, and that we have had but that we're building upon and developing and that is, developing our career and occupational education thrust of our educational services in New York City. And given the problem that we face in terms of the severe dropout rates. The problem that Vernon Jordan referred to at the Urban League Conference up in Boston where he cited a figure of up to 64 percent of our, of Black youth who are unemployed and looking for jobs and rudderless and without really without the kind of hope that they need and the opportunity that they need. That's a responsibility that we in the schools have it's a responsibility that industry has it's a responsibility that all of our citizens have and we are working toward developing the career and occupational education thrust that we have by tying in directly with the large corporations, by setting up these ongoing relationships by taking children to these companies by having the companies come to the schools and visit and work and support financially and support actively.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:44.720
Now one feeling that some people have is that the official school systems not only in New York but in other places, have tended to be insular have tended to resist suggestions from citizens' groups from businesses from other professions. And now in its hour of crisis, in many of the community people do not really understand why the schools need money for what they need money for, and also in a sense the schools are not as responsive as they should be to the very significant employment and career crisis that faces particularly inner city youth. So again I'm going to ask you, what are you doing at New York City Board of Education to reach out? What are some of your innovative programs? Cause I know you have some. And as I've said before there are people like yourself who understand the need to reach out. And of course you have to sort of swim against the tide of doing things the way we've always done them. So let's talk about innovative programs in New York City Board of Education.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:17:51.590
Okay I'll be happy to. And just before I do that let me mention that we are really very much aware of the need and the interdependence that we have with the community, and we have a number of ways by which we do reach the community and work with them on an ongoing basis. For example we have advisory councils of every conceivable sort in every curriculum area. We have advisory councils that review every outside funding source that that we have and that we receive so that we do meet with people on an ongoing basis. We have a number of programs of which we are very proud. The chancellor for Irving Anchor for example has on a number of occasions cited the fact that the Westinghouse award winners, of the 40 winners on a nationwide basis that eleven were from New York City and he's he's very proud of what we do in the area of science but we do a lot of other things too. We have a number of innovative programs going on in in, in early childhood. We have what we call open enrollment support centers where we have had children going to schools outside of their area and being given special assistance and special help and working in terms of evaluation of how the additional support that they have can be translated into achievement. We are very proud of the fact that we're setting up a new center for reading in New York City and this is the very first time that we have addressed the reading problem in this manner where we're going to have a group of people whose only responsibility will be working in improving reading skills of pupils all over the city and doing research in terms of reading--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:47.710
Now is that related to the Right to Read program, it's the overall federal program or is something that's a special state or city program?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:19:55.121
This will be working with the, some of the personnel from the Right to Read program. But what we've done in the past in attacking the reading problem is we have attacked it kind of tangentially with special programs here and special programs there. But we never had an ongoing center, or a unit specifically designed to work on the reading problem. Not only will the Right to Read program be involved but Reading is Fundamental program, which we are most proud of now but that will also be involved in our center. And the Reading is Fundamental program it's a program that is operative in, about oh about 26 or 27 districts where we obtain books for the children and give them an opportunity to read them and do some follow up and it involves not only recreational reading but it involves reading for a purpose. We have received some federal support for it. We are looking for more. And we're very proud of that. But all of this will be coordinated under one center and we hope that this will, will really yield some some benefits, for the reading problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:58.570
I think it's important as you mentioned that coordination in the one center, I think it is important when talking about reading is for the audience to recognize that you're not talking about everybody being taught to read the same way using the same books at the same time, because one of the things that's true in reading instruction is that people learn different ways. And there are dozens of different ways in which people can learn to read. I believe you're just talking about getting an organization a control an understanding of what's going on so that, in a system as large as New York City with a million pupils, that some places aren't doing terrifically well and some others doing very very poorly because they're being ignored.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:21:41.920
No you're quite right Roscoe there, there is no one way to teach reading and anybody who thinks that there is that one way will apply to everyone is is is kidding himself. There are a number of techniques that have been tried some of which have been very successful others less than successful. Our job is to find out what has worked, why it has worked, to try it out, to evaluate it, and to use it where it can be, where it can be used effectively. So that that is most most definitely the kind of approach that, that we are taking. And we're also taking the approach that there are a number of reading skills. We're not just talking about the, teaching children how to read or how to recognize words or how to translate symbols. That's a part of it sure. But we're also talking about developmental reading skills we're talking about drawing inferences and we're talking about being able to use research materials and we're talking generally about working on attacking the entire area of reading. Incidentally we are working with the colleges and universities in the in the city including NYU in terms of trying to set up some special projects for the reading center to work and and to obtain some additional funding.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:02.801
Now that's one of the things that is important and we've talked about the fiscal crisis. Many of the things that are being cut out are things that could possibly be funded from sources other than public moneys. As we said from businesses from foundations from governmental grants at the state and the federal level, and I guess one of your jobs is to try to do this. But one thing that always amazes me when you look at New York City schools--I think you have some 700 elementary schools and a couple of hundred high schools--is how can you be sure, how can the taxpayer be sure that he's getting his money's worth in terms of what's being invested in education in this two point seven billion dollar budget? How can we really be sure that we are getting every dollar's worth of service to children? We talk about cutting back on teachers and we talk about ratios but when you get beyond you know so many children per class etc., how can the taxpayer know that he is getting an appropriate and a proper education for his child based on what's going into the budget of New York City Board of Education? I know that's a tough question it's one that everybody grapples with, but I think it's one that we need to respond to.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:24:22.730
Well I think that first of all, in the decentralized system under which we're functioning, for elementary and junior high schools, there is a mechanism that has been set up that has been functioning we're into the seventh year of decentralization. There are nine member community school boards in each of 32 districts that make the educational policy for the district, that conduct public meetings, by law must conduct public meetings on a regular basis to report to the community and what is going on in the schools within the district. And public meetings are not restricted to parents only, any member of the community can be a part of it. Any member of the community can ask questions and can take part in the process. And I think that it is absolutely essential that the the citizenry hold the educational system accountable. I mentioned before that we do have advisory committees. In the high schools there are parent federations, set up in each of the boroughs where they do meet regularly with those people who are the principals and who are the superintendents of the high schools. They meet regularly, the chancellor has a special advisory commission. Every letter that comes in from a citizen to the chancellor is answered. If it's not answered directly by the chancellor it's answered by the person whom the chancellor feels can be most responsive to the questions asked in the letter, so that it's a two way street. We welcome the the participation, in fact we need it, and we need to be monitored and we need to be questioned and we need to be held accountable by the citizens but by the same token, the people have to use the kinds of procedures and mechanisms that have been set up and take advantage of them.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:11.260
Of course I hear you say loud and clearly that those of us who complain about the educational establishment have a responsibility to be on the firing line asking those questions demanding more of those school systems the, all those school districts in which our children go to school. One of the problems about decentralization is that, in some instances it has been alleged that a small vested interest group gets in control of the board and gets in control of the board meetings and some of them even end up in physical confrontations, and as a result the so-called more responsible citizens stay away. My own personal opinion is that, responsible citizens can't afford to stay away when something gets tough that's the time that they really need to be there. But in your opinion how do you feel the decentralization is working overall recognizing that there have been some specific problems?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:27:06.171
With all of the problems of decentralization and I won't attempt to minimize them, I think that decentralization is the salvation of our school system. I think that we have had made enormous gains under decentralization. I think we're going to make even more gains. Keep in mind we have 32 districts in some districts we may have more problems than in other districts. But even in those districts I think we are moving in the only direction that we can move. And--if I have time there's just one other thing that I'd like to mention that's very key to this--that for the very first time, I think in this fight this spring for the Stavisky bill and for more resources for education we had a coming together of all of the forces the community forces the board the unions all joining together recognizing the need for educational resources.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:59.640
And that shows that sometimes out of adversity you can get some progress. Unfortunately we are taking two steps backward to go three steps forward, but it does reflect the fact that many groups in New York City are aware of the impact of the fiscal crisis on the schools and want to do something about it. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Dr. Arnold Webb who is Executive Director of the Division of Educational Planning and Support of the New York City Board of Education. And we've been talking about the impact of the fiscal crisis on the New York City schools and ways in which the leadership of the Board of Education, the business community, and other private groups are working to minimize the impact of these cuts. Thanks again for being our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason," Arnold.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:28:46.931
My pleasure, Roscoe.
