This is the soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black thought soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University. The struggle for majority rule in Southern Africa is the most potentially explosive powder keg in the world. Tonight on sole of reason we'll be talking with Franklin Williams who is president of the Phelps Stokes Fund and former United States ambassador to Ghana. And Frank we're glad to have you with us this evening.

Franklin Williams 00:01:06.291
Well I'm glad to be here with you Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:01:09.251
Well, you've just arrived back in the country from a trip to Africa. I don't know whether you went to Southern Africa this time or not but when you were over on the African continent what did you find in terms of the vibrations or the feelings of the African peoples regarding the situation in southern Africa.

Franklin Williams 00:01:27.830
Well I've been in Africa twice in the last three months Roscoe. In April I went to the frontline states including Rhodesia and my most recent trip I went to some East African and West African States incidentally I had the privilege of having dinner with the President Kaunda of Zambia as well as meeting and talking with the president of Botswana Seretse Khama. I also had a lengthy conversation with the foreign minister of Tanzania and Kenya. Southern Africa is number one on everyone's agenda whether the states are in North Africa East Africa West Africa or the frontline states. There is some feeling that the United States under this administration has taken one or (and) two steps beyond the initiatives that Secretary Kissinger had started but there also is a great deal of cynicism about whether the United States will vigorously push its so-called new initiatives. The point is constantly made and I think properly so that the depth and extent of American investment in South Africa as well as America's continuing preoccupation with the threat of the spread of communism will get in the way of our good judgment and prevent us from bringing the kinds of pressures on South Africa that in most African leaders opinion as well as in my opinion will be necessary to move that nation really to extend a true opportunity in South West Africa as well as in Zimbabwe for majority rule.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:03:17.340
Well you've written a recent editorial editorial piece which appeared in Newsday which I saw in which you specified a number of very specific things that could be done in relationship to the United States economic involvement in Zimbabwe Namibia and in South Africa itself. And as I read those including boycotts and things of this type and refrain from investment I wondered if it is really realistic at this point in time for the United States government to be able to impose those type of controls on economic investment in southern Africa.

Franklin Williams 00:03:59.770
Well it is if we if we wanted to. Let me let me make a couple of points if I may Roscoe South Africa has nothing to gain in my judgment by voluntarily undermining Ian Smith in Rhodesia or Zimbabwe or by voluntarily giving up its economic and political control of South West Africa and it is naive for American leaders whether it be the president vice president or Ambassador Young or Secretary Vance to suggest to us the American people that somehow or other South Africa out of the goodness of their heart are going to cut their own throats or cut off their nose to spite their face by having world attention zeroed in on Rhodesia and on South West Africa. That sort of insulates South Africa itself from world attention. And the longer we debate the techniques or the approaches to majority rule in those two territories the longer South Africa has to try to resolve its own internal problems by implementing the philosophy of separate development the Bantustans which it as pronounced as its technique for resolving its racial problems so that in my judgment all of the talk that we have been hearing from this administration and the prior administration about cooperation from South Africa frightens me. We don't know what our leaders are pledging or promising South Africa in return for cooperation. I can't for the life of me see why they would undercut Smith or surrender South West Africa without getting a quid pro quo without getting something in return. And what could we possibly give them in return except to say to them that we will not press them on apartheid or that we will not oppress them, we will not press them on the whole process of separate development which they have propounded. So my concern is that if we are to make progress we're going to have to take some tough and direct action against South Africa. And there are a large number of things that we could do Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:06:09.080
I know based on some conversations we'd had last year I believe at the time the Kissinger initiatives. There was a projection that if there had not been some type of third party interference the guerrilla movement probably would have overthrown the government in Rhodesia at that time--

Franklin Williams 00:06:28.472
That's Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:06:29.670
--and there was a fear right for not that there might be mass slaughters of whites. And one of the things that allegedly was happening was that out of the goodness of their heart quote unquote the South Africans were interceding to try to get the Rhodesians to negotiate so that this wouldn't happen. I am not that close to the situation I really can evaluate that. But many people I've talked with have been very suspicious of the United States South African initiatives in regard to Rhodesia. What is the situation now. Is the guerrilla movement strong enough in Rhodesia to really overthrow the government if they want to or are they really more or less stalemated?

Franklin Williams 00:07:15.960
No not now in my judgment. They are not now presently strong enough to overthrow the Rhodesian government. The Rhodesian army is a fantastically well-trained and powerful and well equipped and well-disciplined army. The guerrillas operating out of Mozambique and more recently out of Zambia are increasingly strong and trained. But in my judgment it will take quite some time before they'll be able to overthrow the Rhodesian military the see-- the secret to it Rosco in South Africa. There's no point in talking about Rhodesia or South West Africa Rhodesia could not survive 24 hours if (in) South Africa cut off its oil supplies. South Africa is funneling directly from its ports through its pipelines through its various sources, petroleum products that are necessary to reduce this war machine and continues to do so as a matter of fact perhaps even to their own detriment because in South Africa proper the gasoline stations close on Friday night and open up on Monday. But in Rhodesia, the gasoline stations are open 24 hours a day seven days a week. Rhodesia is not really going to be an easy target for the guerrillas without a tremendous expenditure of manpower and money over many many months to come unless we can bring the kind of pressure on South Africa that will be necessary to have a cut off its oil supplies. I understand for example that a number of international petroleum companies perhaps even one American company have been guilty of a conspiracy to divert petroleum products that were supposed to have been delivered to Zambia and to supply them to Rhodesia. And that's the key. And we have got to develop if we if we are sincere in what we say about Rhodesia. We have got to develop techniques for forcing South Africa to cut off oil supplies to Rhodesian if they don't do it then we've got to come up with some punitive measures and we can't continue to just pray and hope we've got to do something.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:09:26.960
Alright, what would some of those measures be and what (where) do you think the probabilities are of getting those instituted.

Franklin Williams 00:09:31.350
Well the whole series of measures and I think it would be a mistake for anyone to advocate measures which would have no immediate political hope of being enacted. But we could communicate to South Africa in a variety of ways the sincerity of our purpose we could for example start by denying tax credits to those businesses in South West Africa which are paying taxes to South Africa. We could lower the level of our representation in South Africa the kind of thing that we have done in other countries to show our displeasure that could take a number of forms ranging all the way from recalling our ambassador or when his term runs out simply not replacing him we don't have to make a big point of it in diplomatic circles people get the message. We could begin to pressure South Africa in an area that I think we should have been moving on long ago. As with communist countries when they limit the travel of our diplomats we limit the travel of their diplomats when they refuse admission or refuse a visa to an American intellectual. If we refuse a visa to a communist intellectual but we don't do that with South Africa South Africa refuses visas to Americans regularly and we don't do likewise we should indicate that if, if they're going to continue to deny a legitimate American citizens access to South Africa we're going to deny a legitimate South African citizens access to this country. We could We could prohibit additional new investment in South Africa. That's a real possibility. We could in (end) the United Nations call for a, a and participate with the Third World and a more severe condemnation of South Africa. After all in years past we have not we have not joined that coterie of countries that have labeled South Africa for what it is. We should seek and we should take a seat on the UN Committee for Namibia a committee set up to take jurisdiction over that territory. We refuse to take a seat when it was founded. We claim that we're committed to independence for Namibia. Why don't we take a seat on the U.N. Commission on Namibia. Now there are a whole series of things of that kind that we could do. We could extend recognition to Angola which would demonstrate to South Africa our displeasure of their intransigence. We could participate with other countries and in prohibiting or in boycotting South Africa from legitimate international competitive arenas including our own very highly worthwhile international competition whether it be tennis or golf or what have you. On the theory that blacks and others are not given an equal opportunity to develop and to participate and to compete for these prizes coming out of South Africa. That's just a few of the things--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:12:41.461
Well, those all seem to be--

Franklin Williams 00:12:43.501
And I think my point is these are things within reason these are not things that we couldn't get done.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:12:49.580
Well they do seem to be attainable if not totally dramatic steps. On the other hand they haven't been initiated in the past other than some good words coming from Andy Young at the United Nations. There hasn't been really a great deal of change in the United States policy towards southern Africa. Young has gotten a lot of brickbats because some of the things he said about racism throughout the world. But even in his case is the specific positions at the United Nations mission has been able to take have not been particularly forthright or direct.

Franklin Williams 00:13:27.211
They certainly have been very vigorous when it comes to South Africa. That's for sure. For example look at the the preeminence that this administration has has given to its concern for human rights in the USSR a handful of intellectuals being oppressed being denied the opportunity to emigrate. And we, and I think properly so, are willing even to risk the salt talks to demonstrate the depth of our feeling and commitment to human rights. We've had hardly a peep out of the White House on the state and condition of human rights in South Africa recently when one of the most distinguished black women of that country Mrs. Mandela who was guilty of only God knows what violation of expression of opinion and whose husband as you know is in prison. She was moved out of her home one night to an isolated village put in a house without electricity or running water or inside plumbing facilities. This highly educated wife of a former leader of the African National Congress has been treated in a way that I would have hoped and expected President Carter would have spoken out at a press conference very vigorously and very directly in condemnation of South Africa and indicated as he does with the USSR America's displeasure. But we haven't done so. I can't help but wonder why, I think I know but I'll reserve my judgment.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:15:07.052
Tonight on soul of reason we are talking with Franklin Williams president of the Phelps Stokes Fund and former United States ambassador to Ghana. We're talking about the very explosive situation in southern Africa. And Frank you just said you have an idea as to why this has not been done in terms of responding to the oppression of human rights in southern Africa I have an idea too. I think that basically in the United States as a predominately white country we really are not as concerned about the rights of nonwhites in this instance blacks and whereas Carter himself President Carter has established some initiative to improve conditions for black Americans. I think that basic is a very threatening political posture more than any white person to other--

Franklin Williams 00:15:56.771
What initiatives has he taken?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:15:59.091
Well, I've anticipated you would raise some questions among (in) those lines--

Franklin Williams 00:16:03.101
I haven't seen very many.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:16:03.108
I one initiative I think we can agree he's (is) taken he has appointed more blacks in various administrative positions--

Franklin Williams 00:16:11.171
That's fine and that should be applauded and I do applaud it we've got more black ambassadors we've got more distinguished appointees but that's not helping the great masses. He's also been preoccupied with a balanced budget to the point where our social programs have been very vigorously curtailed in AGW we've seen program after program which was designed to benefit minorities cut back. Frankly Roscoe I am unimpressed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:16:35.710
We've had other political spokesmen, and I call you political spokesmen other spokesmen on the public scene on soul of reason and they too have raised some of these questions. One of the questions that I believe is Basil Paterson brought up when he was on the program is to what extent do black Americans have the clout in order to demand that many of the campaign promises that people make toward black Americans be delivered.

Franklin Williams 00:17:01.351
Well back to Africa. I was going to make that same point following the riots in Soweto and the slaughter if you will of hundreds of young black high school boys and girls. There was hardly a whisper or an expression of national concern on the part of black Americans. I felt at the time that millions of us should have been demonstrating in the streets pounding on the doors of the White House and city halls and state office buildings demanding that our political leaders speak out in condemnation of that slaughter. Had we done so perhaps this administration would have responded and have taken some kind of leadership. I think we're too, we're too quiet on these issues as a race. I think we bear some of the responsibility. And after all President Carter is Vance and everybody else they're politicians and if they think that they can get away with a minimum of action they're going to get away with a minimum of action and black America has simply not spoken out forcefully enough on the questions that you and I are talking about in southern Africa.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:18:07.940
Now I would concur about that completely. I think that part of this goes back to the so-called revolution of the 60s where many black Americans adopted African names and motifs and so on without (and wrote) really totally understanding what it meant. And whereas we have a number of independent African nations frankly every nation except Southern Africa is independent now somehow or another the message hasn't gotten across that the same type of oppression and brutality and instant slavery that we black Americans fought to overcome in the 19th century our black brothers in southern Africa fighting to overcome in the 20th century and that message hasn't gotten across yet.

Franklin Williams 00:18:51.230
And some of our black brothers in Central Africa too in Uganda a lot. Let's not forget the killer Idi Amin. It's not just a question of race I am shocked that so few black Americans have spoken out in condemnation of that man. He's a vicious killer he has killed hundreds of thousands of his own people and we remain quietly not protesting. Those are our brothers and sisters that are being killed. He's destroyed one of the greatest universities in Africa. He's got himself an Army that is not representative of the Ugandan people most of them are mercenaries many of them from the Sudan. We in America are the main support of that government where the main purchases of Uganda Coffee. The only way that man's going to be overthrown is if his economy is permitted to go into economic ruin. And yet we continue to supply him with the with jeeps with trucks with spare parts. We buy his coffee. There's a Ugandan coffee office right here in New York City. And we're the largest purchaser of Ugandan coffee. Great Britain is a major trading partner of Uganda whereas all of our concern with morality. It's not just Southern Africa. I admit that that it took me a long time to recognize that Amin in many ways is as vicious as Vorster. One hates to face up to the reality but I don't see how we can how we can fail to face that now Roscoe and to speak out on it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:20:20.631
Of course, you really analyze one of the reasons why it is difficult for black Americans to criticize a black African leader. For example his style and his flamboyance and even sometimes his arrogance is something that the average black man in the street gets a big kick out of when he puts a white man under a carriage that he has to carry him through the streets.

Franklin Williams 00:20:42.770
That's fine. But when he slaughters tens and tens and tens of millions of our brothers and sisters simply because they're members of a different tribe or simply because they don't show the proper kind of obeisance to him then I'm afraid that I'm going to criticize a black leader as quickly as I will a white leader.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:20:58.970
I think the logic is very clear. But again it may go back to the lack of information. If you read some of the black press for example it's always printed thusly. It is alleged that hundreds of thousands of people. But I mean denies it and then they send a writer over and you probably know who it is. One of the writers for the black press and they extolled and that is part of public information.

Franklin Williams 00:21:29.990
Well I have a tremendous respect for the president of Tanzania and I have a tremendous respect for the president of Zambia. I happen to think that Julius Nyerere is one of the great men of the century and happens to be one of the most honest and responsible national leaders we have on any continent in this world. And Julius Nyerere refuses even to sit in the same room with Idi Amin and his foreign minister told me personally, personally that the numbers of Ugandans that had been killed have not been exaggerated in the press report. I heard the same thing from the president of Zambia. I have to take their word for it. I'm not in a position to know. I have not seen people slaughtered in Uganda. I've talked to the former chief justice. I've talked to the former foreign ministers I've talked to all kinds of Ugandans who have fled that country. There's something amiss. And I for one believe the time has come for black Americans to speak out in condemnation of Amin and to bring pressure to bear on our country to cease doing business with Amin just as we bring pressure to bear on our country to cease doing business with Rhodesia in South Africa.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:22:36.920
Have you applied to go to Uganda?

Franklin Williams 00:22:40.250
No I have no desire to go there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:22:42.351
I see. Do you think it is in the interests of--

Franklin Williams 00:22:44.670
I've not been to South Africa either.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:22:46.101
Do you think that if you did apply you'd be given a chance to go.

Franklin Williams 00:22:49.731
I don't know.

00:22:50.891
You know I know one situation--

Franklin Williams 00:22:53.391
Why don't you go Roscoe? I don't buy until--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:22:55.701
A radio announcer had criticized Uganda and the Ugandan mission invited him over to visit. He reported what he saw but it was very clear and he admitted that he wasn't taken into certain places.

Franklin Williams 00:23:11.390
How much can you see if a man in the army has destroyed a village. Let's say you're not going to see that village you'll be brought to the capital you'll be given the red carpet treatment. You'll see all of the sycophants surrounding the leader and you'll come back and applaud the same thing happens to people who go to South Africa. They don't they don't really see the slave labor on the farms in the southern part of the country where they are taken out of the prisons and they're they're sold by their day to local farmers as a matter of fact. Most black Americans who go there never even hear of that kind of thing. They see the obvious they see the signs that reflect apartheid and segregation but they don't see the real human degradation and suffering that goes on just as if somebody were to come to this city or to this country you're not going to get into if you are just a traveller being taken around the United States into the heart of the ghettos of Harlem and to see the rats and the roaches and the filth and the the degradation under which our people live of course not no less to see the deep and humanizing of people that goes on in our prisons.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:24:20.360
Your point is well taken and in that regard and of course that's the reason why it's important for people like yourself to speak out and it's important for programs like ours to entertain these issues because what you've highlighted on anything else is that there needs to be a tremendous amount of consciousness-raising regarding the situation in southern Africa mainly among blacks certainly among whites but mainly among blacks because the black constituency 28 million people could become a very effective power bloc for Southern Africa

Franklin Williams 00:24:51.131
And Roscoe well for blacks all over the world. I happen to believe when a black brain is destroyed anywhere in the world I am destroyed. There are two you know we've we've had to pay too great a price to develop the kind of leadership that we have all over the world whether it's in South Africa or in Uganda or in Mississippi. And when black people are destroyed because they think because they speak because they demand their human rights then I have to speak out in support of them and in condemnation of those who would destroy them whether they be Ugandans whether they be Ethiopians whether they be South Africans or Rhodesians.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:25:26.230
Now that has been my position as well. Through our Institute at New York University we have contacted some 300 college campuses to try to get the black student unions to become involved in a campaign for freedom in southern Africa. And I have to tell you that the response has been very very poor. We've gotten 15 responses. That's a lot. It could be of course the quality of the appeal but also it really relates to the sensitivity that our people now have about southern Africa.

Franklin Williams 00:25:53.450
And it takes organizational leadership. I'm pleased that the NAACP is beginning to show a great interest in in giving some leadership on the African questions I was privileged to be vice chairman of a task force that Margaret Bush Wilson appointed that went to Africa and we made a series of recommendations to their national board which we hope will be and I'm sure will be considered and hopefully acted upon.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:26:18.920
All right one last thing as we come to a close the program. What about the impact of Andy Young on the United Nations on the world.

Franklin Williams 00:26:27.610
And very quickly I think Andy Young is the best thing that's happened to us in several decades. He's honest he's forthright he's gutsy. And the more people criticize him the more it suggests to me that he's saying and doing something right. Andy is not intimidated by criticism. He knows what he's doing. He's telling the truth. And I happen to believe he's doing a very diplomatically. We all have our own styles I might have done it differently but I couldn't have done it any better. And I think Andy has brought issues front and center. Racism has been a bad word that people didn't want to mouth but it's the reality of our life and certainly the reality of our country if not of the world. Andy's brought it front and center. People have had to face it. I think he's doing a marvelous job. I applaud the president for not only appointing him but continuing apparently to support him and I sincerely hope that he continues to speak out and to move vigorously. Matter of fact I don't think Andy Young is going far enough. If you want to know the truth I think that he's probably going as far as he's able to go in this position but I continue to reserve the right to be a critic of his as well on Southern Africa because I think he should be taking even stronger positions

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:27:42.872
Because one of the problems that an ambassador has is that in part he has to take instructions State Department

Franklin Williams 00:27:48.862
Of course he's the he's the personal spokesman for the president and there are limits to what he can do and that's why I admire Andy I think Andy has pressed to the extreme of those limits and he's to be admired and supported by us for doing that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:28:03.771
Do you think he will survive.

Franklin Williams 00:28:05.651
I know I think he'll survive. I think Andy has a pretty good chance of being a president of the United States in my lifetime.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:28:12.140
That's a beautiful way in which to close our program this evening. We've been talking with Franklin Williams President of the Phelps Stokes Fund and former United States ambassador to Ghana. And we've been talking about the situation in southern Africa and what might be done particularly among black Americans to help overthrow the yoke of oppression and the denial of majority rule in southern Africa. Thanks again Frank for being our guest on soul of reason.

Franklin Williams 00:28:36.050
Thank you Roscoe.
