Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:00:01.520
This is Soul of Reason, a program that tells what's happening in Black America. Each week on NBC leaders and movers in the Black community visitSoul of Reason to discuss important concerns of Black New Yorkers. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Junior adjunct Professor of Education at New York University and President of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. Tonight our guest is Arnold Webb who's Executive Director of the Division of Education of New York City's Board of Education. And the New York City schools are in the news so frequently these days. Things like the school calendar, school vacations, racial integration among the pupils, racial integration and assignment of teachers, open schools, career education, reading levels, accountability andArnold Webb has all of these things under his general direction with the possible exception directly of school integration. So Arnold we're glad to have you with us this evening. And I'd just like to give you a chance to tell our audience exactly what you think. The 77 /78 school year looks like.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:01:08.451
Well Roscoe, we are still presented with some very very serious problems in terms of budget, in terms of having sufficient resources to do the kind of job that we'd like to do. But I think that we have turned a corner budgetarily. We have begun to come back This year fortunately we were able to restore several thousand teachers to the teaching roles. We have received some funds that will help us to provide some additional support and programs for the gifted. We are moving ahead on many fronts in terms of innovative programs. This does not in any sense mean that we are problem free or that we don't anticipate some problems in certain areas.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:57.601
And that's about the biggest understatement I've heard about this year. You don't, you don't think you're problem free. Given the fact that the courts and the federal government have really given you a go round in terms of racial integration. I imagine a lot of the attention of the board members and even the executive staff people devoted to these two issues. One being the Andrew Jackson case, which has to do with the assignment of white people to a school has I think three white people white pupils in it. And the other has to do with the ATW Board of Education agreement to assign the teachers who are returning on the basis of selections from a pool of white teachers for one selection and Black teachers for another. To what extent has this really caused the board any real problems in terms of getting started? I know it certainly causes them image problems and is a very very serious public problem public policy problem.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:02:56.971
It is a serious public policy problem, and what has actually happened is that the Office of Civil Rights was very very much concerned over the staff integration picture in The New York City schools. And Indicated to us that there might be a problem in terms of some of our federal funding. So we might conceivably lose some money. Therefore it was incumbent upon the board to to provide a plan and a program whereby they could show the Office of Civil Rights that we were indeed doing whatever could possibly be done in terms of providing more integration of staff, and trying to do something about a picture that shows in some community school districts virtually and in schools and those districts virtually and all white staff and in other districts and schools virtually and all Black staff. So that those several thousand teachers who were returned to school this year. In the return of those teachers every attempt was made to send the Black teachers to areas where there had not been many Black teachers in the past and conversely to send the white teachers to what were Black schools.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:04:09.820
Well the public reaction to this has been generally negative. We have several interacting factors. For example, many many more Black parents now would like to have or Puerto Rican parents would like to have teachers of their ethnic background teaching their students. At the same time there is still enough racism in our society where many white parents do not want Black or Hispanic teachers teaching their students. So we have a number of interacting factors, and particularly with organizations like the NWAC legal defense fund that is still pressing for racial integration among its pupils. Even though in certain areas blocks on blocks miles on Miles are predominantly Black. And this leads to some philosophical conflicts as well as some legal conflicts. And I can't help but... wonder how you folks manage to operate on a day by day basis providing quality education in this climate of social upheaval? How do you do it?

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:05:13.340
I don't know that we do it to the extent that we would like to. And I can't sit here and tell you that we do provide a quality education across the city because that's one of the things that we do need to address. And I think the very fact that you mention that we have organizations Black organizations pressing for integration of school children and yet at the same time we have some Black groups and Black organizations who are very very much concerned over the fact that in pressing for staff integration the board is assigning some Black teachers to white areas. And conversely white teachers to some Black areas. And I really believe Roscoe that if we're going to make some inroads into some of the interpersonal problems that we have some of the inter-ethnic tensions that we have. That it is essential that we have the kind of staff integration that we're pushing for in terms of the kids. That we do the same thing with the staff. This is not in any sense to say that we're going to take, we're going to remove the Black role models from Black areas. That's not what we're saying. But what we are saying is that if we have a school in an area that is primarily Black, that in addition to having Black teachers and Black leadership in that school that there ought to be white teachers and that this is a good kind of thing for the kids to see too.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:06:31.050
Of course that really puts you and everyone else under the gun. In a sense policy, and this is a policy issue is made by the Board of Education who are appointed people who get do get paid however for doing their particular responsibility and are related to the general political milieu of the city. In other words, people on boards of education are not apolitical.

Dr. Arnold Webb 00:06:56.911
Far from it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:06:58.011
On the other hand professional educators like yourselves are supposed to be as much as possible apolitical in terms of your general process of carrying out education. Yet when you come upon these social issues you really do get thrust into the political cauldron. For example to say to a parent or group of parents say well look we worked so hard to get us dedicated teaching staff of either Black or Puerto Rican Hispanic teachers that provide role models and are interested in the pupils. And then you going to bring in white teachers many of whom or some of whom are not as interested. Now how do you answer that particular question? Because I for one don't believe that all people of any group fall into one particular stereotype, but there is enough feeling particularly minority communities that a considerable number of the white teachers don't really either identify with the pupils and are able to work with them or care. How do you answer that when a parent asks you that question? Answer it two ways. First of all, as much as we may like to say that educators, the professional educator is apolitical, it's not true. If you're in a position of educational leadership in an urban center such as New York City, you darn well better be aware of what the political forces are and what the contending forces are. And you must learn to deal with them and cope with them. And that in no sense compromises your role as a professional educator. In fact it can enhance your effectiveness as an educator. Now secondly, in regard specifically to the to the question that you ask, how do you deal with the fact that some people in the Black community may perceive white teachers as coming in as being less concerned with their children than are the Black teachers who are there. Our concern is professional educators is with providing the best kind of quality education that we can for kids and that's what we're concerned with and that's what we deal with. Where we have teachers, and I must say that Black teachers have no monopoly on being good teachers or being most responsive to kids any more than white teachers do. We have good teachers and bad teachers among both groups. Our job and our responsibility is to deal with a training program that will help teachers in terms of attitudinal change, in terms of- Very often part of the problem in dealing with an ethnic group with which you may not be familiar is kind of a fear of the unknown. There are all kinds of tales and stories that teachers may hear. What they need is the kind of training, and background, and curriculum materials that will give them a security in dealing with kids. And very often any teacher worth his salt is going to realize something; that a child is a child and he's there and he needs help but it's your job to provide it. So we hope to provide the support and the training for these people and we think it can work and we think in the final analysis our children will benefit from it. I think that's a really good explication of what type of problems you face and how you go about dealing with those problems. Now one of the problems that you face that has ethnic considerations is a problem of discipline. There have been several suits that have suggested that the Board of Education's policy of excluding students because of disciplinary reasons is discriminatory because a large number of minority youth are excluded from school. Yet one of the concerns both on the part of teachers and the part of parents is the escalation of the physical violence that occurs in the school. Not only by people who come into the school from the community and the streets but also from the pupils themselves. And add to that the fact that the average 'thirteen year old youth might be you know 5 '10 and weigh a hundred and sixty-five and a junior high school teacher might be 5'3 and weigh a hundred and twenty. Again, I can't say that I envy your job and your role in the Board of Education. On the other hand, I personally respect your judgments and the way you go about it.

Speaker 8 00:11:01.310
What is the situation with regard to discipline. What's being done about it. What about the allegations that exclusion procedures are unfair. Not only the black dude but anyone who's excluded some advocates have said it's the role of the school as an agent of society to do something help Rizzo's realize these youngsters and exclusion either excluding them and putting them in a homogeneous population or excluding them physically from school is not really the way to do this. How do you deal with those issues.

Speaker 5 00:11:32.110
You ask some tough questions. I I see myself as an extension of the community. The stench is apparent.

Speaker 8 00:11:38.060
I can identify with a parent who has a kid walking through the schools as I do with some of my family members.

Speaker 9 00:11:45.180
Now it's a it's a it's an absolutely valid question and it's one that we certainly do have to address. I think first of all there. There is no question at the level of violence in the school and some of the problems some of the acting out problems of kids has increased not that it has increased I think to the extent that most people might think because unfortunately Roscoe the media seizes very often upon the story that will have within it an element of violence or that will play up the fact where we have a teacher who has been derelict in one dramatic way or another rather than playing up some of the very many success stories that we have. But in any event I think that it is a responsibility that we have as educational leaders to provide the kind of climate that will enable a teacher to teach and teach it to do its job so that some kind of mechanism has to be set up whereby we can deal with those children who are not being responsive to the school situation.

Speaker 4 00:12:51.620
And that can take a number of forms. One of the things that happens is that they have a kind of a five day exclusion policy where a child can be suspended for a period of five days a principal suspension kind of thing. During that period of time kind of a cooling off period right after that then there is a conference that is held supposedly so the child can come back to school. I agree that one of the things that is most alarming about the suspension mechanism is that it seems to be. Heavily. Heavily weighted in terms of the the minority community and the minority kids. And it's a problem that needs to be looked at needs to be addressed. We do a number of things we do provide and I think this is where the answer lies. The answer is to provide the kind of educational program that's going to motivate a kid that's going to make a kid feel that he is achieving some measure of success. Very often these overt acts that are committed are indications of hostility and they really when you look at them their cries for help they're saying I'm not making it in a school situation you're not giving me what I need. All I experience in a school day after day is a failure. And so we try to provide alternative kinds of programs. We have a very expensive alternative high school program for example where we've achieved really very remarkable successes with kids who've had a history of failure from the time they began school who suddenly are now beginning to achieve and who are now using in the school situation and who most important of all are now attending on a on a regular basis. There is something that is growing in New York City that I'm very very excited about and that is where we have what we call Educational Opportunity Schools in high schools where we have entire high schools that are going to be devoted toward helping to prepare kids along special career lines. With an emphasis on working with minority kids for example Hillcrest High School is we are working now on a program to provide make Hillcrest High School a place where children can prepare for medical careers with an emphasis on bringing in minority kids.

Speaker 8 00:14:58.770
We have August Martin in aviation we have Beach Channel High School in marine sciences and ecology so that we try to provide the kind of program that's needed but it doesn't mean that the problem is going away because it's not tonight I'm sorry the reason we're discussing the New York City schools and the problems that they face in various approaches with Dr. Arnall Webb who's executive director of the division of education of New York City Board of Education. Now one of the things that has caused the New York City schools to get really a bad general reputation. And I think it's undeserved because I do believe that there are far far more good things that occur very seldom do we talk about our great music programs in schools like the High School of Performing Arts and the High School of Music and Arts or Martin Luther King a very seldom do we talk about the fact that we really usually do have the best basketball team the best track teams in the country the fact that the people who won the mathematics Olympics generally come from our high schools so we tend not to really praise our school system as much as we should. On the other hand many of those things do come out of specialized interest that people tend to pursue. But one of the things that cause the New York City for education to get a black eye in a sense has been its performance and reading test. Now of course this is a national phenomenon. It's a phenomenon that affects urban children throughout the country. But certainly people need to be able to read the newspaper to be able to read the labels of food products be able to read driving instructions medical instructions and other simple instructions in order to enter the labor market. What then are you doing in the New York City public schools to deal with the fact. That in some instances. Half of the children who are leaving the 6th grade to go into junior high school can't read at the fourth or fifth grade level. What are you doing about that. Not you per say but the schools under your leadership.

Speaker 9 00:17:02.040
I think we're moving on on several fronts. Most particularly. Sometime next week there will be a press release and a press conference held by the Chancellor and the president of the board. That's going to launch a new center for reading education in New York City schools. This will be a center whose personnel will have as this as their sole responsibility the improvement of reading the development of reading skills making a frontal attack upon the problem of achievement in reading that is has plagued us for so long. We would hope that this center will begin be the beginning of a major effort of the New York City schools to cope with the problem. We are looking not only for a tax levy support for it but we would hope to get a number of outside funding sources to join in with this. We have had meetings with the colleges and universities in the area who will be working with us in this center for reading.

Speaker 5 00:18:10.820
What kind of things will actually be done. Because one of the things the society is really concerned about is that every time is a problem. We get some money. We have a press conference and we announce a new thrust. Our new task force to turn it around and regionally things don't turn around that fast. Okay fair a fair question. We would hope to have it broken up into several areas that maybe we have not addressed as.

Speaker 9 00:18:37.540
Readily as we needed to. For one we hope to have a clinical aspect to the Center for Reading where we are looking toward possibly being able to set up reading clinics located in various geographic areas throughout the city so that children with severe difficulties in terms of reading will be able to get the kind of clinical and expert assistance that they that they need. We would hope to have a research component of the center where research will be done with children and based upon a real hard look at achievement tests and reading tests and what do they mean and what are they doing. We would hope to involve every single school district in the city on a direct basis with the Center for Reading In terms of training in terms of dissemination of information in terms of replicating.

Speaker 10 00:19:27.160
Programs that work in one district and helping it to move into a another district. There's something else that we're doing that impacts directly on reading that we think is a most exciting project and that is in connection with in conjunction with the city of Washington in the city of Philadelphia.

Speaker 11 00:19:44.490
And of course we know that the problems that we face in New York are not unique to New York. They're urban school problems. And so we have tried to establish liaison and contact with some of the urban city cities in the in the east and the Eastern Seaboard. But with Washington and Philadelphia we're involved in a special television project called the capital cities TV project whereby we will be working. With. Television scripts. Programs that children. Ordinarily watch. You know sometimes we can say as educators to a child you should watch this program. It promises to be a very good program it's a very educational program. Sometimes that can be the kiss of death. But what do you do with you have a kid who watches a program as a matter of course. And I could mention any number of programs that kids watch. Sanford and Son Sanford and Son right. Found it all in the family right. Would be would be examples. And we are receiving scripts of those programs which will several months in advance. With accompanying teacher guides at various levels and through using these scripts. We're going to be dealing with a number of the language arts skills comprehension skills and reading skills and the like so that when a child actually watches that program he will have had a whole background and a whole motivational force.

Speaker 12 00:21:06.030
We're going to be involved in what that sounds like such a good idea. That type of thing that as a citizen I would be moved to ask the question Why don't teachers and the education do more of things like that. Many of the books as you know deal with topics in areas that are either not very much interested or somewhat sterile. It's true that I think Plato was a great person in the Roman Empire was very interesting but if I am on the streets all day and I hear certain kind of language and see certain kind of things that's not really going to move me a great deal to learn how to read. Neither is Dick and Jane. So stories about Dick and Jane. So the question I am asking you is why do we have to have a major crisis in order for these very creative and almost common sense ideas to come to the fore. And I know I'm putting you on the spot with this but I know well I know. I can answer that. You know it was ever thus and very often maybe it's crisis that that brings us to what to our finest hours and in these things and I do know that one of the things that I did this is on a national scale that we've been that people have been trying to do for years as to how can we.

Speaker 11 00:22:19.080
Harness that that incredible force upon our lives of television and really make it work in the classroom. And we really think that this may be the beginning of an answer it's been done we tried it on a very minor kind of pilot basis last year and we achieved and I think some very striking results. And if we can do this on a broad scale. If we can say that we can take the television watching and the child is going to do anyhow and transform that into an experience that's going to help them learn we really will have done something. You saw for example the the committee the works committee that came out with a report on a declining S.A.T. scores and one of the reasons that they cited for the declining scores was the thousands and thousands of hours the children spend watching television that it takes away from other kinds of activities.

Speaker 12 00:23:05.640
Yet at the same time it can be and I think is a very powerful instrument of learning. Do you think this is a problem for many of us in society is that people earn every day. I mean that's just part of the human organism part of living. The real problem is that what people learning doesn't fit in with what certain other people particular business and industry think that they need to learn or to learn or skills they need for their own basic survival. And one of the problems that everyone in education has is try to match up this capacity. And I would say a great desire to learn with the needs of society and the needs of the individual. And that really is a tough job. Let me turn to just another part of your work. A lot of your work deals with career education. As a big controversial education as to whether you should prepare people expressly to become the say a key punch operator. Or a supermarket clerk or whether you teach some broad general skills reading math skills some more useful use of the hands skill to go into labor market. What's your personal philosophy on this and what is the Board of Education doing in relationship to this issue. We have a. Very extensive.

Speaker 13 00:24:26.030
Career Education operation within the board that encompasses both in school and in school training and training for people who have been dropouts and training for adults. Our emphasis. Rather than being on specific skills.

Speaker 11 00:24:48.530
For a specific job is on the matter of providing a broad enough range of skills so that they can be applied to a job. Now in some areas for example in our manpower training project where we have specific skill centers where they work in all automobile mechanics and that kind of thing we do relate to a specific job. But many of our other programs in Career Ed are shared instruction program a Bronx Community Counseling Center and some of the other things that we do are dealing more with trying to develop the kind of background and training and the kind of attitude toward work that will stand young people in good stead. You know. One of the major problems that we face in this country and it's a potentially explosive problem is one that every facet of society needs to address is what do we do about youth unemployment. Most particularly what do we do about the appalling statistics of minority youth unemployment. Well as educators that's that's an indictment of us. It's an indictment of the kind of system that the kids have come up under the kind of education they have. We have to address it.

Speaker 12 00:25:58.310
I really would differ with you and I think the youth unemployment issue is an indictment of the economic capacity of society because even if people didn't have skills there are not a lot of jobs in our society. I concur that the education system has a certain amount of culpability but I really do believe that the economic problem in the society is the one that contributes to this high unemployment rate and it is reciprocal. But I don't want to make the schools a whipping boy. I think I've done a pretty good job in the schools and having boy at night. Oh I didn't want to take you off the hook.

Speaker 11 00:26:31.110
OK thank you I appreciate that. No I didn't mean to give the impression that the schools are solely responsible for the problem but I'm saying that let's put it this way. That we certainly feel a responsibility to try to provide. A kind of program that's going to help to alleviate this problem. One of the things that is is that the federal government is doing and we're happy to see it the president just sign this bill a couple of weeks ago is that there is going to be a youth. Demonstration and training act. Just passed which is going to mean that some 22 million dollars across the country is going to be provided for in school training and in school projects related to youth employment.

Speaker 10 00:27:12.260
New York City stands to get about four million dollars of that and we have already begun to do our preliminary planning in terms of how these funds will be utilized to impact upon the. The problem of youth employment.

Speaker 12 00:27:25.850
Well what type of things are actually happening in the schools today on employment. Do you have employment centers. Do you help with placement if a merchant comes and says Well look I need X number of people to do keep punching an industry do you set up programs to train and keep punching. What about some things like that.

Speaker 11 00:27:45.980
Well we do have programs. We've had one program and since then it's been operating for about.

Speaker 10 00:27:52.130
50 years in the school system to a cooperative education program which is a work study kind of project whereby children go to school for a week and work for a week and get their their full school credit for it. This is a program that we're presently we have thousands of young people who are employed and who get to get an introduction to the to the world of work. We have a number of other programs we have are what we call our welfare or education plan and our adult basic education programs where we are working with young adults who have been unsuccessful in the school situation toward helping them first to gain general equivalency diploma and then a high school equivalency diploma. We have a number of various types of skills centers where we are providing young people with opportunities for jobs but I think we've only just begun to scratch the surface on that but as we come to the close the program tonight what would you ask of the public if you were to ask something of the public in New York City school. What would you ask.

Speaker 11 00:28:58.460
I would ask them to continue the effort that has started over the last few years to know what's happening in your schools to make your schools accountable to demand to be a part of the process and to do something about the really appalling abysmal lack of interest in school board elections become a part of the process.

Speaker 12 00:29:19.980
I have guest on tonight so the reason has been the doctor on a Web who's executive director of the division of education of the New York City Board of Education and we've been talking about the problems and challenges of the New York City schools. This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for soul of reason. This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with NBC.
