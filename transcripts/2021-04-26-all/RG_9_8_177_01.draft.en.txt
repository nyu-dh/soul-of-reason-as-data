Speaker 1 00:00:21.830
This is Soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:24.110
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:00:49.340
The well-known writer John Oliver Killen's author of cotillion and other novels has been recently writing a book on one of the greatest of Russian writers Alexander Pushkin. Tonight on the sole reason we'll be talking with John Killen's about his book. And John we're really glad to have you with us on this particular edition of solar reason. And as we were remarking for the show you were the first guest on solar reason when we premiered in the first week of May in 1971. And at that time we were talking about your book cotillion which is going to be a great success both the literary success and also a dramatic and musical success. So we welcome you back to Sola reason.

Speaker 4 00:01:32.450
I'm very proud to be back and probably the show itself helped to set cotillion off you know and give it a good sendoff. That's really beautiful and I think that's one of the things that black.

Speaker 5 00:01:47.270
Writers and critics and artists need to do we need to talk about our art and we need to help the public to understand it. And your new project the Pushkin project is really one of the most exciting things that I've heard about when I was a youngster.

Speaker 6 00:02:02.630
I heard that I was handed Pushkin was black and I was gonna do my was black and Hannibal was black and Alexander Hamilton was black.

Speaker 3 00:02:09.919.9999999999854
And lots of other people in the black historian Jay Rogers said were black some of whom were and some weren't. But the Pushkin story always appealed to me because Russian novelists like Tolstoy endorse JFK. We're just sort of obscure in our culture. And then all of a sudden they become the so-called in group. And yet we don't hear as much about Pushkin as we've heard about those giftee and Tolstoy. And I was wondering how you yourself became interested in Alexander Pushkin and what you did to develop this interest.

Speaker 7 00:02:45.530
Well as just like you I'd heard of Pushkin and sometime you know old J Rogers had claimed so many great people some of us probably thought they were figments of his wish fulfillment. But one day in Brooklyn New York I was minding my own business I got a telephone call from Paris and Belafonte was telling me that he'd been hanging out with some Soviet film producers all day and they wanted to to do a film on Alexander Pushkin and what Belafonte to play the role of Pushkin. And he told me I was a guy to do the film a screenplay. He asked me what I thought that what was the greatest idea of a head. And he said well why in the hell ought to start the research has he I'm on my way up to the Schoenberg knife. He'd let me off the telephone. I went up the next day and spent about three weeks often on up there came away with about a hundred pages of Pushkin research. By the time Harold got back from Europe he had about 20 or 25 books by about Alexander Pushkin for whatever reason the Pushkin film project fell through. But by that time I was hooked. I had an afro Russian on my back and enjoying it.

Speaker 8 00:04:00.080
Well you said the film project fell through. Do you think this is because of the fact that the larger. American critical and literary world doesn't completely understand the importance of Pushkin or is it just the old question of racism.

Speaker 7 00:04:17.269.9999999999709
No I don't think it's just one of those things that didn't come off. You know I have no idea because these were Russian film produced and people who they know Pushkin. It's just one of those projects like I went to Africa once and suppose to do a documentary on West Africa the man who boss didn't get reelected. So I took care of that. Thirty thousand dollars went down the drain you know.

Speaker 6 00:04:40.160
All right let's give the audience a little background about Pushkin. Where was he born. What about his black ancestry.

Speaker 9 00:04:48.590
To what extent is black interest free affect his work.

Speaker 10 00:04:51.830
Is development as a creative artist Pushkin was born in Moscow. But his black and sesame came from a great grandfather who was an Ethiopian. In the days of Peter the Great who the czar Emperor of Russia it was fashionable to have at least one one negro in your Imperial Court a black and white as we would call in those days. And Peter the Great Being a Europhile felt that he had really have at least one Negro in his court so he sent out the words to all the European embassies find me a Negro.

Speaker 7 00:05:31.680
Meanwhile the Ethiopians and the Turks had been engaged in war.

Speaker 10 00:05:36.190
And one of the skirmishes a young African prince was captured and brought to a haram in Turkey where they intended to train him to be a eunuch. Fortunately on fighting the pin on your point of view he was kidnapped by Russian ambassador Tolkien brought to the court of Peter the Great. Peter the Great. Took a liking to him. He was highly intelligent strikingly handsome therefore he he was promoted rapidly from footman to lackey to personal secretary to his most Imperial Majesty. Peter took it as was the age of 16 at the age of 17. He he accompanied Peter on a trip through Europe ended up in France. Peter left him in pairs to get an education in Army engineering where he stayed for some time. He came back from Paris finally and he was a he was became a general in the army. He acquired an estate with a thousand serfs.

Speaker 1 00:06:46.320
He was a big man and in Peter's court he he lived almost 100 years.

Speaker 7 00:06:54.170
He is the great grandfather of Alexander. So give Pushkin who is the father of all Russian literature.

Speaker 5 00:07:00.870
And his name is animal.

Speaker 7 00:07:04.130
Abraham Petrovich. Hannibal. I meant to tell you that Peter the Great was his godfather the queen of Poland was his godmother. So he was a highly respected man.

Speaker 6 00:07:14.360
I see now in terms of Pushkin himself. I was his grandfather. That's the general. Which means then that he was born in Russia. Pushkin Pushkin was born in Moscow in Moscow. Now what about his education 79.

Speaker 7 00:07:30.980
He got he was born of the aristocracy on both sides. It's his great grandfather was an African prince his on the on the Pushkin side. They were from the nobility that went as far back as Peter the Great and even further back to Alexander Nevsky. So he was of the aristocracy from both sides. But by the time he got down to Pushkin they were pretty poverty stricken aristocrats like some of those in the south know after the Civil War.

Speaker 10 00:07:59.100
But fortunately Pushkin went when he was a high school age. He went to an elite school to where the educated people who they were supposed to be the leaders of the empire. The future leaders of the empire. That's when he got into a lot of revolutionary mischief and started writing these revolutionary poems. He. He saw a lot of poverty around him. You saw it was a few listing system in Russia at that time and it took a stand against that.

Speaker 4 00:08:33.559.9999999999418
And he he finally when he was 20 years old after he finished his this very very elite education and started he started agitating carrying on against the monarchy. He was banished to the south of Russia where he lived for six years in isolation from his cook from his friends his comrades and his his family.

Speaker 6 00:08:59.150
Now you say he was banished by the monarchy.

Speaker 7 00:09:01.980
I got the impression that maybe the monarchy where some of his relatives at one time monarch of the nobility see they were what they call boys. They were not his relative the monarchy wasn't but he was he was nonetheless and aristocrat who who's against the aristocrats. It was like they say Roosevelt turned against his own kind. You know Pushkin was at that bet.

Speaker 9 00:09:23.680
Now as he was indulging in his political education he was also indulging his creative education whenever there were one and the same.

Speaker 4 00:09:32.630
That's what got him in trouble is poetry here. He was the first writer who who wrote in Russian the rest of the writers before him. One of the first everything was written in French. The Russians had a severe inferiority complex at that time. Visa Europe especially the French. Everything even official documents were written in French. The great writers wrote in French as a matter of fact by the time Pushkin was 11 years old his brothers could boast that he knew all of French literature by heart. He was a child prodigy a genius.

Speaker 9 00:10:09.710
Now it's interesting that with Russian as I understand being a very beautiful language when it finally is read and written why is it that the Russians were so slow to move into their own literary heritage. Is it just because of the inferiority complex or is it because of some of the structure of the language itself.

Speaker 7 00:10:32.270
Well I don't I think it more basically because of the inferiority complex toward Europe.

Speaker 4 00:10:38.720
They were considered contemptuously by the rest of Europe as Bob Asiatic barbarians you know. You know most of Russia is in Asia. This is a vast country that has seven time zones most of it in Asia. The Europeans looked down on it and they reflected that by believing in everything French a man could be a street hoodlum a garbage collector in France and and in Paris in Russia he was a tutor and one of the great Russian households.

Speaker 9 00:11:08.600
Now in terms of Pushkin is reputation as a writer how did his reputation develop. He said he was exiled from Moscow into the southern part of Russia for about six years during that time I believe his reputation began to grow because of his his previous writings.

Speaker 7 00:11:27.320
And if you and he continued to write nothing could stop the flow of his genius. He was isolated and he was lonely he felt some time on appreciated and unloved but he and his friends were sometimes afraid to write to him or come to see him. But nothing could stop the flow of his genes he wrote and wrote and wrote.

Speaker 4 00:11:45.470
He was the first Russian to get paid for his writing also they to see that most of the writing was done by the aristocracy the aristocrats who thought it beneath them to be paid for their work they did it as a dilettante as a pastime you know avocation but Pushkin always said that he wrote by inspiration but haven't written. He was like a cobbler. He would pay for his day's work.

Speaker 6 00:12:12.550
In other words he started the Writers Guild. That's right. Now what about the influence of his black heritage on his writing itself. Is there anything in his writing that particularly reflects his black heritage.

Speaker 4 00:12:26.150
Well I would think that the rhythm of his writing he was very rhythmic writer I would think the rhythm I would think the irony of his is writing is that Ragnar is strong in irony. I think this had something to do with the fact that Pushkin even at the academy at the lycee was concerned with the people at the academy they looked at him. I think they they call him the African. You know at the Academy some some biographers say that's because he's too deep up on tables. But that that does not explanation that I accept. He was very much aware of his African background. Let me read to you a stanza from his most famous novel in voice called Eugene Onegin to show you that something about his loneliness how he felt he says when it strikes my liberation as our it's time it's time a bit at Hale our pace the shore the sky as scar.

Speaker 11 00:13:28.060
And back on to each passing seal storm canopy wave tossed in motion. On balance heroes of the ocean. When do I reach. When unbounded reach. It's time to leave the tedious beach that douse my spirit to be flying where Tara Southern blazed a chore. My own my native Africa. There are dark Russia to be. Was I love. Where now we and where my heart is buried deep. So it's very obvious to me that Pushkin was was a concern with his African. He made many statements against slavery in the United States so he unlikely even do more. Pushkin was a.

Speaker 4 00:14:11.330
Political. Up to here and he's very concerned that with slavery and he tried to get out of Russia Miniter was turned back at the border he went to go to Africa you want to go to China.

Speaker 6 00:14:22.250
That was one question I was going to ask. Did he ever go to Africa.

Speaker 7 00:14:25.250
He never left Russia. Never never. He was always rough Russia was a big prison for him.

Speaker 6 00:14:31.320
Now what about his influence on some of the later Russian writers.

Speaker 4 00:14:35.510
That's a good question. Let me quote Dostoyevsky. You know that as far as America literate Americans are concerned. Tolstoy and dusty FCC are the jars of Russian literature. Nevertheless dusty Baffsky himself said at a Pushkin Memorial when they they celebrated the unveiling of this tremendous statue in Pushkin Square in Moscow. It's a monument and bronze does gifts said and I quote without Pushkin we should have lost not the rich you. But much of our irresistible force our faith in our national individuality.

Speaker 12 00:15:15.440
I believe in the people's power and most of all I believe in our destiny. Franco Russian biography on boy wrote quote Pushkin grew with the years every Russian writer claimed descent from Pushkin inexplicably the whole of Russian literature proceeded from his genius poetry novels short stories history theater criticism. He opened up the whole gamut of literary endeavors to his countrymen. He was the first in time. He was the first in quality. He was the source. Neither Gogol or Tolstoy could have existed without Pushkin for he made the Russian language. He prepare the ground for the growth of every genre.

Speaker 8 00:16:04.270
So I think that answer very very comprehensive David now one of the things I was thinking as you read that is about the Russian language itself.

Speaker 6 00:16:12.170
You said that Pushkin work reflected the rhythms there which are related to African backgrounds and I like as you read that passage which was a translation from Eugenio Nagin I was wondering how that would have sounded in Russia. Do you get the same rises and falls in the inflection. The Russian. Have you heard Pushkin work read in Russian.

Speaker 4 00:16:39.020
I've seen Pushkin movies I've seen his work. There's work written in Russian. There's there's a rhythm to it that that an idiomatic thing although I don't profess to understand Russian thoroughly. But there's a rhythm Pushkin is difficult to translate. I think this is the excuse given by many people why Pushkin is not translated freely in this country. But if they could translate cotillion and in Russia they could translate Pushkin. I cannot accept that excuse. In other words.

Speaker 9 00:17:13.730
So you really think in part it's a historical accident that Pushkin is not recognized at least the United States as much as he should be in terms of the way in which he's recognized in Soviet Union. I do recall hearing you say on one occasion that you I believe had visited Russia and I believe you had visited Pushkin is home and you found just how celebrated he is as a.

Speaker 4 00:17:41.300
Russian figure of the arts. He is the most celebrated writer in Russia. As a matter of fact Bob Johnson of Jet magazine told me that he was in Moscow about four years ago and a Russian peasant woman in Moscow told him there were three national heroes of Russian history. They were Peter the Great Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Pushkin. There's no town of any size in Russia. Doesn't have a statue of Alexander Pushkin.

Speaker 8 00:18:12.760
I think it's really very very significant tonight and so the reason we're talking with John Oliver Collins the author who is currently preparing a book on Alexander Pushkin called The Resurrection of Alexander Pushkin. And I asked you why you have chosen to call the book the resurrection of Alexander Pushkin.

Speaker 7 00:18:30.160
Actually I have a sell on the title the resurrection of Alexander Pushkin is the presentation that I that I made at NYU. That's that I'm resurrecting his name but the thought of calling the title of the novel Great Black Russian. You know there are people in Russia called Great White Russians. And most people know about this so it's kind of ironic title.

Speaker 6 00:18:54.100
You know I see you plan to write a much less of a historical novel about Pushkin rather than a biography.

Speaker 4 00:19:01.660
It's his biographical novel. Yes it's a on the life and times of Pushkin.

Speaker 5 00:19:07.900
It's a I'm a novelist basically and I think I can get closer to the and deep and deepen my understanding and people understand what Pushkin was about through the novel and more than just clear you know stiff stare out sometimes biography when you gave it like let's say I've finished the book you have finished the book when you gave a lecture sometime back at New York University to the Institute for American affairs black scholars lecture series you recounted a scene where Pushkin came back to Moscow I believe it was or to Petrograd one of the towns cities after having been in exile and how these his comrades just welcomed him in tears and indicated that Pushkin was back.

Speaker 6 00:20:00.220
Could you tell us about that.

Speaker 4 00:20:01.330
Well you love a couple of incidents there. He read his play Boris good north in post-war Pushkin came back the the the what do you have to also remember that Pushkin was in exile when Alexander who's in play Alexander we sent him exile died suddenly of a heart attack his brother ascended to the monarchy to the throne and his brother and the Pushkin Congress tried a revolution they tried to overthrow the monarchy and establish a constitutional government they were defeated was abortive and seven of them were hanged hundreds were sent to Siberia. The only reason Pushkin wasn't there wasn't involved was he was already banished to the south of Russia. So Pushkin all of them said that Pushkin inspired them. One that said how can you read Alexander Pushkin. Who hasn't. Who that is Lira has not made Alexander Pushkin. Once you have read him how can you help but fight to change the system. Another one said with attitude I have in life is influenced by that greatest of all Russians. Alexander So give it Pushkin. These people these martyrs of the abortive revolution were known as the Decemberists. That's because it happened on the 14th of December. Pushkin is not still known in Russia as the board of the Decemberists. So is this background that Pushkin the Russian Czar had after hanging so many and sending so many of the intellectuals to to Siberia thought to win some favor from the people and from the orders by pardoning Pushkin and bringing him back to Moscow Pushkin returned to Moscow. He was the man of the hour. Is to say that servants who had Pushkin in Tallinn jumped for joy said that serve Pushkin one evening rid of rough draft of his playboys good enough which were good schools written an opera on is when the most famous plays in Russian literature at the end of the reading the the the play people grabbed him they say long live Alexander Pushkin the genius of our Russian soul. And they kissed him on his bearded cheeks in the they drank champagne to his health. He also one night went to the Moscow Grand Theatre as he entered the theater late. All eyes. He could hear them woman Pushkin Pushkin they as his back is back and he sat down. The play had begun but the murmur of Pushkin Pushkin reach such a wow crescendo that you couldn't hear what was happening on stage and it did not seem to matter. And finally Xu cough skis France's Pushkin you must get up and bowed to the people that acknowledge this reception. This has never happened in the history of the Russian theater. If you don't get up the play can't go. So Pushkin got up and bowed to them and he the people even people the actors on stage applauded the play. The plays were detonated with applause. That evening he left and people follow him down the street hugging and kissing him. The Russians are very expressive you know kissing him and asking him for his autograph. He was indeed a great figure.

Speaker 8 00:23:21.630
Now in terms of the book itself you say the book has been completed. What are the plans for publication.

Speaker 4 00:23:27.470
Well we have until a couple of snags from publishers who shall be nameless a couple of publishers have said they don't know how to promote it. They won't publish all of me in advance which was in reality a rejection you know. Such a small in this reality. It was a rejection. And but so I pull the thing back and I got together priest the resurrection of Alexander Pushkin and I have decided to create a demand for the book and I'm doing some even in I think enriching the book. At this time. I'm so glad they didn't take it to be a better book.

Speaker 8 00:24:09.830
Yes sometimes things happen that way. I was thinking as you were talking about the problems you're having with the book as to the old question that many black students and black scholars critics have raised about relevance.

Speaker 5 00:24:25.940
Why is it relevant to study a person of African descent who happens to be a Russian writer.

Speaker 4 00:24:35.420
Well I think that that so much has been done to the black man's psyche in this country that it is very important for him to understand the impact that men and women of African descent has had not only on American culture but on the world on the world culture. Pushkin is a world figure I think Pushkin is good good for the black psyche in this country. I think it is. It does indicate that I'm repeating myself the impact because Pushkin. There are people who say Pushkin made the Russian psyche centers a man of African descent one of the few in Africa could have this tremendous impact on the Russian people. And they say Tolstoy and asked have said we could not have existed without Pushkin.

Speaker 6 00:25:26.230
Well given this impact that Pushkin has had on Russian culture the arts and even Russian people has this had any effect on their relationship to blacks either blacks from America blacks from Africa because you do hear a number of stories.

Speaker 5 00:25:42.080
Yes most recently by Ambassador Andrew Young saying that the Russians in terms of their collective behavior toward blacks tend to be very prejudiced. We do know about the riots some of the African students have had in the Soviet Union against what they consider to be segregated practices.

Speaker 6 00:26:00.440
We know just from our own experience here in America where we've had many blacks have contributed mightily to the society and have been recognized for it. Yet the collective psyche of the country still hasn't accepted black people as first class citizenship. Is there some of that in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 4 00:26:16.610
Well I was made to trip to the Soviet Union. It's difficult for me to answer that question because when you go as a writer you get that kind of treatment red carpet treatment especially when they knew I was writing about Pushkin. They were but. But order to put toward Pushkin is certainly different from that to the American people to it man that Robeson you know they have constructed statues to him. I don't I wouldn't say there's not racism in Russia but I don't know what bases and the young makes this statement. I'd have to say I've talked to the Indians who know what he's talking about but I didn't see any. When I was in the Soviet Union are there many black people in the Soviet.

Speaker 13 00:27:05.800
Well yes. Well I would call them people of color. They are a part of the Soviet Union which is called us done that. Eleven million people of color that Soviet Union is divided into 15 autonomous republics. This is a republic of as Beck a star. They look like any Negro. There would be a dead Afro-American Studies program the other day. They do not make all the colors you know the clothes that we are and if we were in Tashkent which is a capital ancient city we were that people would assume that we belong. If we wore their costumes and they know their mouths as well affect the very humorous thing happened when I was in Tashkent. My wife and I were in front of the task in hotel and we saw one brother in his row African leg row. Welcome to another brother and the brother slapped his palm. It blew my mind. That's a great look at that. Look at this. Who what. What's the matter. I said this lap and palm. She said You've been drinking too much vodka. Hit. Don't change the subject. The next day we saw a man come up with two hands. They slapped two palms and we asked Tanya who is our interpreter Muscovite school teacher. Ask them what they were doing and they said well when we congratulate each other ones on an accomplishment anything we slap on. We do this.

Speaker 8 00:28:29.680
That's a beautiful point I wish to close tonight's program. I guess to night soul of reason has been John Oliver Collins and we've been talking about his book on Alexander Pushkin and Pushkin magnificent contribution to Russian literature and Russian culture and how it sets a role model for those of us in America who are blacks and recognize the contributions of black people to the world.
