Speaker 1 00:00:01.070
The Metropolitan Applied Research Center better known as Mark is a major non-profit organization concerned with research on matters of urgency to the black community. On July 1 Dr. Charles Hamilton distinguished political scientist assumes the presidency of this prestigious organization succeeding Dr. Kenneth Clarke its founder and first president. Here Dr. Hamilton discussed the future of mark on tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 2 00:00:54.290
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.

Speaker 3 00:01:06.230
Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University with us this evening on soul of reason is Dr. Charles Hamilton who is the new president of mark the Metropolitan applied research center succeeding Dr. Kenneth Clark. And tonight we're going to be talking about what's going to be happening over these next few years with Mark. Glad to have you with us tonight Jack. Good to be here and I hope something is going to be happening. Go ahead. All right let's begin. Because many people even know they've heard of Mark are not really aware of its purpose MRC appears in the newspapers on this cause or that cause of this project of that project. So maybe you could begin by telling us just what the basic purpose of Mark is and dealing with the problems of black people and the problems of the city.

Speaker 4 00:01:55.400
Yeah but no I'm not gonna give you a long historical account but about nine years ago it was felt that it would be useful to have a research organization that would deal with social political problems facing blacks primarily blacks and to also to an extent other minority groups dealing with these problems and seeing what could be done in terms of research and then trying to implement some of that some of those findings the charter the bylaws the official PR pieces of my state that it's an organization involved in social change which is what every organization states of course you know.

Speaker 5 00:02:39.830
So we're not going to be changing money from one pocket to the other. But you're right. Right. Yeah. In your case to be explicit Mark is a nonprofit corporation. Question about it and gets its funding mostly from founder foundations.

Speaker 4 00:02:52.370
Yes. Primarily the larger ones Ford Field Carnegie Rockefeller primarily. And it's been an operation as I say for about nine years. They've been concentrating on a number of issues which have largely followed and understandably Ken Clarke's interests can at large and your listeners knows I'm very active and vibrant member of the Board of Regents in particular concerned with education primarily concerned with education 60 percent of its work. Up to now I think has been on educational matters whether it's Canarsie or the Board of Regents where Washington.

Speaker 3 00:03:32.060
So why do we get to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Now in some ways you function as a consulting agency you enter into contracts with various groups for example the Washington D.C. study we talked about I believe the study that Ken Clarke and Mark were working on to see if they could figure out some way of improving the reading of the children in Washington and out of that came Ken's controversial recommendation that teachers salaries be contingent on the amount of progress they made with their children in reading didn't get very far.

Speaker 6 00:04:05.360
It didn't get very far. But I think that is an example of the type of advocacy that Ken Clarke and Mark and the various other folks who work with Mark have put forth.

Speaker 4 00:04:17.899.9999999999709
That's right. And let me say that's the kind of thing I think that if not that subject matter certainly that kind of orientation should be continued. We're not particularly concerned Bob are 6 1 loss record success record. But Mark Fields and I agree that it has to be a little bit more dynamic a little bit more of venturesome and making suggestions about change. If not then we wouldn't not need to be in existence if we could turn our little shop over to Brookings Institution. We don't style ourselves a Brookings Institution you see.

Speaker 6 00:04:57.720
In other words you're going beyond what is now seen to be possible and suggesting new horizons and new ways of approaching social problems.

Speaker 4 00:05:04.910
Yeah consistent with the title of your program.

Speaker 6 00:05:09.110
You know the soul of reason you know you've got to get in there and tell him I'm getting in there. I know that Mark has spun off other things like the Joint Center for Political Studies in Washington which is sort of a consortium with Mark and Howard University.

Speaker 5 00:05:26.360
Do you plan. I know you're a political scientist and I ask do you plan and continue this is this they say is the sun shining and it's a sunny day join us.

Speaker 6 00:05:33.880
Yeah go ahead. But what do what do you plan to do. For example I joined Santa puts out a publication called Focus tries to focus on the black political experience as a nonprofit organization. I know they are some careful lines you have to trade in terms of political activity but being a political scientist I'm sure that you must have some ideas for mark in this area.

Speaker 4 00:05:56.910
You know I'm not going to at all discontinue the emphasis on education but I'm certainly going to add on to other E's I'm going to develop any of this the staff are listening now. They will have heard this for the first timely your program because I have until a 1st on the 1st of July.

Speaker 7 00:06:17.990
How about that. Then I'm going to develop right now.

Speaker 4 00:06:21.320
Roscoe what I consider a three approach three major areas employment education and elections. I consider that those are tremendously important to minority groups black people in these cities. They're not the only areas we cannot deal with all we go. I'd love to deal with health with housing but we just don't have those sorts of capacities. So I'm going to see if we cannot develop a very good strong expertise in the area of employment. I'm very keenly interested in full employment full employment policy. I think that we're going to continue our emphasis on education. They've developed a fantastic data bank down there at Mark and elections and when I say elections I don't mean the kind of duplicate duplicating the kind of work done a joint center but asking other kinds of questions like What is it people get out of politics anyway. When we ask people to vote why what did they really get. In other words I want to develop what I'm working on a project now dealing with political benefits. When blacks vote in New York City are we really saying and I know you don't want me to come on here and just be bland. Are we really saying that the best blacks can get out of being administration is a deputy mayor named Paul Gibson now that's fine and Paul Gibson probably doing as good a job as he could do but I'm not in straights without question. Sure. So I'm not saying that that is an insignificant appointment but I am asking what is it. In the final analysis.

Speaker 3 00:08:02.720
What is it we can expect from the political system in terms of hard nose benefits and of course the other question the collateral question is why is it that black people only get one deputy mayor in New York City when they comprise together with the other minority populations upwards of 30 or 40 percent of the population.

Speaker 4 00:08:23.090
So those are the kinds of questions I want to be raising. I'm also fundamentally concerned about as everyone has to be now. This whole fiscal problem facing the cities we are. I don't think there's anybody who lives in the cities at any level in this city and particularly who isn't concerned about the budget cuts. The fiscal crisis. So we're going to put together a task force of mark that looks that there's not in a panicky sort of way but begins to look at it to see what sorts of recommendations we can make for the next year's budget.

Speaker 6 00:08:59.660
See as a social thinker you look around New York City you look around Harlem your crime Bedford Stuyvesant and you stand in the middle of this sometimes housing and fiscal ruin and at same time artistic and architectural splendor and you say What can I do to accentuate the palette positive and what can I do to eliminate the negative. And I heard someone criticizing one of our black congressmen for not walking the streets day after day knowing the brothers and sisters on the street saying hello finding what their problems are. But yet when you look at the problems they are so microcosmic they're so large. When you say well gee how do we get into this fiscal mess that we're into in New York City. What can we do to deal with it. And then you back track it you track it into well what are the voting records of blacks. What are the voting records for Hispanics. And I do know and I believe I saw this study coming out of mock that you mock has looked at the registration by election districts where the voting rates.

Speaker 3 00:10:03.440
And I would assume that this would be a type of thing that you would want to look into very much because in order to make the change to where we want to go we have to in a sense understand why we're in a situation we're in. I mean Essam simplistic answers you know poverty and discrimination but beyond that yeah.

Speaker 4 00:10:23.810
Well let me say you know I fundamentally believe that blacks in New York City have not maximize the political potential. I fundamentally believe that. And that means we don't have nearly that the registration and turnout rate in this town that we should have in some areas you get in primaries black turnout. Twelve percent. Now to an extent I understand that. Obviously we understand that. I mean a lot of people will say why Yeah why why why vote. You know what's. But it becomes a self-defeating cyclical thing you see so they don't vote or they don't get anything and so they end up not voting again and so forth. But it's these kinds of things I'd like to get into much more concretely there's another thing that's really been concerning me and a lot of people have been telling me it's it's a no win project and that it's going to simply frustrate us. And that is coordination of social services. A lot of people say look we've been around that bar on a number of times. Well I'm not gonna give up on it. There is a lady for instance who lives in the South Bronx. She has she lives at a public housing project. She's on welfare. She has four children. Three are in school one pre-school age child the lady wanted to get involved in the wind program WRI and become a licensed practical nurse. Well the day she had her appointment her three school aged children were suspended from school because they had disciplinary problems told not to come back until their mother came home. So she had a miss her when appointment go up to the school and so forth. When she finally got to this one program they didn't take her. You have too many other problems so that lady's back in that apartment sitting there on welfare. And I say that's unacceptable. What I'm saying is there are an awful lot of programs for our school in these communities. You know and I know and your listeners know it. Each agency a plethora of programs in Harlem incidentally and at four and a half square mile area called Harlem there 212 social service organizations. OK now but there is a fantastic lack of coordination of these services. There's no reason that lady had to be turned down from the win program because quote she had too many other problems. Now we use the language in you know the language multi problem family and multi service centers and so forth. I'm saying if we do have that kind of situation and if we are pouring millions and millions of dollars into these communities about a billion dollars into Harlem alone in the last 10 years one billion we'd better coordinate them and so that we'll get maximum usage. I'm not talking about more money or new money I'm talking about a maximum usage of money that's already coming into these communities. One last point I want to bore you as a black in East Harlem. There are 16 different or outside organizations servicing the residents in that block. Social service organizations public and private. We've looked at that. Only four know of the existence of the others.

Speaker 3 00:13:49.140
I've seen that in community after community and that's not only true in New York. It's true everywhere that you go into a community as a consultant and all of a sudden you start talking to people and you find out that their agencies are supposedly serving their community and they don't even know each other. Which raises a question as you were talking about attitude state of mind in a sense our black advocates black preachers our black congressmen our black organizations like Marc really have a major job and creating an attitude or a state of mind. I'm talking not only an attitude a state of mind and black people but in terms of service organization. I'll give an example you'll call up a hospital or clinic and you will get the wrong guy went wrong extension.

Speaker 8 00:14:32.330
Now some workers will say well here's the extension in case you get disconnected here's the number. Some others will say he's not here. You got a call information or some others say I'll try to transfer you well know if I can get it. Now the first approach which says I'll give you the maximum amount of information I'll try to help you and if you can't you can do this is a state of mind. And I wonder as I work with both what you may call a lower level bureaucrat and top level administrators have certain top level administrator will say well look I've had to defend myself I've got my legal mandate. I've got to watch out for my auditors. That's his problem over there that's her problem over there. Now what can we do. People who are advocates of one type or another people who have access to the media people who run research organization what can we do to help deal with this. Because the facts that you describe are rampant. We know about that woman in the Bronx. Yeah that's one way spokesman and she has no spokesman for those of us who try to be spokesmen when we run into this someone so says Well that's new york city for you. I'll that's the Department of Science so for you. I personally find that unacceptable. Yet as a social scientist commentator on the human experience I don't know what steps I others should take to deal with that.

Speaker 4 00:15:54.180
Well I think that first of all you know about those situations you compile that kind of information and that's first and a lot of people say but how much more research do you need.

Speaker 9 00:16:04.710
I think you always need it then. I suspect that the next step is the obvious one of mobilization or organized nation at the particular level. For instance I am keenly concerned that we don't have nearly enough active tenants councils or consumer groups. Now it's only at that level it's really that you're going to get the. The motion that's going to lead towards some of that change. I'm noticing this past week the different groups that are rallying in front of City Hall Hall as teachers OK fine. Then there's the the public safety people fine. I don't see any tenants groups. They're low income and they won't be unless there is a specific immediate cataclysmic event like a fire with several deaths you know or something of that nature. Now I'm I don't have the precise answer obviously but it seems to me that the the plain old nitty gritty black association organizing approach the tenants council approach I don't think you can improve on that. I don't think that I think that's the nub. The unit that we're talking about and the organizational techniques are pretty well established. You've got to organize people around their immediate felt needs.

Speaker 3 00:17:37.720
A lot of theorizing and won't do it obviously but let's take this block in East Harlem where this has been organizations outside on impinging on them. And only four of them know of each other that can be multiplied by literally rush hour just to block it on that block.

Speaker 9 00:17:55.020
The most interesting one of the most interesting things this little anecdote I'll be done with it in a hurry. I want to talk to this lady and this lady is on welfare and she's related to nine of those agencies. And she actually starts at nine thirty in the morning with interviews. They come to her and she breaks for lunch one caseworker from another organization then she stays 45 minutes another one comes at 10 15 literally and by the other day she's hit each one for a little allowance for when I'll close a little this for the children's eyes and you know eyeglasses and so forth now and not no coordination.

Speaker 10 00:18:34.050
I don't blame that lady. She's surviving in a way in a bureaucratic jungle in the way that she knows how to survive.

Speaker 9 00:18:41.580
And I would add in no uncertain terms if the dad want a hands of this world. Want to talk about social disorganization in the black family and so forth. I suspect they all sort of talk about bureaucratic disorganization jurisdictional jealousies and what that has done to the black community. But I'm sorry go ahead.

Speaker 6 00:18:58.270
I really think so as the president of Marc the new president Marc one of your roles is to not only identify the problem but to establish some type of intellectual and social leadership around the problem. And frequently we get into this bind and that's really what we've been talking about about the relationship between basic research and applied research. And Mark is known as the Metropolitan applied research center. And we've been talking about all of these problems and you brought up a very interesting one about this one block as always agencies impinging on them.

Speaker 8 00:19:36.780
Now what are some of the strategies and I know that you just can't pull this out of the air because if we had these solutions we would need cooperation like mob but what are some of the strategies that you perceive that you can initiate or carry for you in order to take this research these concerns over to touch the lives of people so that their lives are really different. Well I certainly won't touch that block in East Harlem but I will say well let me ask you question Joe.

Speaker 7 00:20:05.490
You say you won't touch that block of East Harlem on the photograph. Oh no no no. Can I finish with that block.

Speaker 4 00:20:11.880
But take this lady in this public housing project in South Block. Let's call Ms Johnson OK.

Speaker 10 00:20:19.810
She's angry as the devil about not getting into the wind program. She wanted to improve our life.

Speaker 11 00:20:24.360
Now Mark she may not and she may know of one or two other situations like that. Mark we'll have an overview. It's very important that Marc and the process of approaching this project of coordination of social services not do so simply as external social science researchers gathering the data bring Mr. Johnson along with them. Hold those meetings down this and I look you.

Speaker 10 00:20:51.390
This is what you happen to you connect that up with other experiences so that they're not just ad hoc and anecdotal and then suggest and help Ms Johnson and others organize.

Speaker 11 00:21:05.220
Let your research evolve with your organization with your organizing.

Speaker 4 00:21:10.250
And this is the only way. Roscoe I know how to collapse and academe and unless we do that then that language in the title of our organization didn't mean a thing.

Speaker 6 00:21:19.600
One of the things I observed in working with people who are not professionals in many areas is several times they can come up with suggestions very practical suggestions that can help to straighten out the situation. Part of the suggestions might have to do with the way in which the agency changes.

Speaker 12 00:21:37.090
But part of the suggestion might just have to do with creating an attitudinal concern about a particular for example you live in a block where there's a lot of rubble and trash and so on. It doesn't really require federal law or a great act of God to reach down and pick up a piece of rubbish or when you get ready to throw away a bag or something like that look for a container. That's a state of mind. Now that's something that people on high who live in beautiful neighborhoods where they've got all kind of sanitation can preach to people who are in neighborhoods that are less clean and so on but somehow or another we have to get that rapprochement between the identification of the problem and the willingness of both parties in the problem to deal with it.

Speaker 6 00:22:23.010
The sad old cliche I think the Panthers used it. If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem.

Speaker 12 00:22:31.020
And sense this I gather is what the model that you are projecting for Ma to involve people who have the problem in terms of developing a solution. Yeah.

Speaker 13 00:22:41.640
Let me say you know a lot of people say that and that we say it and we mean it but I don't wanna be smug here on your program. It's very difficult to do and I don't want to suggest to you or your listeners that post July 1st I'm going to come in with some hide bound formula on how to pull this off. I think that the most important thing for me to say in talking here with you Roscoe is that we have to be constantly sensitive about those problems. I know also that there is this tension between elites and social scientists on the one hand and a lot of us. Let's face it we we deserve the the criticism the criticism because if it's so wonderful to write books and then you get a lot of credits that way you get tenure.

Speaker 10 00:23:35.910
Maybe it used to but.

Speaker 13 00:23:39.460
And then on the other hand a lot of people haven't seen the results of a lot of the stuff we don't mean we as Mark but we as social scientists do. So there is an awful lot of of establishing of credibility and the most important thing about that is you must always pay your dues. You'll have to pay you pay your dues Once you know in this life you have to pay them all the time.

Speaker 3 00:24:00.550
Now one thing that has come up about involving Indigenous community people in social action etc is that they say well the professionals are getting paid. And if they aren't getting paid they have the economic affluence to spend this time. Some projects have built into the projects paying off people for their participation sometimes paying for their babysitters and only for their DNA.

Speaker 12 00:24:26.490
Then the counterargument is that once you do this you develop a vested interest group of people who perpetuate themselves. Yeah. Now I personally believe that this type of compensation for people dissipate the community work at some levels maybe not the salary you know desirable thing. Now to what extent in your programs at Ma do you have this type of possibility or to what extent have some of your staff people thought about this because the dilemma we are talking about is a very real one that is the so-called theorist on one hand and the activists and the community people and I don't want to put it on the other hand but as a part of the total mess.

Speaker 13 00:25:06.030
Well the formula has to include I think that in our society right now you play for pay and no matter what the game is. And if our research is going to involve the kinds of things I'm talking about then I'm going to have to compensate the people who are involved at all levels.

Speaker 10 00:25:25.230
I cannot give an answer about how to avoid. Therefore some of those people who are being paid in the community developing vested entrenched interests and therefore developing their own oligarchy. I don't have an answer to that.

Speaker 11 00:25:46.200
I think that the only answers I could give that would be suitable at all at this moment is that they are clichés quite frankly is that well you know the community people have to politicise themselves and learn how to hold each other accountable. You know that's language too but I think it's not an unreasonable language.

Speaker 13 00:26:05.010
But I don't have a formula I don't have any hard and fast rule to apply to that one. Well as we come toward the close of the programme you might add if I may that the same problem exists whether you talk about low income communities or middle income or what have you.

Speaker 5 00:26:22.140
That's the story of entrenched bureaucracies that story in the sense a story of organization. Yeah right and bureaucracies precisely. Did you have a say union leadership and all of a sudden they precisely saying I'm perpetuating our existence rather than the needs of the members.

Speaker 6 00:26:37.110
But you've focus very clearly tonight on these three areas what you call the three E's employment education and elections as areas that you are going to try to lead. Mock metropolitan applied research center in two. What are some of the things that you plan to do in order to develop this. The plan to seek new funding sources. Do you plan to use new approaches with your staff or are you going to let this evolve as a natural.

Speaker 13 00:27:07.300
No not. We're going to we're going to develop about four or five very specific projects with a beginning and ending points getting specific funding for them staffing up. Specifically we don't we won't develop a large permanent staff incidentally.

Speaker 11 00:27:25.890
These the staff I'm going to pull together will be staff that will relate to a specific project. We will get funding on the basis of these specific projects we develop and I because I don't want a long term 10 year thing.

Speaker 6 00:27:42.540
Then we become entrenched ourselves I think with that type of approach and that type of Vista. Mark is in good hands and the Mantle being passed from Ken Clarke to Chuck Hamilton will be well served. I'd like to thank our guest on tonight's soul of reason. Dr. Charles Hamilton the new president of the Metropolitan applied research center thanks for being with us tonight from Moscow.

Speaker 14 00:28:07.740
