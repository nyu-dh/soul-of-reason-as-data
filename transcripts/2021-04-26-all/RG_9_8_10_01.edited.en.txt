The 1975-76 theater and dance season is now beginning. As in the past few seasons Black theater will be the most exciting and innovative force on and off Broadway. Hear Peter, Bailey associate editor of Black Enterprise, discuss the coming year and Black Arts on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:41.441
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:08.770
Our guest on this evening's "Soul of Reason" is Peter Bailey who's Associate Editor of "Black Enterprise" magazine and is well-known for his work and writing in the arts and dance and drama. Glad to have you with us tonight Pete.

Peter Bailey 00:01:19.811
Thank you very much. I'm glad to be here.

00:01:21.551
Well, when the fall rolls around, the air gets a little bit crisp, and people begin to spend their money investing in theater and dance. They say, "The theater season is here!" And as we said at the top of the show Black theater and Black dance have been so exciting the past few years. Sometimes you wonder, "Can you top this?" Particularly after the success of "Wiz," and some of the things that happened in some of the neighborhood theaters. So what do you think the most exciting things that are happening in Black arts, theater, that art, drama, dance today.

Speaker 5 00:01:52.110
Well I think that there are several very very important and possibly very exciting events coming up in the Black theater world. The thing that I'm really looking forward to is seeing Linda Hopkins in her show, "Me and Bessie. I remember talking to Linda about a year or so ago when she was talking about getting the show together and how much, you know how much it -it- - how important- you know how important it was to her. And she also lives uptown and sings in a gospel church at 132nd street. And I went down to hear her one Sunday and she's -you know- she's fantastic. So I've been hearing reports coming from Los Angeles from people I know out there they say it is really really good. So I'm really looking forward to seeing that it's going to be called, "Me and Bessie" and it's opening up later this month. Also coming up on Broadway -- I think sometime this fall is a show called, "Bubbling Brown Sugar."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:45.220
Yeah I heard that they have been opening in Washington ...

Peter Bailey 00:02:48.381
Well, they were in Philadelphia where they got very very - drew big audiences. They ended up - now they're in Washington where I hear they also - they're still drawing big audiences and they're coming to New York to Broadway I think sometime in the latter part of the fall. This show's a kind of a musical review of Harlem, that was done by Lofton Mitchell. And I saw it when it was up - uptown ... not uptown but at 100 - on 86th Street at the AmaTheatre -the Am- done by the Amas Repertory Theatre which is headed by Rosetta LeNoire and it was pretty interesting then you know and I had some - it was a kind of loose and I assumed that they you know they've tightened it up some because, you know, it's been getting a lot of rave reviews but it's coming to New York in the fall. And I think that's going to be a big event when it comes in.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:31.501
And one thing about New York theater is that things can be a hit in Boston, in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington and sometimes not make it here.

Peter Bailey 00:03:41.721
Well, yeah, that's true ...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:42.701
That's one of - that's really one of the interesting problems, I don't know whether it's the fact that New York theater audience is so much more sophisticated or so much more demanding but you really don't know what's going to happen to a show until it really hits the boards in New York.

Speaker 5 00:03:56.080
Well I think that is true. I think it's because even among Black people here in New York and they really - up until recently- have not been very much of a theater audience. But you know the people demand more because they have they have a wide variety of choices. You know for many areas outside of New York City you know Black theater is still -you know- something different. You know in New York I mean you've got 17 functioning Black theater groups and you have the Black Theater Alliance, you know and you have play ... you can go see -you know- a different black play in New York at least every week or so-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:27.852
[Dr. Brown's voice overlaps] That's certainly true!-you know, you know if you so desire. And so as a result you know the people have become you know more demanding because they have a wider variety of choices. Outside of New York, whether - you know that you're kind of limited in new things you can go see the people are much more enthusiastic about seeing, you know, just seeing any Black production. Woody King said this, in fact. Woody said that if you want to make money -if a Black producer- -which Woody is- you know wants to make some money with his shows, he has to take them out of New York. He said because of the - he - well, he gives several various reasons and he said the union situation here in New York is a barrier against Black produced shows. And also the fact that the New York audience is a very, very difficult audience because they have so many - you know - a wide variety of choices. And I notice as you look at the rundown as provided by the Black Theater Alliance I think they have newsletter that comes out each month. You see that the number of Black plays they can look at range from some of the very older Black players to some of the newer more exciting and creative work....

Peter Bailey 00:05:25.931
[Mr. Bailey's voice overlaps]Oh yes, for instance...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:26.023
...And for a relatively small amount of money. So the competition for the Black theater audience is really very very tight. And then in the white theater audience unfortunately -at least I call it unfortunately- the type of plays that significant numbers of whites will pay big money to go to involving Blacks are very limited in range. So you end up mostly finding musicals, or else dramatic plays, that are not overly penetrating. For example I was really surprised that Doug Ward's most recent effort with NEC on Broadway, "The First Full Breeze of Summer" - "First Breeze of Summer" - didn't make it for a longer period of time but that was a really good play.

Peter Bailey 00:06:10.360
Yeah I thought that it was a good play too. But I really thought that when it came to Broadway, it came in one of Broadway's largest theaters and even - even solid white drama - has a difficult time surviving on Broadway these days.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:24.091
[Dr. Brown's voice overlaps] Oh, that's right! It did come to The Palace.

Peter Bailey 00:06:25.291
So, yes a huge theater you know and I mean there's just no way [amused] that - that a play, you know, that does not have, let's say some of the three, or four of the biggest names, you know, in the theatrical business will survive.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:37.000
[Dr. Brown's voice overlaps] And a cast - a cast of thousands ....

Peter Bailey 00:06:37.015
Right. You know in a theater that big I think I think they were trying to get on Broadway but I really think they should have even if they had the whole awful while they should have tried to come in in a smaller theater because like I say even you know the biggest wedding plays on Broadway. And both white theater and black theater basically musicals you know and drama is going to have a difficult time enough as it is so it really has to be well. Well stage an almost intimate in a sense yes it has to be a smaller theater. And I think that I found first breeze of summer you know a very interesting play. I don't I didn't I wasn't quite as overwhelmed by it. I think some of you know some of my friends were. But I did find a very interesting play. And it's one of the plays that I would recommend that people you know they might be on the road traveling and if it is that they are then I think people should you know should check it out. Now I also understand they're going to do it for any t so there'll be a television performance of it as well. Right. The black theater alliance for those in the audience who might be interested in getting on their mailing list is located at 15 for Broadway and the telephone number is 2 4 5 8 1 2 5. That's 2 4 5 8 1 2 5 4 the black theater alliance. And I'll be happy you can mentioned something about some of the other things that they do.

Speaker 7 00:07:54.120
Well you know the black theater alliance to me is one of the most solid organizations in the city. I would. Way back in 68 I was one of the people who always recommended a black theater groups get together you know and organize and try to form some kind of umbrella organization so they was you know when we couldn't each other's throats going after funds and things like that and they found me about three or four years ago formed a black theater Alliance and as a result I really think that it's because of the black theater alliance that many of the groups most of the groups survive these hard economic times. I think without that type of centralized thing where they worked together they would cooperate with each other that many more of the black theater goers might have gone by the wayside. But although most of them right now I must say the National Black Theater Barbara and tears boo Roddy Freeman's new heritage theater the Afro-American studio only Brooklyn talks you know all of these groups are basically still they might not be doing as many plays a year as they were doing before but they're still functioning they're still doing plays and if you want to find out about them you know you can do it through the black theater Alliance and the new thing is that the Black Sea the alliances now begin to incorporate dance groups for now. You can also find out what black dance groups who who basically some of the most exciting dance groups here in the city.

Speaker 5 00:09:00.310
You know Alvin Ailey is group George faith owns Diane MacIntyre sound in motion.

Speaker 7 00:09:07.650
Rod Rogers Fred Benjamin. I mean black choreographer is really into a lot of things here in New York. And if you want to find out about them you can also do it now through the through the black theater alliance talking about things that are coming up. I'm a member of the chairman of the awards committee of Delco Delco is an organization that was formed three years ago four years ago by bus by six black women to promote black theater and they've been doing a fantastic job and they have initiated an awards ceremony where we give out awards for excellence in black theater and this will be the third year this year it's going to be in November and we eventually hope to make this you know replace this will become the award that participants black theater we want to get you know we're going to replace the Tony and the OBE as the as the major objectives.

Speaker 8 00:09:52.870
We haven't started a war yet.

Speaker 7 00:09:54.630
No we haven't decided that yet but it's going to be in November you'll be seeing about you know in the papers and hearing about it on radio and I think people should come out because it's open to the public and it's on it's always on a Monday night which is when most of the theaters are closed all the performers you know can be there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:09.930
And this year we're really planning on making it into a big theme and it's called or Delco Idol cause it 929 Third Avenue you know here in New York City I think it's important that organizations like that get publicity and people begin to know about them because as you say at some point in time these awards might well replace the so-called more prestigious awards. And I think that when awards come from the basic culture they have a tendency to mean more. Are they going to be any major what we might call serious. I don't like to use that term because musicals can be serious as well but they're going to be any major serious plays on Broadway.

Speaker 7 00:10:51.390
Well you know unfortunately I haven't heard anything coming to Broadway. I have a listing of most all the plays that are due to open between now and January 1st.

Speaker 5 00:11:02.160
And the black things or me and Bessie with Linda Hopkins Bubbling Brown Sugar and I have a hard time pronouncements were trash trashy Mona. The the opera written by Scott Joplin.

Speaker 7 00:11:18.840
That's going to be opening up on Broadway but that's all if you want to see serious dramas you're going to have to go to the you know to the to the black community theaters who will be doing you know things of their type. I know Roger Friedman has a new play coming up at the new heritage theater. I don't know the name of it yet and I'm sure he was talking about you on a show sometime. I'm sure that that Ernie Maclean talk and you know Barbara and she and people like that also have some you know some serious things coming up. But if you really want to see some serious black drama serious you know Black plays you're going to have to go to the community theater. I think Woody King just did a version of cotillion on Jan Killen's book which ran for about four or five weekends down at his theater which was very well attended but they would say it was a drama. It was a comedy based on John Killen really know until you got into John. It was supposed to be a musical.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:06.050
Yeah they were planning on doing a musical book together but I understand I went down a couple of times tried to get in and buy some reason of grant or something they thought they had free admission. Well it's always free admission earlier. People were just standing in line and laughing and clapping and so on so I I may have a policy of free admission or is the play is well put together. Well let me ask you something about the movies. There is a I guess you'd call it an animated feature put together by bashing known as coon skin and it has gotten both negative and positive reviews and certainly create a certain amount of stir in the black community as being overly stereotypic and possibly even portraying black people as buffoons. On the other hand its proponents suggest that it has political significance and shows the decadence of America and so on. I know you have some opinions about this and I also know that you've talked to other people in the black autistic community. What does it seem to look like.

Speaker 9 00:13:12.850
Well coonskin to me. I put it into the same category as I put mandingo and Sheba baby and black Caesar and Superfly. It's it's then it's another Barsky to me is another white filmmaker who is who has found that black gold that goldmine would just become you in the black theater film going public. He's supposed to have made a very very you know the film is about supposed to be about America's brutality. I just did a review of the film for Mohammed speaks and in it in that I raise three major objections to it. My first objection is that I happen to be one of those people who who refused to give a white artist validity to do with the deal with black things until blacks have the right validity deal with white things. My second thing is is that if baskets film is about the brutality of America's racism then why is it called coonskin. We all know that coonskin is one of the coon is one of the derogatory terms used about blacks by whites. And my third thing is oh there's a lot of ambiguity in the film. You never know. The villains the so-called good guys come off just as bad in my opinion as the bad guys.

Speaker 10 00:14:24.370
I think those are some very valid criticisms.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:28.640
Having seen the film myself I was variously impressed and depressed by the way in which black people were portrayed. Allegedly one of the strong points is the use of so-called common average black language which sometimes I found even though it is our language sort of forced and the characterizations were fairly stereotypical. On the other hand particularly the preachers always trying to hustle somebody off a kind of business. On the other hand the portrayal of the role of the White underworld in dealing with black people the so-called delusion of America did come through. I guess the real question is the one that you asked earlier is to what extent can and should a white artist try to penetrate the entrails of the black community and projected in the arts and then the other thing is to what extent do we respond to that. Betsy Ruscoe my my position on that is that if the idea of a white artist is to awaken this country or to change his country's attitude then if they want to do something to talk let's say France is on drug addiction. The way to move America to do something about drugs is not to constantly every single time you do something go running to Harlem. The thing is to go out and get some of the little blond haired blue eyed drug heroin addicts and do a documentary on them. Then you might move America if you want to talk about the welfare you know and show about the welfare thing. Don't run to Harlem in Harlem across the country and always drag out a black family you know throw them up there you know show that welfare that the majority the overwhelming you are the welfare people in this country are white. As you know I call today's Village Voice now. They talk about the open admissions program in the minds of practically everybody in New York. The people benefiting from open admissions is a black and Puerto Ricans. In this article this guide documents that the overwhelming benefactors of the open most admissions in New York City are the Italian Americans and the Polish Americans. Why the white ethnic group you see and it's the same way would basking Barsky wants to show the brutality of what America is doing. Then why did he show you know go to Appalachia. Why is that. Why use all these exaggerated see black people we when we're not and we're in a very sensitive position in this country we're not. You know when you're part of the you know the majority you know you have a lot of leeway in things you can do when you're part of a minority you have to be very concerned about the images and everything that are put portrayed of you that you have no control over that are going to be going out to the world you know and I don't care what bash even changes overnight. And I still don't give him good intentions like some people say well you know his intentions were right. What I don't still give him that because like I said my position is if the if the aim of the film is to show the brutality of racism and what it has done then why is the film titled coon skin.

Speaker 8 00:17:29.420
Yeah. Because that's you know I think that's everybody's thing. Everybody knows that killing is one of the words I do after migratory terms that has been traditionally used names called by black people you know on black people you know by by many whites in allegedly the title was supposed to have been coonskin no more. But that's still derogatory. Why I mentioned it to white. Why why do you know this title.

Speaker 11 00:17:52.440
If this is the you know the objective of the film that the title really has nothing to do with me with the objective of the film which which of course makes me question you know what exactly would best use aims. Now I'm not you know and then my third thing you know I was talking about the you know the whole the lack of clarity the lack of clarity. Rabbit you know his position was you must drive the heroin pushers out of Harlem. I'm in complete agreement with that I've always believed that you know what we need is a black nationalist gangsters except you know that the heroin push in Harlem now also black.

Speaker 8 00:18:28.580
That's what they did to. But. But they they're still like like anything else they are they are not the ones they controlled you know.

Speaker 11 00:18:35.790
In fact they're the ones that they should be gone after first but they're not that you know they're not the ones who you know who would mean you know who the benefactors you know from the pushing here. But what I'm saying is that.

Speaker 12 00:18:49.490
But then he turns it around when he walk into this madam's house you know my man a rabbit you know is now taking the graph from the madam rather than die you know rent a cops. I mean there is really no clarity in what it's like. It's not really that rabbits aim. It's his aim to you know to to build a viable community. You know the hustle isn't just a hustle for himself. It turns out that that's what it turns out to be. And of course Barsky you know not being not being a part of the black community not living in Harlem he he I mean it really doesn't matter what Matt Rabbit's aims are you know cause he's he's he's gonna he's he's out there to make some cash and that's what he that's what I although I am happy to say that I don't think that the response to coonskin has been quite what they had thought he was going to be. And even after all the controversy about it they just knew then that they would make him demand make a bundle. But I went to the theater and it was about three fourths empty. Right. I did too. When I went to see it on a Friday evening that would do what I sat through that were about look like about about 50 people in the whole audience. And then when I left the audience that was replacing that audience I stayed behind you know to see them and there were only about maybe 100 people in the theater I went. I don't see why raking in the money again. You know it shows me that that eventually black folks good states come to the forefront you know and. And you know to deal with these kind of things. Yeah we certainly would hope so. Cause you raise an interesting dilemma. And maybe it isn't a dilemma a question as to whether the role of artist provide a message to provide entertainment or to make money or do both. And we have seen this whole range of exploitation films which you made a lot of money or a lot of people. Some black but mostly white. We also have this described and discussed the fact that most of these films have made very little difference in terms of people's understanding of the truisms and the imperatives in the black community. So then when you say if his purpose was to enlighten or to challenge I tend to feel that in most instances the purpose of people who produce films is to make money and not just to break even to make money.

Speaker 10 00:21:07.380
So therefore many of the message bearing aspects of film tend to be sublimated to the profit bearing aspects of film. Well I would say I was I only I brought that up only because this has been one of the one of the positions of Baskin's defenders and of Barsky himself. I happen to feel that he was out to make money I brought it the whole fact of the aims and objective because this is this has been one of you know this is what they've been pushing you know that he's different than than the guy who made Superfly or the man who make Mandingo or the man who makes sheep a baby you know that he was trying to do something you know political with his film. And when you read the reviews you know you you this is what you get. So that's the only reason I even brought it up because I happen to be the man as I get to make some cash you know and and that is. Oh that's what he did on his first two films and unfortunately I don't think he's going to make quite that much. You know on this one.

Speaker 13 00:21:58.240
But that's the only reason I brought that up. But I must I want to add one thing. I don't think and I said this in the review from Mohammed speaks I do not I do not believe the white filmmakers who are making these films I'd simply do not. Black people are responsible for these films. I have I have yet to see a single white film maker with a pistol on any black man's head telling him to go downtown and put four dollars down to see those movies so as far as I am concerned they are doing what comes natural in the society in which we live. Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:38.990
Not to make money in that sense you're right. However if we go back to 68 where the so-called black film explosion began as you recall too vividly really there were practically no black faces in the films. Very little about black people. And I guess every ethnic group likes to see some representation of himself in the media and some of the films I mean some of them I think were somewhat creative although maybe we not always agree on the content of them sweet sweetback for example had some creative aspects of it all. You might not particularly like some of the content some of the black films like Gordon Parks Learning Tree you really had some stories to them but did not have the pizzazz that really gets the film over so that when a shaft and a Superfly hit black people identify. No I personally don't particularly agree with what they identify with but I think there is some understanding of why black people flock now. The next step is having flopped and having shown Hollywood that yes you can make a buck by making fixes about black people then I think black people need to demand more from the industry need to demand more from the old black filmmakers.

Speaker 9 00:23:55.870
Well I I'm not saying I'm even back in 68. I agree with you that you know something new. But surely that is not the case. You know feel up in 1975 we can be a again fortunately I think that black people's inherent good sense is coming through because those films are not making the money that they used to make. Let's talk about their inherent good sense. I think the inherent good sense is partially a function of people like Peter Bailey and people who write about black art and attempt to interpret it to the black community. And I know through your work with Black Enterprise you have some ideas in mind that will do just this. Could you tell us about some of those. You're one of the things that I hope you do at Black Enterprise on the cultural level is to is to to write about you know films and plays in these kind of things. Traditionally you know you write it you deal with them strictly in the aesthetic sense. But but with met with Black Enterprise being a business magazine. It will provide an opportunity to discuss the business of culture. You see black folks never think of culture in terms of money. And I read an article in The New York Times about six months ago who said that in the previous year culture in New York City alone was a three billion dollar a year industry. Now that is a lot of money. So I oh let's say for instance if I'm going to do an article on The Wiz for Black Enterprise I will not just talk about how good it is how great the acting is. I want to know who put the money up. How much money is being made. How much how much that money is going to perform performers you know all those things that go into the business of putting together a Broadway show. And that's what I'll be doing. You know when you cover anything you do cover a major film. You discuss the film and from its economic aspects as well as its aesthetic and I will you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:39.980
Because Black Enterprise is a prestigious and well-known magazine basically focusing on black business although they have had articles on it which have political implications and articles on education and so on. Will you in addition to focusing on the economics I imagine do one on the record industry and that Black Enterprise has done two or three articles on that in the past but I'm sure you probe some other areas on theater on the publishing industry will you also have a column in Black Enterprise which evaluates or criticizes.

Speaker 8 00:26:19.020
Right. Well I know you liked it. Well I I really I really don't know about that.

Speaker 14 00:26:23.660
You know you can bet that I'm going to be constantly you know maneuvering and trying to get you know this type of thing into the magazine. But you know I'm just you know I mean I'm an associate editor there. You know I don't really decide you know what would exact what exact things they do. I think that that Black Enterprise is audience type of audience that would really be interested in such a you know in such a you know an evaluation you know of films. I know one of the things that I'm trying to do personally is that I wrote to 65 black newspapers across the country and I'm trying to get and I'm trying to get them to let me do a syndicated theater column from New York and which I will send out to them on a monthly basis. You know in covering you know what's happening you know in theater in New York because of theater that starts here you know gets out into the rest of the country you know and I'll do fishing just tell what plays on the road coming on the role what plays are running in New York places to eat in the theater district evaluate plays you know do profiles and theater personalities. And right now I'm waiting I'd send a letter out about almost three weeks ago and I'm kind of waiting to hear from the newspapers that if I could just get five or 10 of them out of the 65 to to reply positively I'm going to start doing this column.

Speaker 10 00:27:38.060
I think that's an excellent idea because that really is the way in which you develop this enlightened audience and talking about this enlightened audience. Does your audience also include the television audience because we know that some of the same things that have happened in the films have happened in television you have a whole range of black shows some of which might be more penetrating than others but the general range of black shows probably is much better than the general a range of white shows on television and television.

Speaker 14 00:28:04.460
You know situate situation comedy is the thing you know and what you're going to get. You know what you're getting of the black situation comedies and I don't really see anything more than that developing unless black people you know start you know raising hell and demanding you know some different type of television presentations you know because once again you know that's true and a general television situation comedy is the thing about CBS that they had for right in a row on Monday night.

Speaker 10 00:28:34.970
Of course what you're really saying is what you've been saying throughout the interview and now namely black people and the black theater going audience need to be aware and familiar with what's happening in theater. Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been Peter Bailey associate editor of Black Enterprise talking about new developments in black arts.

Speaker 15 00:28:56.630
You've been listening to soul of reason with your host the director of the Institute of Art for one African affairs at New York University Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior and featuring a distinguished guest voicing the black experience. Soul of reason is produced by BW NBC public affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University. Please join us again next week.
