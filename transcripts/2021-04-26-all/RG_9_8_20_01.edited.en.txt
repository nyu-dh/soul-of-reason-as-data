Black films have shown Black people in many "Soul of Reason" roles: crusader, hero, sex symbol, revolutionary, comic. What does it all mean? Hear Cliff Frazier of Third World Cinema discuss trends in Black filmmaking on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:38.690
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:05.570
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Cliff Frazier who is Administrator of Third World Cinema which is a Black filmmaking organization and media organization doing great things in the world of film and media. Glad to have you with us tonight, Cliff.

Cliff Frazier 00:01:18.921
Thank you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:20.301
Well we're talking about Black films and, as we indicated at the top of the show, Black films have shown Black people in many, many different roles. We've had comic films, we've had mystery films, we've had "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" films and we've had "Shaft" and "Superman" and "Superfly." And as I said, we want to know what does it all mean. And I know that Third World Cinema is trying to do some significant things in this area. And after we analyze what it means, we'll talk about some of the things that you're doing.

Cliff Frazier 00:01:54.260
OK. You know one of the things that's rather interesting in looking at Variety magazine, which is one of the bibles of the motion picture, theater, and allied media industries, we see and have seen over the past two months that "Let's Do It Again," a comedy, and "Mahogany". ..

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:19.053
An escape film--a Black Loretta Young film, I call it.

Cliff Frazier 00:02:23.301
Whatever you call it, have been leading the charts in cash receipts for a long, long period of time. So it sort of indicates that there's a healthy, willing to spend Black audience desirous of seeing images that reflect, to some extent, Black images. In some instances, those reflections are not as positive as they might be. They're not as informational as they might be. They're not as motivational as they might be. But nevertheless they're there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:57.290
Well don't you think that "Mahogany" has appealed to the white audience as much as it has to the Black audience or is "Mahogany" mainly seen by Black people? As I've seen people line up, I think I've seen a more integrated audience there than I have at "Let's Do It Again."

Cliff Frazier 00:03:13.251
Yeah. Well, Diana Ross was popular with Black buyers of her records as well as the white buyers, as well. To an extent, to some extent an effort has been made to make Billy Dee Williams the quote "Black Clark Gable." And if you'll notice, we use associations and images that, again, tend to suggest that white folks imitating Black folks. ..

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:41.000
Black folks imitating white folks.

Cliff Frazier 00:03:41.006
I mean, Black folks imitating white folks. Diana Ross is compared with Doris Day, you know, Loretta Young. Billy Dee Williams is compared with Clark Gable. And I think those comparisons suggest that this type of film and this theme of a film should be acceptable to a white audience. On the other hand, I haven't heard those comparisons with "Let's Do It Again." There are other films though, rather escapist, exaggerations of reality, pseudo imitations of ridiculous things like "Friday Foster"-- to some extent the "Shaft" experience--bit off a bit of that. There was a willing Black audience prepared to buy the tickets to go see it. And of course, one of the reasons is that when you have very little to choose from, you will choose to spend to see that which you are somewhat able to identify with, regardless to how ridiculous and exaggerated the theme might be.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:46.670
And then of course there is the other thing and that is that as Black folks we expect a lot from the arts. We expect a lot from our theater, from our dance, from our music, and now from our films. And yet the history of filmmaking, in America at least, is that films basically have been escapist oriented. They have not really been message oriented. They present a covert message in terms of the images that people play, the roles that we play, the way they show life. But in terms of the core content of most American films, they really don't say much in a very deep sense about society. So that when we as Black people demand that our films give messages, we are really swimming up tide against what the media, the film business has been telling us. Probably the most significant thing is that we are asking for--rather than messages-- images, and in a sense we have gotten away from Stepin Fetchit and Rochester. We are no longer just a butler, or the shuffling Sam. We do become a hero. We do become a villain. We do become a detective. And in a sense that is positive, and I think that's what Black people were looking for in part. Myself, I'm interested in messages. I'm interested in looking at the society. I'm interested in not necessarily the whole society, but slices of the society. That's why I guess I find films like you found because that's one probably everyone should recognize. It has not so much a message, but it gives a more detailed slice of society. I think Gordon Parks new film "Leadbelly" will do the same thing. It looks intensely at a particular slice of Black life rather than the panoply of cops and robbers and sex symbols running up and down and crashing cars into the wall.

Cliff Frazier 00:06:43.350
Yeah. One problem that the filmmaker confronts, though, is that hundreds of thousands of dollars are usually spent to make a film. Sometimes. ..

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:52.083
That's a good point. You ought to reiterate that.

Cliff Frazier 00:06:54.160
Yes a big chunk of money is spent. Many. .. the average Black film costs probably eight hundred thousand to a million dollars. The rule of thumb is that in order to make a profit you have to make at least two and a half times what you've paid to make the film. That also is a big chunk of money. And once you realize the. .. your nut, which is at two and a half, then you begin to to walk in the gravy. But all of us want to walk in the gravy. Now the Black filmmakers who are emerging and who wish to participate more meaningfully in the industry have great difficulty getting this kind of money.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:37.860
You have difficulty getting the upfront money the eight hundred thousand and a million, and I imagine even if you are able to put a package together you have difficulty retaining enough of a share of control.

Cliff Frazier 00:07:49.750
I mean the complexity of the film industry is much greater than what might appear. First of all, you gotta find the money. Once you find the money, you gotta make the film. Once you've made the film, you've got to put it in the marketplace for some kind of public consumption. Now, at all of these turns there's a possibility of you being discouraged, turned around, and even defeated. Raising the money is a big problem. Usually, even with the Black films and the Black themes, it's the whites who can go out and raise the money because they have greater access to the lenders in the marketplace.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:25.801
That's right because basically it's not hundred dollar lenders.

Cliff Frazier 00:08:28.381
That's what we're talking about. They want some security, or they give the impression that they want some security. And let's keep in mind also that efforts are usually made to discourage Black participation in a money-making situation, be it films, be it television, be it the record industry, be it whatever it is. Whites choose to maintain as much control of these industries as they possibly can, and they will put pitfalls and roadblocks in your path at every turn--every time they can.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:01.080
And part of that, of course, is that much of the money that has gone into this comes from the moneyed establishments, the banks. ..

Cliff Frazier 00:09:08.730
Oh yeah. Oh of course.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:09.483
And people who have discretionary money to spend, and particularly when you know let's say a white banker's dealing with another broker or what have you. They've done business before they have a certain amount of built up confidence. Then when a Black comes into the scene, regardless of his credentials, there is a certain amount of hesitancy--which in part is natural and is part racism-- to say well look can we really trust this person, can we really. ..

Cliff Frazier 00:09:36.801
That's usually an excuse.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:38.220
Of course it is an excuse. But what I was developing is that the the climate within which this takes place is a climate of risk. I think we should all know the film business is a high risk business. I mean not every film, not even most films makes. ..

Cliff Frazier 00:09:49.600
The rewards, though, can be very, very great. Claudine, which was Third World Cinema's first film, enjoyed immense financial and critical success. And it's put Third World in a position to be able to deal in the marketplace, to be able to get some measure of financial credibility and dignified responses from those moneylenders. So we hope that in months to come Third World will begin to accelerate its processes more quickly and put in motion two or three films almost simultaneously.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:29.910
Well, could you tell us a little about Third World? How its organized. What's its basic constituency, and what is its basic purpose?

Cliff Frazier 00:10:38.601
Third World is a minority controlled film production company. I should say a media production company, because Third World is not going to limit itself to motion picture production. In future months it will be involved in television productions. It will move even to some extent into the advertising industry, to begin to develop commercials, to hopefully play some kind of significant role in influencing the stories, the images you see, the control of those stories that are being told, to also represent an area of employment for emerging Black professionals--Black and Hispanic professionals.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:20.840
If I recall correctly, at one time Third World was doing some training, and some workshops. ..

Cliff Frazier 00:11:24.050
It still is. In fact, I administer that training program, and Third World has moved even into the unions approximately 75 people in various skills. But it doesn't just confine itself to motion picture production. It's also interested in quite a number of other areas. I said before we're concerned with television, making sure that a number of people function meaningfully in the television industry. In fact, one of our earlier graduates we were able to place at NBC TV.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:59.662
Maybe you can show that the audience who is not particularly familiar with this can become aware of it--there's a whole range, a myriad of behind the scenes jobs in television and in filmmaking generally. You see the actor, you see the announcer, and that's what most people identify.

Cliff Frazier 00:12:16.850
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:18.830
But behind it, it's the lighting, and it's the audio person, and it's the sound coordinator. ..

Cliff Frazier 00:12:25.373
Absolutely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:25.375
And the mixer, and the stagehand, and a production assistant, a production supervisor, an electrician, and you name it. It must be at least 20 unions that are involved in just producing one television program.

Cliff Frazier 00:12:37.371
There are quite a number of unions, and they have within those unions various locals that control certain disciplines within the broadcasting industry.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:45.950
And how does one get in those?

Cliff Frazier 00:12:47.361
With difficulty. You have to be either in someone's family, a station must be under pressure for a license renewal and prepared to respond more favorably to a minority effort to get in. One thing that really dismayed me a great deal, I was doing a show in California, a TV show, and there were a lot of us who were on the camera personnel, and we were doing our number. And I looked around and all the technicians were white. Now, I knew this show had a limited run, and eventually those Blacks would no longer be working in front of the camera. However, those technicians, who were making as much or more than the personalities, their jobs would continue. And because of that, I began to think that it would become very important for me to make an effort to try to bring more minorities in that behind the scenes area so that not only we could find meaningful employment, but to build a stronger economic base for Black people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:46.701
And of course, that's really what Third World Cinema is about, as you say. In addition to being a production organization, in many areas of media it is also a training organization. And if anything, if Black film, the new genre of Black films will do, hopefully it will be through the leadership of folks like Third World, to help us develop meaningful and realistic images of Black people. Now in doing this, Cliff, through your training program, what kind of jobs do you train people for? How do people get in touch with this? And how many people have you trained over the past few years?

Cliff Frazier 00:14:24.310
OK. We take the position that it's vitally important to have minority inclusion into a wide variety of areas that relate to the mass media, not just motion picture production. There are only X number of jobs in the motion picture industry. We try to relate to broadcasting, public relations, sales, distribution, advertising, anything that relates to communicating a message, be it visually, be it through sound, be it through the printed word, et cetera. Third World Cinema is located at 62 West Forty Fifth--telephone number is 972-9300. Over the past I would think three, two and a half to three years, we've been responsible for moving approximately 300 people into these allied media industries, some as producers, some as production managers, some as camera operators, sound recorders, public relations specialists, et cetera. And we feel that it's in these areas that we can not only make some kind of significant impact as far as affecting and influencing the spoken or communicated word, but also it could represent significant and continuing employment for those participants rather than having people work for a week and then be unemployed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:49.020
All right now what specifically, if let's say a person in the audience wants to be trained in some area of media and they call your number, 972-9300, and say, "Well look, I want to come in and register for one of these training programs." Now what specific training programs do you have? How are they funded? How much do they cost and so on?

Cliff Frazier 00:16:12.460
Okay. The persons would call us at the number that was given. And they would be asked to come in to discuss what their real interests are. So a lot of people are wrapped up with what is considered the glamour of the industry. So we try to break that down.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:27.903
The on air personality. On camera.

Cliff Frazier 00:16:29.520
Or thinking even behind the scenes is glamorous, when a lot of it is a lot of hard, at times dirty work. So we try to wipe away the glamour of it and bring it down to its nuts and bolts. You'd be surprised how many people get discouraged because of that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:46.721
Decide that's not for them, right?

Cliff Frazier 00:16:48.633
So the intent is to treat it realistically.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:52.350
And once we've conveyed that, we have them fill out the applications we have and we try to determine what is their specific area of interest. If in the future we have an opening that relates to that--and we've delved into public relations, we've delved into advertising, motion picture projectionist, camera, etc.-- if we have an opening in the future that relate to their interests, even graphic arts, they will be notified to come in to be interviewed for that specific one. We will then make a determination from those persons interviewed which ones we think will best be able to function in that given discipline. And then we'll put the person in for a six month period of training, usually six months to a year. Now how is it funded. Is this something that people have to pay for?

Cliff Frazier 00:17:51.111
No, no. This is free. This is free.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:51.840
Is it funded by federal agencies or state agencies or what?

Cliff Frazier 00:17:54.810
It's funded at present by the New York City. And we hope to move it over to the federal government sometime in the in the coming months, which has at this time more financial stability. We have enjoyed tremendous success. I think we might be considered one of the favorite programs because of this high record of accomplishment. Not only has Third World been interested in moving people into the industry through training, but we also try to identify people who already have skills, who are professionals and out of work. And if we hear of a job that relate to their skills we'll call them. As a young man most recently I sent a letter out for, for a producers position here at NBC. And I think that he very well might get that. He's a highly qualified very capable individual. We're concerned about our folks working: those who don't have skills how can they get skills, those who do have skills how can they get a job after being laid off, fired, etc., and move them into some kind of meaningful position. See one of the things that--I recently finished a pilot for a series for one of the other stations, and if this goes as a series there'll be approximately 16 ,17 shows. You'll hire approximately 20, 30, or 40 people for each show. If you take the lowest figure 20, and multiply that by 17, that gives you some idea as to the number of jobs that any producer of a series controls.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:30.901
Now would you clarify for the audience what a producer is as differentiated from a director or from a writer.

Cliff Frazier 00:19:39.610
OK. The producer is the one who puts all the component parts together that result in the finished product. He's the one or she's the one who's responsible for identifying the writer, or if it's an already written piece of material, getting the money and assembling the people necessary to make the film a reality. He hires the actors, he hires the director, he hires its production manager. With the production manager and the director's assistance they hire the crew, they hire the cast. The producer is the one who controls the entire thing. That person is the one who's responsible for moving people into positions of employment. Through the years, the producers have been white. Most of the Black films have had white producers. Now if sincerity had been involved on the part of most of those producers to move Black people into key positions within these various industries and into those unions, a number of Blacks could have gone in, because that producer controls the number of jobs. If you tell a union, "I want to use that particular cameraman," how can they prevent you from hiring that person. They can say well he isn't a union member. Well make him one.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:55.141
Well make him a union member. Right.

Cliff Frazier 00:20:55.148
How can they prevent this man from working? Because this man has the skill that you need to produce the film you want. That's how whites have got in through the years. That's how the father and son thing has continued to exist. In most cases you'll find a producer when he produces a film or she produces a film, they will have some member of their family connected with that film, as well, because that person is in a position to control the job flow. Now you can't just be grandiose and be idealistic and bring in someone who can't do the job. You got to have people who can function. There are a lot of Black and Puerto Rican folks out here who have skills who should be moved either into the key positions or into positions that are a little below the key positions so they can acquire the necessary skills to move up that other rung-- because realistically man, if white producers are making white films they will not likely call on Black folks to work. So with all of these Black films being made, it is crucially important that future producers be they Black or white give serious attention to bringing Black and Puerto Rican folks into meaningful positions. The film we shot for the other station was shot in Harlem. I had one hundred percent minority crew, actors. We even went to the various eating establishments uptown, went to one of the bars and said look to the sister who was operating the kitchen, and said, "Can you cook enough food for 30 people?" Went there three and four times. Went to one of the Muslim restaurants and arranged to have the cast fed, the cast and crew fed there three or four times. We recycled whatever moneys were available for this production within that community. We used Blacks who had equipment and rented their equipment rather than going to the equipment rental houses, just again to not only give them the money and enable them to continue to function as professionals, but to encourage that concept of recycling the moneys within your community so you build a stronger base within that community. It relates to some extent with the philosophy that the Nation of Islam had years ago when they were buying from the Islamic bakeries, buying from the Islam supermarkets and recycling the money. So the moneys you make outside in that white environment, be it working for the bank, be it working for the clothing store, et cetera, et cetera. You take some of that money and you bring it back into your communities. This is what Jews have done through the years. You bring it back to your community and you spend that money with that Black merchant. You spend that money with that person who owns that Black eating established, so that they get economically stronger. They are able to hire more people and the process of recycling that money within builds a stronger community so that you in turn can wind up by depositing your money perhaps locally. And if it isn't a Black controlled bank then certainly as a Black community you can influence what that bank does. You can use the moneys that have been put in by Blacks to help refurbish, to help repair, to help build a stronger and more solid community. And all of this interrelates. The media industry interrelates with that concept. All industries can interrelate with it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:23.160
Now when you get into doing this, let's say through Third World Cinema, and say the film you just shot, to what extent does it slow your process down when you have to go and dig out these people, and dig out this equipment, and find these people. Because certainly I think most Black people would agree 100 percent with the basic philosophy. On the other hand, the media business is a time bound business. You've got to meet deadlines. How do you go about this? Because I know that this is a problem all of us who are in the media face.

Cliff Frazier 00:24:59.010
OK. I've had an advantage in that for the past eight years I've been involved in developing talent for the media. Prior to Third World, I was doing it with Community Film Workshop Council. At that time, we must have found and trained approximately a thousand people for jobs around the country as broadcast journalists, as on the air reporters, as cameramen, light, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We established film based workshops around the country, again using that center as a nucleus through which to train people for various skills in the industry. Now we're talking about eight years ago. If some of those folks have been working intermittently for that past eight years, they are gaining skills. I know enough people to not have to search for any great length of time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:49.560
Unfortunately, we don't have enough Cliff Fraziers. And I read a statistic the other day, based on a study done by the National Council of Churches, that the number of Blacks in the media are actually decreasing, which does raise a sort of problem. It's true that some people retire and get sick and die or what have you. But basically we're training more people yet the opportunities are tightening up. What can we do about that?

Cliff Frazier 00:26:11.820
Well, we must continue to press forward. We must continue to interrelate with groups like Black Citizens for a Fair Media, that's constantly making an effort to open up a number of jobs for minorities. See, one of the things that has happened, they've lumped women together with minorities and say, "Look here's our statistic. Here are our figures, and we have a Black," when you count it twice, you know, as the various broadcasting companies make their reports to the Federal Communications Commission. So you have all of these as problems. But in spite of all of that, those people who are determined enough, those people who lay in there enough, who stay with it enough, who are persistent, who continue and continue and continue, in many instances those people eventually reach pay dirt. But we are discouraged so quickly, and that is often what results in not penetrating that barrier. And hey man, as long as I'm out here, as long as I'm doing anything that's media related, you can rest assured that a lot of the people working with it are gonna be my brothers and sisters.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:14.131
Of course, one of the purposes of shows like "Soul of Reason" is to help the world at large, the Black world, the white world, to know about what opportunities there are for Blacks and develop this desire which all Black people have in terms of the desire. But to reinforce this idea of coming back and keep on trying and getting those skills, I think the key point that you've developed throughout our interview tonight has been the idea that you need to have those skills, and even though there might be some barriers that are holding you back, that you've got to really keep on moving ahead. And I think Third World Cinema tries to do that kind of thing. Again, could you give our audience the address and the telephone number in case anyone wants to contact your organization?

Cliff Frazier 00:28:02.451
Okay. We're at 62 West Forty Fifth, and the telephone number is 972-9300.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:09.001
And that's Third World Cinema, which is doing a fantastic job in the area of developing Black films, analyzing themes, and developing personnel for the film industry and the media industry. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Cliff Frazier, Administrator from Third World Cinema, and we've been talking about the developments in Black films and the role of Blacks in the media industry.
