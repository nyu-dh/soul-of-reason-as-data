Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:22.420
This is "Soul of Reason." A program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:49.001
The pioneer spirit is flourishing in New York City. Over two dozen nonprofit urban development corporations are reconstructing homes in the inner city. Tonight we will meet David Robinson of United Harlem Growth Incorporated. To discuss this important phenomenon. And David we're glad to have you with us tonight.

David Robinson 00:01:07.331
It's a pleasure to be with you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:09.081
Now this is really--very exciting development. I use the term urban homesteading to describe it and it sort of parallels what happened in the pioneer days when the westward movement--when people would go out and stake out a piece of land and develop their homes and so on. Could you tell us what your company--your corporation--nonprofit corporation United Harlem Growth is trying to do and relate that to the general development in this whole area of urban homesteading?

David Robinson 00:01:36.970
Well, I think the basic intent of United Harlem Growth is to ensure the survival of its membership and to try to work through and develop a system and structure of dealing with community development which ensures the survival and continued existence and growth of people within the Harlem community primarily, though it though translates to any low income community in New York or the country. And survival as it relates to being able to provide for oneself and one's family a decent, safe home which will then foster the growth and everything else that comes with home and family. But survival is really the most overwhelming motivation and it's probably been the only factor that--which would have sustained us over over the years that it has taken us to develop and get to the point now where we're actually in to--close to fifty percent completion on the construction of this first project.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:57.220
Now as I understand it, urban homesteading begins with a piece of property that the city has taken over because of nonpayment of taxes, what have you. And they make it available at a very, very low cost to a group of people who will agree to construct their own home on the site. Now, what is the approximate cost--is it a dollar or is it $10,000 or what?

David Robinson 00:03:19.060
There was a there was an existing formula that the Department of Real Estate had which was $100 per unoccupied unit and I believe the feeling of the city was that-- that here was abandoned property that was generating no taxes, and if they could get rid of it for any amount of money and then have the tax income that the city would, in the long run, be better off. There's something that is afoot now in the Department of Real Estate where the city and in its search to find more money is looking at these properties as a potential source of income based on sale. And it--it seems to be unfortunate--there seems to be a more short-sighted view of the survival of the city because you--you really don't have a great deal in terms of the value of the property because you're talking about property that's been abandoned for as long as ten years. And really it becomes prohibitive if the acquisition cost is too high to the large number of people. But the city does have a number of units and divisions within the Department of Real Estate and the Housing and Development Administration which allows nonprofit community groups to negotiate with the city to acquire city-owned property within their community. And there is a glut of it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:42.192
Knowing that, in your particular case, the United Harlem Growth Corporation, how many units as it were, are you working on constructing at this time?

David Robinson 00:04:51.580
We are doing eleven units and we're doing large units. We're doing units that have the family in mind, are--the members of the corporation are family people and we're looking at a situation which is a base for a long range operation within the city. So we are giving ourselves adequate space to--for both the physical and spiritual survival and growth of the people who live there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:26.511
And how many people are in your cooperation?

David Robinson 00:05:29.100
There are some fifteen families represented as well as a half dozen or more tradesmen who work with us.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:38.871
Now in developing this, I gather that there's a lot of work to be done right from the ground up, as it were, and different people assume different responsibilities. Now is this based on any previous expertise they've had or is there OJT--on-the-job training?

David Robinson 00:05:56.850
Oh, there is--every member of the corporation is--no member of the corporation has confronted anything in the size that we are doing now. None of us have functioned in these capacities before. We--some of us came with a varied degree of experience. I had a little real estate and construction background, but we are all functioning in an OJT situation. And probably the--not the greatest, but an equal amount of learning that had to be done was actually studying the dynamics of the problem to figure out exactly what we are up against, you know, to--in order to determine what it is we're gonna do. We spent--my partner, Mr. David White and I spent--and a number, all the members of the corporation spent--the first eight months to a year and a half trying to understand what it was we were dealing with. And at the time we were studying the question of what to do with poor people in the city was one that was in the papers a lot but--and we--the newspapers and a certain number of periodicals and books were our primary source of information. With all the questions that there were, and all the minds that there were talking about it, answers were not to be found. I mean, there were no satisfactory answers coming out as to what was going to happen to poor people in the city and what the city was planning to do with poor people. And to this day I don't hear any master plan which includes the survival of poor folk.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:33.901
And one of the things you come up with is that if you can get some of these buildings and reconstruct them and become involved in the actual process, not only do you get a place for survival but it also develops an ethos that can spill over into the surrounding community. Which suggests that you have a very creative way of looking at the issue of the survival of poor folk. You had said prior to coming on the air that you've also built into your construction plan some federal--a manpower-type training where as people become involved in constructing their own homes, they gain a skill which then they can go out into the occupational market and sell and make a living from it.

David Robinson 00:08:16.620
Yeah. One of the things that we realized as we got into dealing with the issue was that not only was it necessary to create housing at a cost that we could afford to live in but we also had to have a skill to bring in an income to sustain that house. And in a Harlem community where one of the statistics--you have fifty percent of the people who are trained for jobs that no longer exist, you have forty nine percent of the youth, according to The New York Times, who have virtually no future in terms of skills or jobs. We understood the necessity of training ourselves to be able to bring income to our families and also have some productive skill to work in the community with. In August of this year, United Harlem Growth will be moving into areas of contracting which--where the training that we've had in this past year will be utilized so that the membership of the corporation will stay with the corporation and go on in terms of employment and community development within this nucleus of people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:40.440
Tell us a little something about some of the backgrounds of some of the people who are in this corporation, because it is a very unique idea and it must take some very unique people to stick with it. Give us a little background about some of the people.

David Robinson 00:09:52.831
The dynamics of the corporation are really extremely good. We have, we--I think believe we started out with a core of five families. And the dynamics--everyone in the corporation has a demonstrated history of commitment trying to find the vehicle through which to benefit the community and self. All have worked--people have worked from Operation Push to the Panthers to Urban League to whatever. We have a brother who was with the New York City housing police, brother Luther Gales, and he was the first brother who raised the issue of beards within the housing police. So we have a lot of--there's a lot of individual strength within the corporate members and a lot of brothers who had been thinking independently long prior to our hooking up. And really as we began to hook up it was a tremendous feeling of at least--alright, now we're beginning to hook up with some people who are moving in the same direction. And there was some real strength just generated out of that. But there's a long history of association with the people--our relationships go back some--some of our members grew up together. Ninety nine percent of our members were born and raised in Harlem. And a hundred percent of us are in the lower--I don't know what percent a lot--percentile of the economic, but we're all--everyone is struggling.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:43.330
You're all struggling. All right, now we've gotten your corporation together. Could you take us a little bit step by step--what do you do? This building is available and you have to make this arrangement with the city. After that's done, what do you do in terms of getting it constructed? Do you have to clear it out, or do you--take over from there.

David Robinson 00:12:02.590
Yeah, you--once you have your acquisition package or your purchase of the building is tied in with your financing of what it is that you intend to do. And once you have at least structured your financing on paper you are able to negotiate your acquisition. Once you've acquired the buildings then you are into setting up an ongoing--excuse me--construction operation which involves a total demolition. These buildings were abandoned, some for seven years. A tremendous amount of water damage. It's unfortunate that with the buildings--some buildings become abandoned and are not in such bad structural shape. But the situation is that they are left there for a number of years and by the time anybody gets into them, you're talking about a gut job. So in some of our buildings we've replaced as much as eighty percent of the beams--the floor joists. So really you can be--have nothing but a brick structure to start with. So you have a long period of demolition which is a tremendous operation--beautiful--because it's all unskilled work and folk loved--it's hard work--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:12.811
You pull things apart--

David Robinson 00:13:12.813
Yeah, you know--it's sledgehammer work, and for people who have been, you know frustrated and ready to go, that is the best operation along as it being very cohesive, because you're working very hard with a group of brothers and, you know, once you've come through that experience it's really much--the rest of the work is much easier because you're dealing with a clean building and level floors and whatnot.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:37.931
By the way, is there any economic fallout from this? Can you sell any of the stuff that you--

David Robinson 00:13:42.091
You can sell your scrap metals, I guess. We don't so much sell--we benefit from the demolition that goes on in other areas because we're able to salvage beams, we're able to salvage angle irons--you know, there's no economic consideration to demolition, you know, and so they just tear down stuff and we've been able to cut costs moderately by salvaging.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:10.660
All right, now after you've demolished and then you begin, who does your architectural work--or do you have to have an architect?

David Robinson 00:14:15.940
You must have an architect, it is key to--in terms of what you are building. You need a professional structure. One of the things that is extremely frustrating is that people coming from a community level saying, listen we gonna--we are dying out here. Now, there's a need to survive, and going in very emotionally, you get kicked in the tail because there's no emotionalism about real estate development. You need a professional team in terms of your architectural component. You need to be sharp in terms of your construction management and you need to have the financial capability to carry it out, you know, because there are--as we talked about, two dozen groups who are existing within--working within--in New York. There are three times that many who would like to but don't have the group dynamics or the finances to carry it out. And then of those two dozen there are half of those who are not working because of financial difficulties. So it's--the dynamics have to be precise in order to get over.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:26.380
Now in your case, is one of your members an architect, or do actually have to go out and buy, or get volunteer architectural help?

David Robinson 00:15:33.600
You can work on spec--speculation with an architect--speculating that if the job comes through and the mortgage closes he will get his payment out of the mortgage. So if you're able to cover his upfront costs, that is your relationship with the architect. Anybody who is thinking of getting involved with it--we got slightly stung with our first architect. You know, there are architects that work on spec so don't feed someone else, you know, in order to get your your project done because you'll end up throwing away money.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:08.271
Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with David Robinson, who's President and Director of United Harlem Growth Corporation, one of some two dozen corporations that are interested in this whole idea of urban homesteading. Now I can tell, David, in talking with you that you have obviously a very strong personal commitment to this but also can tell that you're learning a heck of a lot. And your expertise as someone in real estate and development is something that is obviously going to spill over to the rest of the people that you are associated with. One thing that sort of came to mind as I was listening to you talk, is that you really have to know your way around bureaucracies in order to move. One of the problems in the inner cities is how do people who have not generally confronted bureaucracies learn to deal with them. Now you happen to have had some experiences prior to getting into this--it helped you a little with that, but just take the whole range. What are some of the lessons that you've learned about dealing with bureaucracies and making things move?

David Robinson 00:17:15.990
I can tell you--as you say we have all learned and we are all becoming quite sharp. Keep your feelings at home. It is an unfortunate reality that don't nobody care about, you know, your survival or none of that. You know, when you run up against the bureaucracy you must have your--you must listen exactly what they want. And you got to deal on their turf because you've come down to their turf in order to survive. We had our feelings hurt more times than I want to count, because we came in leading with our emotions, you know, leading with the plight of our community, the plight of our families. And that ain't even what it's about. You know, it's about having the dynamics of real estate development that you need to do to get over. And so you must be--you must become a businessman. You must become--you must be moving towards becoming a professional. You have to be moving towards becoming sharp. You got to know exactly what you're doing, all of it is eventually very precise because you're working with eventually, a three to five percent contingency, you know, on your whole operation. And you cannot--if you're going to get over, you must eventually become, you know, very good in what you do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:36.360
It's alleged that one of the main outcomes of the so-called War on Poverty, and the community corporations, was the teaching of literally thousands of people, maybe tens of thousands of people. Some of the expertise that is necessary to function within the system, because even though many people were involved in the militancy of the late sixties talked about down with the system, the fact is that there has to be some kind of system, whether it's this system or another system. And there are certain rules that are involved in working things in an orderly fashion. And as you pointed out when you have an error margin of three or five percent and you begin to build up error here and error there, you're out of business. And one of the things, and this has transferred to Black businesses as well, one of the things that we've learned about Black businesses, and we've had Black businesspeople on the program, is that you need to plan what you're going to do and the way you're going to do it. And whereas the emotion as you [stated] at the beginning of the program, the survival instinct is what causes you to do this. In the final analysis, getting it done is going to be a function of the extent to which you clearly think that what you're going to do. And I was thinking particularly about, you said you have to be careful and I noted the whole area of reading. There are so many contracts and statements and we're talking about improving reading of our residents in our inner cities. One clear way to learn how to read better is to misread something and to get stung and to have to come back and read it all over again. So you really have a number of collateral things that are happening. Are you doing anything to document this process?

David Robinson 00:20:14.370
One of the nice things about construction is it is extremely physical. You know, if you come up we have photographs, yes, of the buildings as they were and as they are now and then we will have photographs of as they will be. There are a number of construction journals that are kept in relationship to a project. The documentation will actually be in the end product itself. One of the things that, in terms of working with the system or within the system, I think that what we are attempting to do is negotiate with the system, which is slightly different than working within the system because you come from your own concerns and negotiate, yes, on their turf, in their terminology, you know, but you are--to be in the system, I think systems by the nature of things really don't--aren't structured to work for the benefit of you, you know, so you step out of that, find out what it is that the system--the terminologies of the system and then negotiate with it, you know, in the best--in whatever manner is necessary for you to achieve your primary objective which is survival in whatever area.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:25.330
That's very interesting, you said the systems are not made to work for you, yet in the body politic the reason why real estate bureaus and health services and hospital bureaus are created ostensibly to provide services to people in the society. And of course you said--you already said you have to leave your emotions home at least when you begin to deal with them. Could you reflect a little bit on that business about your feeling that systems aren't made to work for people or is it something about people who work for systems that don't serve people?

David Robinson 00:22:02.620
I think systems come with a lot of rhetoric, you know, and the rhetoric can talk about benefiting people, but I would--if you look at things, it's really the chump change issues that--the chump change and the scraps, you know, that are given to benefit the people more in terms of keeping the people satisfied enough, you know, and alive enough to benefit again the systems. I think it was the Romans who created the welfare state and they did it, they created welfare not so much because there were people who were hungry but they had an element of the population which was starving, dissatisfied, and it was more efficient in terms of the overall system to give these people some money rather than have to fight a war with them or something. So I think that, you know, systems--it's unfortunate and I think it's a growing problem because--there is an increasing conflict between the systems and people because the dynamics--if you look at the real estate industry, unions came along in order to benefit the working people and it was a very good situation because people were being exploited. But as the unions developed, they themselves became a system, they themselves became exclusive, and they themselves then became part of the problem because we now cannot afford to pay a union carpenter, a union electrician, a union anybody, twenty dollars an hour in order to sustain his house in Long Island, you know, when we cannot--because we cannot pay that on a twenty year basis at eight percent interest. So we have had to--we have to discuss with the systems, negotiate with the union systems in order to make it clear that we're not in conflict with any systems, all we're looking to do is survive. And I think it is tremendously important that people within the system, the system itself, do not see people-oriented movements as something that is in conflict with them but more it's something to allow everyone to survive because you come into very big problems when one element of the population doesn't survive based on the status quo. And that's a much bigger problem than if the system allows itself to open up and give people options to live.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:44.890
Speaking of the unions and building, you will have plumbing and electricity to deal with and most of you basically untrained in this. How are you going to handle that particular part of your project?

David Robinson 00:24:56.201
We are contracting with professional licensed plumbers and electricians in order to carry out that work. Our people will work with those licensed plumbers and electricians in order to gain some of the knowledge. Again it's a compromise relationship with the unions. We are not using union men in terms of our general labor force but there are people who come from that area. And again, I think there is enough work within this country, if this country opens up such that union men can work and sustain their lifestyle at their income level and that low income communities can develop within themselves and sustain themselves. For the unions to attempt to take off the low income community, it's a very bad situation because you are you are forcing people up against the wall and naturally you will get an adverse reaction. But if you allow poor people to take care of their own, that will free up a lot of the rest of the economy for the union people to move into, you know, the middle income and luxury housing apartment and office buildings.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:02.402
All right, now I'm sure as a result of your activities a number of people have come to you for advice and assistance. Could you tell our audience a little bit about what kind of advice, if any, you can give them at this point other than to get a lot of muscle power and some persistence, and also you may give them your telephone number so the people who are interested in following up might call you.

David Robinson 00:26:22.240
Yeah, I think--just what you said, muscle power and persistence is--and organizing--is the first level. Understand that you are in trouble, you know, and that ain't nobody going to get help you get out of trouble, such that you had best begin to deal with it yourself. We are--it's a self-oriented survival movement. We are not out to save the world. We are out to save ourselves and anybody can--we try to assist in it was that we did, so other people can can copy that. Our phone number is 865-4118. And we're about aiding, because our little operation is going to be washed away if there are not three, four, five, six dozen groups like ourselves working and working successfully,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:16.450
Are there groups outside of Harlem doing the same thing?

David Robinson 00:27:19.531
Yes, there are. Lower East Side, the Bronx, Ocean Hill, Brownsville--there are, as is we was talking about, two dozen, at least two dozen corporations who are organized and dealing on this level.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:30.640
Are there any places in the official bureaucracy, at the real estate department where people might get information about this program about urban homesteading?

David Robinson 00:27:38.640
Yeah. The Community Management Division, City of New York; Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, known as UHAB. I'll throw out all the groups: in the Lower East Side it's Adopt A Building, in the Bronx it's People['s] Development Corporation, on the east side in Harlem it's the Renegades. Everybody who is about this will aid, you know, so so just call in and everyone will do the best they can.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:08.002
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been David Robinson, President and Director of United Harlem Growth Corporation and we've been talking about this exciting move in the area of urban homesteading. Those in the audience who want to get information and possibly some motivation from David and his group, should call 865-4118. This move, I believe and I think you believe David, is one of the things that's going to keep New York City livable and also provides for an alternate to the system so that we can negotiate with it. So right on and good luck to you David.

David Robinson 00:28:43.750
Thank you very much.
