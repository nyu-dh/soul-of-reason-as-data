What will be the impact of this new administration on the black community here Basil Paterson vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee discuss the future of blacks in the political life of the nation. On Tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:45.760
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 1 00:01:10.090
With us this evening on soul of reason is Basil Patterson who is vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and President of the Institute for mediation and conflict resolution.

Speaker 3 00:01:20.440
And in your capacity as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee I know you've done a lot of mediation and conflict resolution basil.

Speaker 4 00:01:27.140
No I'm often accused of not being a mediator in that role. Yeah that really well that's more of an advocacy role.

Speaker 1 00:01:33.850
All right well let's begin. We talked about what's going to happen on January 20th and Jimmy Carter will apply to mountain and he will receive the accolades of the position. What's going to be the impact that this new administration on the black community.

Speaker 5 00:01:49.540
Well there's a great deal of wariness at this point. We are in the black community because of the appointments to the cabinet. I I don't believe anybody could fairly say that they have been well received in the black community. They have not been and they have not been particularly well received in the liberal democratic community is a great belief that the appointments seem more nearly to represent interests other than those of working class people. Now however I don't think that happened. I really don't know I I think see I happen to feel that a man who is elected president has the right to select whomever he believes is going to be most compatible and most helpful to him in the work that he undertakes who he also believes will be approved by the United States Senate by way of the confirmation proceedings. I think what happened here though is that there were so many pontifical statements being made by people all over the place that they believed that there was gonna be a cabinet composed of super human beings. Some of these people are outstanding. Some of them are not outstanding some mediocre because there's nothing unusual about that. I'm quite sure the same analysis would have been made of Franklin Roosevelt's Cabinet or John Kennedy's. These things happen I don't think it's a cause for any great alarm but it is cause for concern.

Speaker 3 00:03:23.080
Well isn't it possible that Carter hymns but that on himself during his campaign because he talked about this was a slogan why not the best and how he's going to involve blacks and women and liberals and consumer advocates etc. and he wasn't going to go back to the people who had made the mess in Washington. Looks like he went back to at least three fourths of the people who made the mess in Washington.

Speaker 5 00:03:44.510
Yes of course he brought it upon himself. But again I don't believe that we should think that a man is elected president you know overnight become super man but he learns his job. And I think we'll see in six months time a different man from the one who is inaugurated on the 20th. This is not unusual. I just don't think it's unusual. I think if you look back in history and look at these you mentioned he's the thirty ninth president you look at all the others they went through very similar circumstances. The reasons I said before that it's create a lot of attention undoubtedly is because of the statements that he made during the campaign and immediately after election. But as I said Voight he'll learn his job and he's a bright man. I think he'll do a good job.

Speaker 6 00:04:29.350
Well given the fact that you and several other black leaders advocated that blacks vote and basically vote Democratic. Now that you're a man let's say our man is in the house at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue. What do you think's going to really happen. Because as you've already said the appointments to the cabinet sort of disappointed us. We really have only one Cabinet officer that's Patricia Harris and we have another one who sits with the cabinet. Andy Young is the ambassador to United Nations. What do you think the administration is going to do that will address the concerns of the black community.

Speaker 7 00:05:12.790
Well you certainly raise what I consider the most compelling cause for consideration at this time. As you said blacks were response for Mr. Carter's election. I carry a list in my pocket of various states in the margins by which he won states like Ohio way when my seventy five hundred votes the black votes he got two hundred ninety thousand ninety five percent of all black votes cast Missouri wins by 67000. He gets one hundred thirty six thousand black votes our state he wins by twenty seventy five thousand he gets eight hundred thousand black votes. Even Mississippi way wins by eleven thousand five hundred. He got one hundred forty seven thousand five hundred votes from black people. Texas Arkansas Georgia Florida you name the states that he won in the southern states which are greatly given the credit for his election.

Speaker 5 00:06:09.980
You find that he receives only 45 percent of the white vote. Gerald Ford received 54 percent of it. The margin of difference that elected him where the black votes cast well over 90 percent in his favor. There has never been a single instance in history where one group particular minority group evidence such a clear situation of electing a president. Therefore blacks feel the tradition has been that those who elected a man receive prime consideration not only his appointments but in his programs because they responded to him in the hopes that he was going to alleviate many of their problems. This now moves us into what I think is very critical. We went out and we asked black people to vote in the system. We asked them to elect the president and beyond anybody's wildest expectations it happened.

Speaker 7 00:07:12.140
The blacks elected a president. How do we now say the black people continue to participate in this system. If the system once they have mastered its art does not respond to their needs. I think it's a tough question. I also recognize that we have to take a good close look at it no matter who are presently elected by he seeks to be popular.

Speaker 5 00:07:35.780
He seeks to be reelected while he is not going to make moves that would isolate him with just one segment of the community no matter what balance of power they may have wielded in the past election.

Speaker 1 00:07:47.300
Of course you do have a crucial element in regard to the black community going back to the 1968 67 the age of the riots.

Speaker 3 00:07:57.470
I think that this country for the first time realized the time bomb that the black citizen poses for them. Recently we've been saying. Got it by 1972. All right. But let that go by. Recently we've been seeing all these programs about the agitation to eliminate slavery. The program it's been on Channel 13 the upcoming routes and the like. And we recognize that America in the middle 19th century went through a bloodletting and a form of facing some kind of reality that they haven't had to do until again the middle of the 20th century. And you said very rapidly they seem to have been forgetting the lessons that might have been learned from the riots. Now you're saying that we've asked the black community to accept the system to work in the system so they got it then they voted they elected a lot of people they elected the president in particular. And now we are saying that the issues that the black community are concerned about is number one jobs. Basically if you put money in people's pockets all of the problems of health differences and cultural deprivation and education and crime and so on will begin to disappear. So the first thing the black community is asking for is a turnaround of the economy namely jobs jobs for those teenagers who are unemployed to the amount of 50 and 60 and 70 percent jobs in the average urban community where the male workers are unemployed upwards of 20 and 25 percent. What do you think the Carter administration going to do about that.

Speaker 5 00:09:33.140
What do you think they can do about it Well I think the best hope that we as blacks have is that there's been somewhat of a democratization of deprivation that we are not the only ones unemployed. I say that and I hope it doesn't sound too cynical but the history of this country has been that when blacks solely were the ones who were deprived that it was ignored. You talk about the riot season of the middle 60s. I contend that by 1970 it was out of the minds of Americans. You talked in terms of the pressures upon this country the strains and stresses upon the very system. And I suggest to you that these things become thought about when they are staring us directly in front of us. I could go into the problem of Namibia and Zimbabwe and the possibility of that scenario being played out just like Vietnam and some people say no. Never again will it happen that American troops will be committed to military action on foreign soil such as that. And you said hey I wonder what happens if we find Cuban troops moving in from Angola into Namibia maybe encouraged by the South Africans to do it maybe incursions being made manipulated a Machiavellian like by the South African government. What happens when that that banner of communism starts being waved in the faces of Americans. Do they say let's stand back let's allow some other nation to be getting control of the strategic area and control of valuable resources that we need for our economy. I'm suggesting to you that the history of this nation has been one of quick forgetfulness. And I agree with you. The biggest problem that black people have is not just black people. Last year over 22 million people were out of work for at least six weeks. That's democratization of deprivation. That's our best hope. And yet we both know that there has been a steady decline in interest in the hawk and some very full employment bill. Now why do you think that is. Well the arguments being made for the federal government to get into this area would contribute even further to inflation. Inflation is beginning to be is beginning to lessen. It looks like it may be under control but by the same token what do you do about it constant hovering 8 percent unemployment in this nation as you rightly said black unemployment they always tell us it's twice what white unemployment is now. It's considerably more. We are in the category of the discouraged workers who stop seeking employment because none can be found we stopped reporting to the employment service therefore we no longer counted. We are the community that falls to the category of needing more than two jobs to keep a family supported of needing overtime jobs. We always moonlighted because the first job never brought sufficient income to cover our expenses and we're not counted when we lose that second job we're not counted when we lose the overtime pay upon which we depended when I counted on that part time employment of our youngsters is no longer available of our wives so that our unemployment statistics are far above twice what White is but still the white unemployment is high. And that's creating a pressure Leonard Woodcock the out. About to be retiring president the United Auto Workers talks about the stress on our society of this massive unemployment. About the inability maybe of our system to absorb the costly rising number of people seeking jobs. He talks in terms of share work programs he talks in terms of reducing work the workweek reducing the the year work cycle and yet nobody seems to be listening yet. But that stress is coming when Leonard Woodcock talks about a leader of one of the major national unions in this nation. You have to begin to understand that some people are thinking about changing part of our system of modifying and qualifying it. So I would join you in saying jobs would have to be the key question and it's going to have to be looked at different from the way it's been looked at in the past. And President Carter is going to have to bring people into government who have the imagination and the foresight to recognize that this is the overriding issue of our time.

Speaker 6 00:14:04.840
The thing that I wonder about is whether the apparent go slow policy that seems to be being projected by cautious fiscal advisers is almost like let's ride it out this past month a few of the economic indicators improved a little Let's ride it out. Let's not do too much in terms of a tax cut because it might bring about too much inflation. That's not due to much about public service jobs because we don't know how to use public service jobs. I'm really afraid that in the black community at least if there isn't some fairly dramatic action after January 20th let's say in the first 100 days that this is going to be a tough summer because last summer between the bicentennial and the presidential campaign and the idea of well look we've made it for 200 years maybe things will be better in the next hundred sort of kept people quiet. But after this great bombast of celebration of the Bicentennial and after our man as it were winning I'm really very much Fred that unless some dramatic things are done that the black community particularly those unemployed kids and those discouraged fathers and mothers will not stand still in another hot summer. And I think that's something that quite possibly the Jimmy Carter people haven't heard yet.

Speaker 7 00:15:25.400
Roscoe what disturbs me is that I've lived in Harlem all my life. I've seen at least I was old enough to see a ride in 1936 on 120 history a riot for jobs even though it was a black community. The main street didn't have jobs for black people. I saw the riot when I was about to go into service in 1943 stemming from the beating of a black woman in a hotel Braddock by a police officer. Actually the shooting of a soldier who nobody ever heard. Yes he is later that in his court martial he was acquitted just by coincidence. When my law partners was the reporter for that court martial and that's how I found out about it many years later that man was acquitted. Now we've seen the riots of 64. We've seen the mini riots seen the Martin Luther King death in 68 and the riots erupted. Then I think what we've seen though is primarily black people being victimized by those riots when those buildings burnt. Those were black people living in those buildings. When those stores were looted it was very conceivable except black people had to pay the cost for the looting.

Speaker 5 00:16:46.580
I don't want to see that again and I'm not suggesting that we redirect our our target because a lot of us are concerned that preparations have long since been made in this country for just such an eventuality. I can very well see black people being shot down in the street in in thousands in this country just as they've been shot down the streets and other places. You push anybody to the wall you start threatening and those with the arms to strike you down will use them. You know I'm hopeful that Jimmy Carter is going to have the the wisdom and at least the exposure to the problems so that he understands that in his first few months that era of good feeling that he will have that supportive period before he has any antagonisms or that with a Democratic controlled Congress that he will move quickly and imaginatively to reduce unemployment as quickly as he can. I am concerned by his statement that he made I hope that this wasn't too well thought out. That the best he can hope for is reducing unemployment by one and a half percent one and a half percent from 8 percent get you down to six and a half percent and still is black unemployment at 120 percent. Exactly. Now there is a way to work on that if he moves into targeted program areas such as you just mentioned public service employment the old conservation and civilian conservation corps idea probably erecting like directing it at at the areas where there's massive unemployment directing it at youth unemployment. We could probably write it out and we probably would have such an impact on relieving real suffering that he could have some time to work on other programs but he's got to move quickly. I agree with you.

Speaker 1 00:18:35.140
This is an agency this evening on soul of reason we are talking with Basil Patterson who is vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and President of the Institute for mediation and conflict resolution and basil since we've talked about your role in the Democratic Party.

Speaker 6 00:18:51.520
What is going to be the role of Basil Paterson and the role of other blacks in the Democratic court party for the next four years.

Speaker 7 00:18:58.690
Well let me take him in the order you put. I have already manufactured fully two weeks ago I wrote a letter to the national chairman Robert Strauss announcing that I would not seek re-election to oppose the vice chairman.

Speaker 5 00:19:12.160
I also indicated that I wanted to resign. He knew I want to resign before this but the pressures of time are prohibitive. I've spent four years darn near commuting between Washington New York and making my trips to Los Angeles and San Francisco in Billings Montana in Indianapolis. It takes a lot of your life. I have to earn my living. It's been an on salary post. I just can't afford to continue it.

Speaker 4 00:19:41.410
I must say Bob I said the same thing. Well it's true it's true. It was unsolved for him too. But he said he couldn't continue else if it's something innovation face up to their new rules of Democratic Party by forgets that in December 1974 we passed our new charter we mandated that the next chairman starting January 1977 would be a full time Washington based position. We had one little oversight. We didn't give him a salary that's going to be a very difficult problem. First order of business should be to vote the new chairman a salary and to vote him the accoutrements that he requires. But we will be making every effort. There are meetings that we have been holding and meetings we have planned to try to assure that we will continue to have the input and Democratic Party that we've had in the past four years. Your listeners may or may not be aware that the changes in Democratic Party have been darn near revolutionary in that period. We pushed for affirmative action all party affairs it was a four year fight finally wanted at the convention just this year we came up the people said there were quotas in 1972 and they knocked out any possibility of a misreading of the of the rules to make sure there were no quotas. We came up with something called specific goals and timetables and syncing in the job area that's not considered a quota. We were able to get that through at the convention in just this year. So we've made some moves. We have increased the representation of blacks in the Nash committee. We have had an outstanding young man serving as the executive director of our office of Minority Affairs Frank Cowan. He too is resigning he says if I'm going. He is going also. But we are going to be seeking again to put in the kind of people will do the kind of work continue the pressure because let's understand it. You don't have to look at villains in this instance you just have to understand if you have a different agenda from other people you have to maintain the pressure if you want to see change. Change doesn't come easily. People are afraid of change. They think it's strange. And if you don't push you don't press things will continue with the status quo and for black people the status quo is a net.

Speaker 6 00:21:48.740
Well of course some people respond to this by saying look we change these rules. We have the voting rights act. We vote. We participate. But things really haven't changed measurably for black people. Now it goes back to something you said earlier in the show and that is that this is a put up or shut up time I think for America in its treatment of blacks for example. I think I personally am very disappointed with the Cabinet appointments. We have one bonafide a cabinet person a black person in the cabinet. We thus far in terms of some of the regulatory agencies and things like that no black person has emerged true enough. They'll pull a name like Andrew Bremmer who was formerly with the Federal Reserve Bank.

Speaker 8 00:22:34.280
Oh excellent person. But there are a lot of other literally thousands of other blacks who can perform any one of these important tasks. Yet for some reason or another the powers that be including the very people who are advising the president elect have not seen fit to put blacks in those positions where they can have power and basically that's what the political process is about.

Speaker 3 00:22:59.060
So when you leave the Democratic National Committee and Frank Collins leaves the question is who's going to step in there and do something other than keep the seat warm.

Speaker 4 00:23:08.180
Well let me just make one quick comment about the change rules or change rules just occurred as I said it was a four year fight. We finally won just in July this year. That's going to assure one thing that our representation within the party is going to be greater than it's ever been in the past. But of course the question people ask is what difference does that make. Unless you can effectuate the programs that mean something for the mass of people so I'd have to agree with you. And that is ultimately dependent upon the president the United States. We worked eight years to get a Democratic president. We suffered through eight years of a reactionary Nixon Ford administration. We obviously as blacks as working people as those who consider ourselves progressives are looking to see an administration that moves vigorously to leaving out the problems that this country has. I share your concerns and I just keep hoping that when they get to the point of filling those subcabinet posts and those agency heads in those other departments that we in the commissions let's not forget them. You're broadcasting here. We're losing Benjamin Hooks from the Federal Communications Commission who's going to be his replacement not only who's going to be his replacement who's going to be the new chairman what's their philosophical outlook going to be. Are they going to be a you know it doesn't matter what you call a man a Democrat. I mean I just catch a lot of help the Democratic Party about this because I'd go around the country and say listen you're a Democrat. I'm a Democrat but my Democratic Party is responding to the needs of my community and I look in Democratic Party and I see the people I've been fighting for for years. Well I thought Republican Party was irrelevant. Well I hope Democratic Party doesn't become irrelevant. But that's always a risk. I think black people have to keep their minds open. We have to remain flexible prepared to move in different directions prepare to exert our pressures and our powers in different ways. You're fully aware you participated you lent your vast professional support to the caucus of black Democrats and Nash course black Democrats which I which I served as chairman of in our meeting in Charlotte. You know that we came up with very specific issue oriented positions. We were talking and we wrote the Democratic platform. We were fortunate we got a lot of our our positions put into it. We talked about full employment. We talked about national health insurance. We talked about a housing program. We talked about a new foreign policy. We talked about the rule of the majority in South Africa. We talked about aid to rural and small town areas as well as massive aid to urban areas. What we what we talked about energy. Yes we want to see we want to see programs that are going to help people. I like to say and I think it's a truism that if you help black people in this country it is a common denominator. You have helped everybody in this country.

Speaker 6 00:25:52.460
There's no question about that. And now that we've talked about the national scene let's talk about the local scene for a moment. We have a black man.

Speaker 9 00:26:03.770
President Percy Sutton who is being touted as a possible mayoral candidate assuming that the present mayor Abraham Beame doesn't run. What do you think about it. Maybe he doesn't run the possibility of a black man being elected mayor of the largest state in the nation.

Speaker 10 00:26:26.780
I'll put it as forthrightly as I can. Number one. I believe that. Abraham being will seek re-election as mayor. Number two and maybe I should've put this first. I believe that Percy Sutton will run irrespective who the other candidates are. Number three.

Speaker 11 00:26:43.250
I believe the press is certain has an excellent chance of being the next mayor of New York City how do you respond to the suggestion that as the blackmailers take over the cities with the exception of Los Angeles and Tom Bradley they're getting the cities when they're going down to rather than up.

Speaker 12 00:27:00.850
Well a lot of people used to run around and laugh about a state. I used to make that. There's no question about New York City having a black mayor since it approached bankruptcy we'd get a black man. I made that statement about five years ago and it may look that way but I don't believe. That that's going to happen New York City is not going to go bankrupt. Jimmy Carter is a shoulder that he gave his word. Well said you can count on it. I think it's going to happen primarily because New Yorkers are pinching. Their belts and tightening them. I think what's really happening is the people of New York City. Have gone through a period of austerity. Jobs have been cut back. Services have been cut back but New York City to survive. I think it's a tribute to the vitality of the people this city. I believe that. This question about black men is technically bankrupt cities that Newark was going through the swamp and yet it didn't. Under Ken Gibson Gary Indiana is still surviving under Richard Hatcher. Cleveland didn't die because Carl Stokes was mayor. Los Angeles looks like it's doing pretty well under Coleman Young rather under Tom Bradley. Detroit for all its problems probably surviving better than it could have. Had it not been for Coleman Young as mayor. Now we we have a lot to be thankful for. Maynard Jackson moves vigorously and well to Atlanta. New York City will do well under pressure that.

Speaker 11 00:28:14.740
All right I think that's a good point I wish to close our discussion tonight. Our guest on tonight's sole reason has been Basil Paterson who vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and President of the Institute for mediation and conflict resolution. And we've been discussing the impact of the new administration on the black community the challenges that Jimmy Carter and his administration will face and the particular role that black people have played and will play in the political process of America. Thanks again Basil for being our guest on tonight's show. Thanks for having me.
