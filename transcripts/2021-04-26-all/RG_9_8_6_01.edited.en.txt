What happens to youth who are placed on probation by the courts? How does the Urban League's youth enrichment program help these youth? What does outdoor living and education contribute to the development of youth? Here William Covington Special Assistant to the project director of the Urban League's Youth Enrichment Program discuss these questions on tonight's "Soul of Reason".

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:46.350
This is "Soul of Reason", a program that will examine the roots of the black box. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. Director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:12.780
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Bill Covington, Special Assistant to the program director of a very creative program sponsored by The New York Urban League called the "Youth Enrichment Program" and possibly Bill you could begin by explaining to our audience exactly what the Youth Enrichment Program is and what its purpose is.

Bill Covington 00:01:32.190
Well the Youth Enrichment Services Program was designed to deal with young people on probation between the ages of 14 and 21 who live in the area bounded south by Ninety Fifth Street north by a Hundred and Sixty Eighth Street and from river to river. And what we hope to do is to reduce the recidivism rate among young people in this area which was once 66 percent. But, we hoped through an innovative program with our multiplicity of alternatives we would be able to provide them with alternatives to their previous way of life. Now the Youth Enrichment services is funded under the omnibus bill of the Safe Streets Act and we're subcontracted to the New York City Department of Probation to service a certain number of young people on probation and they're also matching funds which are supplied by the New York Urban League.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:24.330
Now what are some of the type of offenses these young people have been into just in general?

Bill Covington 00:02:29.431
We have a multiplicity of offenses.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:31.111
It's a whole range of offensives.

Bill Covington 00:02:32.642
The whole range but-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:33.751
So that then a judge has seen fit with the recommendation of a probation officer to put the young people on probation which means this is usually a first apprehension for most.

Bill Covington 00:02:43.180
Well sometimes it's a first apprehension. Sometimes it's just simply the fact that the jails are overcrowded and we and when the jails are overcrowded there's a tendency to place more people on probation than there is when you could say the jails are empty. Also, some of the young people we're involved with are a very young age and incarceration would do them very little good if any whatsoever.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:05.220
Now that certainly is a fact given the way in which many of our institutions operate. But what do you do now you have these young people and they are on probation now. I would gather from the way you describe it that most of them are out of school. Or are some of them in school yet?

Bill Covington 00:03:23.310
Well most of them are out of school. But what we trying to do is through an innovative approach of having won a Harlem based probation center. Number two having young people work with them as probation officers we call them advocators and these young people are usually age 22 to 30. And what we also have is we have facilities for jobs where we are you have a job developer who works and trying to get them jobs. We try to use the Urban League Job Bank to find employment. We have the Urban League street academies which we work with and try and place young people who need remedial skills or who are trying to get their high school diploma we place them in these academies or we try to get them back in the public schools. We have a cultural and recreational program where we have cultural, recreational, educational alternatives for young people who are interested in these things. We have an outdoor program where we engage in vigorous physical outdoor activity.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:24.230
Now let me ask a question about the number of people who are in this. What, how many young people in this? Are they all males for example?

Bill Covington 00:04:34.322
No, we take both male and female.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:35.822
And your counselors are your counselors--

Bill Covington 00:04:38.371
Both male and female.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:39.211
Male and female. And I would imagine some are from Puerto Rican or Hispanic background as well.

Bill Covington 00:04:43.671
Well yes. Well yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:45.121
Now what do you do? How does how does the program actually work? Who makes the decision as to what happens to a particular young person?

Bill Covington 00:04:52.920
Well what happens is we get our young people from the family, criminal or supreme courts of New York and what happens is if a person has committed a certain offense and they are found guilty and placed on probation if they are between the ages of 14 and 21 and live in our geographical area and if they are not using drugs on a regular basis you know as long as they're not mainlining then they are considered eligible for our program. The program is voluntary. It's explained to them. They're asked if they want to go win it and those who do you know are usually assigned to us.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:28.110
I see now this outdoor living phase, you told me sometime back that you had a they had a program in the agency where the young people went to camp and they went through some very arduous almost survival type training. Now I know you use the term outdoor living and education. Could you tell us a little about that particular phase of the program?

Bill Covington 00:05:47.390
Right well this is one of the unique concepts of our program. What we're trying to do is by using the outdoors as a challenge and also as a classroom we hope to get across various points through the use of the outdoors that we may not necessarily bring it be able to bring about in the city. One of the old one of the things we're trying to do is to get young people to develop a survival mentality. This is something the outdoors can do for you because you're out there. You have to survive and function in certain ways. This is the same way society operates. There are certain things you have to do to survive. There's certain things you have to do to function and there's only a certain amount of leeway in both places with hope the skills that we can apply in the outdoors can be later brought back to the city and applied everyday living in society.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:33.330
Now in this program the young people go to a camp. How far away is the camp--

Bill Covington 00:06:38.680
We have a camp up in the Adirondacks which is about a four hour drive north.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:42.151
This is owned by your organization--

Bill Covington 00:06:43.800
No it's leased by our-- leased by our organization

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:45.210
Leased by the organization. And does it run a year round basis or is it just for the summer?

Bill Covington 00:06:49.590
Well we try to run on a year round basis. We've had in the winter we've had snowshoeing and outdoor expeditions where you know we do overnight hikes things along this line in the winter. In the summer we have a water program swimming, canoes, using rafts. And we have outdoor expeditions that can last four and five days going up into the mountains. And during these expeditions we tried to implement certain skills that you need to survive in the outdoors use of your equipment self-discipline teamwork things along this line. And we had originally hoped that it could we could get a more isolated area but we're sort of making do with what we have here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:30.450
Now you stress the teamwork and cooperation. Now how do you how does. Let's take an outdoor situation what would happen in this particular situation that would cause these young people to develop more teamwork than they would have developed just in a general growing up.

Bill Covington 00:07:47.520
Well let's say you have three people who are here who have a tent that they have to sleep in that night. Now the three of them will have to get together and work as a team to set up their tent. It can no longer be an individual thing but each person has to cooperate in a certain way. So that tent will stand up the entire night.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:04.810
So I suppose one guy sort of one guy sort of opts out. But how do the counselors deal with that?

Bill Covington 00:08:11.610
Well we hope to put it in a situation where there will be peer pressure where if this one person doesn't want to cooperate in setting up the tent the tent does not get set up and hence when it rains tonight the rain will ring in and all three of them and perhaps the other two will speak to him or persuade him in one way or the other to see the necessity for setting up this tent. It's the type of thing where we hope we can establish such as a situation where everyone will see the necessity for meeting a certain goal and once everyone sees the necessity of it they simply proceed to do it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:44.280
Now do you do much with leadership skills by leadership skills is helping to make these young people leaders it's a lead sometimes that the young men particularly the Black community who get involved in crime sometimes are people who have latent leadership skills and they haven't been able to channel these skills into socially acceptable channels. In your outdoor program do you do much in terms of trying to develop leadership skills?

Bill Covington 00:09:11.040
Well this is something that almost comes forth on its own because once you've mastered the basic skills of living in the outdoors you become a leader because other people look up to you because they need that skill.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:21.771
Yeah. By the way what are some of those basic skills and living in the outdoors.

Bill Covington 00:09:24.511
All right well you can just simply look one would simply be keeping yourself warm building a fire you know, cooking things along this line chopping wood setting up a tent reading a map and compass so you can be able to get out of there having certain knowledge of what is edible on the trail having a certain knowledge of simply how to wear a pack and how to wear your garments in such a way that you will have the maximum amount of comfort while you're trekking through the woods for you know maybe four and five hours at a time. It's just. So many little things that you just sort of pick up and you acquire when you're out there and these things can do so much to make you more comfortable in the experience because the difference between comfort and a great time and discomfort and a completely miserable time is simply knowledge. And we hope to pass on this knowledge in such a way that people will see the necessity for it and they'll sort of grab it up.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:17.011
All right now. So they've been to camp and how long do they stay?

Bill Covington 00:10:20.270
They can vary anytime any anywhere from three days to three to four weeks. It depends upon the time of the year. It depends upon how many young people we have up there and what we're trying to accomplish.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:30.660
What's the maximum the camp can accommodate?

Bill Covington 00:10:32.951
The maximum maximum what number of people?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:34.852
The number of people.

Bill Covington 00:10:35.792
We could accommodate close to 75, 80 kids.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:40.592
But generally about how many do you have?

Bill Covington 00:10:42.240
Generally we try to keep groups of 20 or 25.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:44.132
Now when these groups have gone through this experience and where you've described it it's a fairly arduous experience and certainly a valuable one.

Bill Covington 00:10:52.630
Well it's arduous in the sense that you're not in the city.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:54.912
Where it's arduous in the sense that I gather from what you describe they have to cook their own food--

Bill Covington 00:10:59.831
Yeah well that's not really that arduous. I mean yeah

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:02.532
Contrasted with going to the supermarket.--

Bill Covington 00:11:05.051
Right. Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:06.191
Frozen pizzas a little arduous but having developed this insight into themselves into cooperation etc.. What then happens when young people come back to the city to your program what are some of the things you do to continue the development of these skills that have been acquired?

Bill Covington 00:11:24.970
Well the most important thing we try to do is show them the relationship between the development of skills to survive and be comfortable up there and the development of skills to survive and be comfortable in the society. This is why we stress education so much.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:37.990
In other words as I was gathered in where you described it that they're working in a group with a counselor and when a particular task identified here in the city and youngsters begin to get a little resistant then the counselor steps in and tries to make the transition from the use of certain survival skills that they had acquired in the out of doors to the use of education for example as a survival skill.

Bill Covington 00:12:03.340
Well that's exactly it. But also as a as a means of achieving you know your own personal ends because maybe someone would desire to have a car or maybe a coat or something along this line. And the way they can get it is either through the job or through education. But we're trying to help people plan for the future look forward to what they want in the future and show them how they can get it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:30.260
Now do does this come in to the job situation? For example when you have one of these youngsters who has been to the camp is now back he has to make a decision about school he has made a decision about a job he probably has to make a decision about living accommodations possibly some of the young people do not have homes to live in. Exactly how do you tackle a problem or a series of problems like this?

Bill Covington 00:12:54.820
Well the advocator, you know this is the person who is working directly with him, along with the probation officer whose custody you know the young person is in--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:04.640
Now their probation officers on your staff?

Bill Covington 00:13:07.151
We have probation officers on our staff and they are nominally in charge of the cases but they assign them to advocators who worked underneath them.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:14.650
Now are the advocators people who have college training--

Bill Covington 00:13:18.042
Some do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:19.301
Or they are identified mainly because they are able to relate to the young people?

Bill Covington 00:13:22.091
Both. We have some who are college trained. We have some who have the equivalent of college training as far as their experiences in working in the community or being able to relate to young people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:31.991
Now, so the probation officer is responsible for a certain number of young people.

Bill Covington 00:13:37.801
Yes. He assigns them to the advocators who are responsible to him but have almost complete charge of that case.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:45.401
And then what does the advocator do? How does the advocator--

Bill Covington 00:13:48.340
Well in major decision making processes the advocator will talk to the young person, talk to the probation officer, if it's educational he may talk to our educational coordinator. Vocational he might talk to our vocational coordinator he might he will try to pull in parents or any other people any other interested parties in and have them all discuss this decision and have the decision made by everyone and then a plan of action can be developed that will all that everyone will be involved in and all will follow through on to help this young person meet that goal.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:20.711
Now what have your results been? How effective have you been in operation long enough to make some assessment of effectiveness?

Bill Covington 00:14:27.880
Well the hard the hard thing to do in summing up effectiveness is simply that we have to realize that we're fighting what we're dealing with the type of problem that is a problem of of environment and to really see if we were really effective or not it would be a program we'd have to run five to 10 more years certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:47.650
Well I was thinking I think terms of a criterion like the recidivism rate have you been able--

Bill Covington 00:14:51.910
Recidivism rate has gone down. We have we have reduced it to somewhere around 20 25 percent. I don't have the exact figures.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:00.221
What about the school returns?

Bill Covington 00:15:02.380
Oh yes we have a large number of young people back in school but school just recently started it just started last Monday. And so we're still going through the record keeping process, registration, programs, curriculums along that line. But the most important thing I think is one young people have a place where they can come.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:21.392
This is a physical location where is it located?

Bill Covington 00:15:23.711
One Hundred and 30th Street between Broadway and 12th Avenue.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:27.072
Between Broadway and 12th Avenue on One Hundred and 30th street. And that's a physical place is it a place where some people can live as well or live in some place.

Bill Covington 00:15:35.152
No we don't live in the facilities. It's our office and counseling office and counseling facilities. Also we have work out from there for young people who want to you know be involved in physical exertion we have a videotape workshop there. We had a dance and sewing classes there. Things along this line that you know young people might be interested in and would also help them develop some sort of skill.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:58.990
And so this is the place where everybody relates. This is the place where they go to report to the probation officer for example. How often does a young person have to report to probation officer?

Bill Covington 00:16:07.600
This is worked out between the young person, the probation officer, the advocator and the parent. It all depends upon the type of situation. If you have a young person who's going to school every day who is you know no problem in the home who is basically has an idea of what he wants to do and how he wants to go about it. We would only have him report on a minimal amount of you know a minimal basis. On the other hand if every young person who is unemployed is not going to school it's just sort of hanging out in the street. We'd like to keep close touch with them because we don't want to see them rearrested.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:40.960
Close touch maybe every day, every other day?

Bill Covington 00:16:43.360
Every other day maybe every day. Yeah it would all depend upon the advocator and how they advocator feels this case should be handled because we can also have the problems of over exposing ourselves to the young person too--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:54.760
And develop a dependency so that when they get into the so-called real world where they're no longer on probation the dependency situation.

Bill Covington 00:17:03.360
Oh yeah. This could be another case could be very easily developed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:06.550
Now you use the term advocator. And I use the term counselor. Undoubtedly you must have selected this term and this concept advocator as against counselor for a number of reasons. It could have come from a television program to advocate now--

Bill Covington 00:17:23.212
No it's because we advocate for our young people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:25.931
Or it could have come from a concept. Okay. In other words this person who I say forms a certain counseling role does more than that he really goes out and does things in a sense for, not doing them, for the young person but advocating.

Bill Covington 00:17:40.390
Yes that's exactly that's exactly the concept because an advocator is another word that could be almost used for a lawyer. And we have these we have our staff members out there advocating for the young people so that they can be able to simply survive in the society. We have someone who is out there sort of standing out front looking out for their best interests.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:03.790
Now the Urban League has been one of the co-sponsors of the program along with--

Bill Covington 00:18:10.241
The Department of Probation.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:11.081
The Department of Probation under the Safe Streets Act. Now it's interesting that this program comes up under a kind of a Law and Order Act yet on the other hand it seems to have very definite social advancement purposes. Is there any inconsistency in having an educational program sponsored by a so called Law and Order Act or is this part of what the society is about.

Bill Covington 00:18:38.260
No this was just simply part of the part of the Safe Streets Act was they allocated one billion dollars on a national basis to finding different alternatives to to incarceration, investigating ways of dealing with people who have come into conflict with the criminal system so that they won't come back into conflict with the criminal system. Now as far as what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do I think would be just simply to prepare some young people to survive. Now if the money had come from the Safe Streets Act then this is all well and good because we're dealing with young people who this may be a last chance program for also if our concept can be successful perhaps maybe it will go out on a broader basis and other people might look at it and may take some of the ideas that we have started to generate. And I think this is something we should look at very carefully because so many of our young people in the inner city come into conflict with the law. And if there can be some way to minimize this conflict I think that would be I think that would be a very good use of the taxpayers money.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:48.912
Because one suggestion might be, one way of minimizing the conflict is for young people not to come in contact with the law.

Bill Covington 00:19:57.411
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:57.820
And in a sense your concept of survival skills has to do with how do you survive. I'm going beyond that law or that line of legality that would in fact put you in trouble.

Bill Covington 00:20:10.480
Well that is exactly that is survival. Being able to maintain one's self without coming into conflict with whatever forces that be on the outside.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:19.000
I notice we've had a considerable number of minutes of conversation and not yet have we mentioned the drug problem. Knowing as I do that many of the engagements of young people with the law have to do with drug related type crimes many times stealing for support of drugs and so on. Is this something that's excluded from your program or if you do have people who have drug involvement do you relate to other programs that are anti-drug or drug control programs?

Bill Covington 00:20:50.790
Well our contract states that we are not supposed to take main-line heroin users. If we do have people who are using heroin. We try to refer them to a program that will be able to get them detoxed and eventually you know lose the entire habit. But we have no facilities for dealing.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:10.170
So basically your program might be what generally could be called a drug free program. You're not really relating to people whose criminal activity has come as a result of drug activity.

Bill Covington 00:21:23.340
Well the sickness of drugs is such that it can't help but affect everyone up there in the Harlem community. But it's just that we don't have facilities for dealing with the problem. Now we deal with a lot of the effects of the drug problem but we don't deal with drug users directly in terms of medical care.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:43.411
Which would then suggest that most of the drug related offenses are covered by other programs hopefully.

Bill Covington 00:21:51.270
Well I really I must say I really couldn't say.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:54.330
Because I can see that when you deal with a tough social problem like criminal activity in the urban community that a certain proportion of that is going to have some drug spillover.

Bill Covington 00:22:08.891
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:09.151
And if you're trying to deal with these problems on a collective basis it's kind of difficult to deal with them on a collective basis without in some way either having a drug component to your program or relating very closely to another drug program.

Bill Covington 00:22:21.690
Yes well the whole thing is all simply a matter of not only money but society's commitment to dealing with the problems that are in our cities and that transcend racial lines and the commitment to solving the drug problem and solving our social problems would almost have to be the equivalent of a commitment to a war. I think we have a tendency to look for the quick solution the sort of Band-Aid solution to very deep and very rooted problems and to deal with them effectively we just simply have to have the money and the people, the people in the country would simply have to be committed to having this problem around constantly and attacking it with the funds to kill it over a long period of time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:10.501
Well what do you think the effects of a program like yours like the Youth Enrichment Program are on this commitment or these commitments do you think that they tend to make society more aware of the need for commitments or do you think it tends to save society's conscience too easily?

Bill Covington 00:23:25.800
Well that's hard--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:27.120
That's a hard question.

Bill Covington 00:23:28.021
That's hard to say because one there is no longer the social emphasis on the problems of the inner city that there once was let's say in the 60s. So people are no longer looking at or are no longer interested in these problems. So our success or our failure could go unnoticed by society.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:44.730
Now when you say that that isn't completely consistent because the law act under which you are functioning is an act which does deal with things that happen in the inner city.

Bill Covington 00:23:57.931
It was passed in 68.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:00.481
Well but it's still being funded now. What I think you're uh I'm--

Bill Covington 00:24:04.921
What I'm saying is--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:04.925
Alluding to is that many of the social programs which are still legally on the books are not being funded now.

Bill Covington 00:24:11.490
I'm saying we're living off the residuals of the 60s and this is something we can't afford to do much longer because we're living in the 70s. Yeah well eventually when this runs out what kind of position will we be left in?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:21.930
When what runs out?

Bill Covington 00:24:22.831
All right. When money from acts like the Safe Streets Act, model cities, OEO. When all of this money eventually runs out and it's not refunded what would I tell young people that are working with us on probation where we have a very innovative dynamic program for them and then tell them you have to go back down to standard probation

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:39.752
Of course and I guess the point that I was trying to develop is that the money doesn't have to run out. The act is there. The legislation is there. The situation is that the present administration at least has a position which might be reflective of general society I don't know that there are other things that are more important so therefore they're not appropriating the money for programs of this type. On the other hand the various aspects of the law enforcement access say street acts are being funded but I think this reflects the fear of the larger society of what they see as a crime wave.

Bill Covington 00:25:21.270
Well the the Safe Streets Act like I said was passed in 68 but we will have to expire by next year. This is in our contract and there will be no, there is no renewal clause in it. And it just simply leads us back to the same problem. I do believe that if society as a whole were committed to solving this problem it would be solved. If people had the same interest in solving crime that they have in football then we simply wouldn't have these problems.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:49.180
Yeah that's probably true. But the question is how does one get, other than discussions of this type and discussion of the type of thing that you do in into the media how does one get society to develop this type of commitment. For example you say that this program which you're in is supposed to end by statutory requirement in a year. What would preclude society through a variety of ways of putting pressure on its legal representatives congressmen to get this program extended. Is this the type of program for example you think should be extended? Or do you think other things should be done.

Bill Covington 00:26:24.550
Well I definitely think it should be extended simply because it's cheaper. It's cheaper to fund our program than to spend seven thousand dollars per person to keep a young person in jail for a year.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:33.581
What are your per capita costs on this?

Bill Covington 00:26:36.222
Our per capita costs on the well, over a two year period we're spending something along the lines of two million dollars. If we add for 350 kids if you work out maybe two years in jail for each of them it comes to a much greater cost than what we are spending and what we are coming up with also besides, besides saving money as compared to jail we're also making what you might call productive citizens.--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:01.230
That's the more important thing.

Bill Covington 00:27:02.113
These are young people who will,who will if you look at it rather cynically will pay taxes. These are young people who will support the government. These are young people who will be very productive for industry and for business. And these are young people who once they get out will keep the economy going and it's it's too easy right now. It's a very easy thing if society will take the interest in rehabilitating young people then it can be better collectively for all of us in the long run. Whereas if we maintain the present attitude of hysteria or harsh punishment in terms of dealing with people who have committed crimes then we will only reap what we sew.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:42.490
Of course Bill you said very nicely the type of advocacy that your agency and your program should be pursuing and I think you've given a good insight into the problems of dealing with young people on probation and the way in which the Urban League's Youth Enrichment Program is helping. And I'd like to thank Bill Covington a Special Assistant to the Director of the Youth Enrichment Program for being our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason". Glad to have you with us Bill.

Bill Covington 00:28:11.561
