Anytime you're ready.

Speaker 2 00:00:02.540
Well, Dr. John Holliman is president of the world's largest health and hospital complex. The New York City Health and Hospital Corporation. Hear him discuss the concerns and problems of this 900 million dollar corporation on tonight's Soul of Reason.

Speaker 3 00:00:41.850
This is Soul of Reason a program that will examine the roots of the black buds soul of reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Speaker 4 00:01:08.430
With us tonight on solar reason is Dr. John Holliman president of the New York City Health and Hospital Corporation better known to his friends as Mike. Glad to have you with us tonight. Dr. Mike Holliman thank you very much for the information professor.

Speaker 5 00:01:22.070
For the invitation I should say and information we are going to share a lot of it tonight. Okay.

Speaker 4 00:01:27.090
Well, you have been appointed as president of this world's largest health and hospitals complex and as a black man you the first person first black man to hold this position and it came as a result of a lot of support in the black and other communities for your appointment. And in these first months in office you must have just have a world of things to do aside from public appearances and radio and television presentations and going around and finding out what's happening in the local hospitals. You had to sit down at that desk and then begin to unravel that mountain of paper that's involved in a 900 million dollar corporation. So what has been the thrust of your first few months in office?

Speaker 6 00:02:09.000
Well, certainly I've been concerned with the philosophy of the corporation. I'm concerned with the philosophy of health care and I'm concerned with efforts to bring about constructive change during the first few weeks and now months that I've been in the position I've been trying to do my homework. I've been trying to learn as much as I can about the corporation. I indeed have been visiting the hospitals that what I consider to be an accelerated pace and I am beginning to learn a great deal.

Speaker 7 00:02:46.410
One of my problems of course has been my initial confrontation with a deficit a serious fiscal deficit so far as our budgetary matters were concerned on day one. I was confronted with the realization that the corporation was anticipating a 55 million dollar deficit and the problems that our entail they are enormous because any reduction in spending rate somehow tends to be translated into a reduction in the level of quality or both of patient care and since our principal concern in the Health and Hospitals Corporation is the bottom line which is patient care and patient care is the reason for our existence and we must work to raise this level.

Speaker 4 00:03:39.450
Well that's certainly a major problem. It's a problem of all of our city agencies but particularly in terms of the people serving agencies it is a very very serious problem. Now exactly how many hospitals are there in the corporation?

Speaker 7 00:03:56.700
We are responsible for 19 hospitals. In addition we are responsible for a number of neighborhood family care centers and we are related to the community mental health centers. We are specifically though charged with operating something near 15000 beds. We are really concerned with ambulatory services. We have some four point seven million ambulatory visits per year. We have as we see more than two and a half million inpatients during the course of a year. We are concerned with a number of what we call patient days so that the volume and level of service is tremendous. This is what we call bulky health care. This is a very important part of the city of New York.

Speaker 4 00:04:52.140
Now the 19 hospitals include such hospitals as such hospitals James County and Metropolitan Hospital.

Speaker 7 00:04:58.710
Yes as the largest if not the largest but our city hospitals in fact I would add in other words we are the city hospitals we are the bedrock we are the basis we are the fundamental on which all health care in the city of New York ultimately rests.

Speaker 4 00:05:14.100
And that really means basically serving the poor and the lower-middle-income population. This is generally I would assume that the middle income and upper-income population tends to be served in larger numbers not totally but in larger numbers by the voluntary hospital.

Speaker 7 00:05:31.500
Yes, the voluntary system does sort of select to serve the upper middle class more perhaps than we do we were originally created to serve the poor but we have expanded our mission and I see it as serving all of New York and I think the reason we can fulfill our mission will be because we're going to raise as soon as we can. The level of care the quality of care to the point where we'll all be happy and comfortable receiving care in these facilities. This is an important new change in our philosophical thinking so far as the municipal hospitals are concerned.

Speaker 4 00:06:15.900
How does that change in your thinking is it a change of the corporation or is it a change in the thinking of the public. Because the cost as I understand it per patient between municipal hospitals and private hospitals isn't that much different in that hospital care is very very expensive for everyone all of the time.

Speaker 7 00:06:34.350
Yes, hospital care is extremely expensive but somehow we are doing what we do for a little less. In other words, we are basically making on tend to make a silk purse out of a sales here. We are going to continue our efforts to improve quality. Certainly the differences are no longer as sharp as they once were. One of the reasons that we are related through affiliation contracts to some of the medical schools and the voluntary is certainly is no longer existent because at one time the level of care in the two systems was quite different. The municipal or the system designed originally to serve the poor was somehow of less quality. It was thought but now we are approaching parity and we want to certainly deserve the parity that we have achieved. I think statistics are showing us that the services in some instances better than the service that's being given in the volunteer hospitals.

Speaker 4 00:07:41.100
And then of course because of your role in the city health picture extending through the community family care centers and through the relationships with the mental health community mental health centers that tends to give a broader health umbrella than just a hospital where people go to be treated when they're sick. Yes we are.

Speaker 7 00:08:02.610
We are not a highly specialized exclusive hospital that hospital system that separates people on the basis of their incomes. We are concerned with illness and we are concerned with giving care and we are related more closely to the community than many hospitals. We now have 19 soon to be 19 community advisory boards which relate directly to the executive directors of the various municipal hospitals as well as to the medical boards and I would certainly urge that citizens do become more concerned with this fundamental community resource. I think that the input from the community is a very valuable input and we must remember that a person is really not treated until he perceives that he has been treated and this is this is a new concept. There was a time when we all felt that doctors could only talk to doctors and this was a pure association of paramount importance but now we are beginning to recognize that patients have rights and we must respect the rights of our patients. We must be concerned with human dignity and with delivering quality service in an accessible and dignified manner. This is the basic health as a right concept that is a part of my philosophy and as you ask earlier do we need to change yes. I think that there are many philosophical changes that do have to be brought about. We have to learn that much of the health care is now paid for by third-party payers and that the old cash on the line fee for service is a vanishing phenomenon and as we bring in third-party payers we also should be able to bring in with a great deal of ease more equality in healthcare because there is the monitoring system that helps to see the quality of care that's being paid for by the third party is at an adequate standard and it should be more or less adequate and universal. They should know there should be no longer the sharp distinctions between Charity patients and private patients as has existed. We should have such a high quality of such a high quality of care that we would be all privileged or certainly be able to receive as a right now.

Speaker 4 00:10:38.030
What is the relationship between the health of hospitals corporation and your role in that cooperation and I believe it's called a Health Services Administration. More or less carries out the traditional functions of the Department of Health the running of the Center Control Services Laboratory Services the neighborhood district health centers etc... How do your two organizations relate.

Speaker 7 00:11:05.880
We are primarily in the business of delivering services hospital services and neighborhood family maybe the health services. This is the prime mission of the Health and Hospitals Corporation the Health Services Administration is slated for demolition and at the present time the Health Services Administration along with the Department of Health are being led by a Doctor Lau Belen. The Department of Health. According to the Belen plan is to regain some of its lost glory and is to be the umbrella over the other agencies other health agencies in the city. The Health Services Administration is as I said slated for demolition. As head of the Health Services Administration Dr. Belen is also the chairman of the board of the Health and Hospitals Corporation Health and Hospitals Corporation is directed by a 15 member board five of whom are ex-official members pitting the agency's commissioner dumps and Commissioner Christmas. Dr. Belen holding two positions and let me see who is the other one. Well I'll think of it in a moment. Certainly the mayor appoints directly five members and the City Council is responsible for five members.

Speaker 5 00:12:47.040
And you actually are as I understand you are the operating head of the corp right. I am your operating head I am the administrative officer.

Speaker 7 00:12:53.970
I am also a member of the board by virtue of my election by the board to the presidency of the corporation. I become the 16th member of the board.

Speaker 5 00:13:03.240
Now this would tend to suggest that in a city like New York we have the lead. Let me interrupt you.

Speaker 7 00:13:08.650
The I the other member of course is the Deputy Mayor Paul Gibson who is also appointed by Deputy Mayor.

Speaker 8 00:13:15.960
Gibson was our guest on Soul of Reason a few weeks ago and we were talking about this very issue of the dismantling of what we choose to call these super agencies. Yes. And really a basic change in philosophy as to whether certain aspects of governmental function can be better done in smaller units rather than larger units. And it is certainly true that the magnitude of the budget for example of the Health and Hospitals Corporation nine hundred million dollars indicates that when you bring these various units together and consolidate them for various purposes you do have very large budgets very large administrative staffs et cetera. For example one criticism that has been directed in the past or the Health Hospitals Corporation was it because of this large umbrella structure it was overstaffed administratively and naturally the critics would suggest that the administrative over staffing tends to lead to patient under servicing. Yet I believe one of the first things that you had to do was to establish some type of cut in your personnel across the board either through attrition and I think that's about the way in which it was done in order to at least begin to bring the corporation's budget back into balance. Now how true are the allegations that the corporation was administratively overstaffed and that in a sense these cutbacks might not necessarily tap this administrative problem but also might directly hurt patient services.

Speaker 7 00:14:48.150
Well when I was faced with the deficit I took a look at the corporation and I made certain very critical decisions without conceding any truth to the statement that we were administratively overstaffed. I elected to tried to protect patient services. And so the cuts that I instituted were not attrition per say but were a freeze across the board in hiring and a reduction of 10 percent in the central administrative staff. That was one to answer the critics and to in an effort to protect the level of patient care given in the hospitals. Now we are also caught in a Turin tremendous fiscal bind so that we are probably going to be forced if the current budget to is adopted to dispense with some programs even at the hospital levels because were they an effective 22 million dollar reduction in our spending rate we are face to face with the necessity of tightening up all across the board to achieve this base spending rate reduction. And this does pose quite a problem trying to maintain a high level of patient care. And at the same time do it for fewer dollars.

Speaker 4 00:16:13.420
Tonight on solid reason we are talking with Dr. John Holliman who is president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and we were exploring some of the problems and concerns that he has as head of this largest health and hospitals complex in the world.

Speaker 8 00:16:27.630
And as we talk about the impact of this budget crunch on the corporation and on possibly even patients what about the relationship between the hospitals and their communities. I believe that each of the hospitals has its own board. But I also I believe have heard that they are either community advisory boards or community groups who work in direct relationship with these hospitals and would appear to me that if you do have to go into cuts and services certainly the citizens in the community should be involved in making decisions about the priorities of services which ones are to be cut and which ones are to be kept.

Speaker 7 00:17:07.530
We certainly value the advice of the community advisory boards.

Speaker 6 00:17:12.819.9999999998836
We have them we think involved and we are trying to lead them in a very constructive manner. I'll work with them in a very constructive manner.

Speaker 7 00:17:24.930.0000000001164
We want appropriate input from our community advisory boards. We need this. This I think is an essential part in the governance of hospital and health care. The administrative or executive directors certainly must be responsive to their needs and we're trying to get cooperation between the three principal groups at that level. Certainly there are community differences and the people who are able to perceive these differences most are the people who receive the services and these are the people who we hope will continue to participate on our Community Advisory Boards. Certainly as we are faced with the necessity for cutting services we must also be mindful of the role that we play in getting funds. You must remember and this is important point that we are to like other city agencies we are quasi independent but we are dependent on the bureau the budget for our financing and it is necessary that in this type of an arrangement that rather than fighting among ourselves for scarce dollars and demanding that we cut some other hospital or why pick us and going through that type of an exercise which is an exercise in futility that we coalesce and that we pull together because we are a Health and Hospitals Corporation and we are currently receiving a lot less money than I feel is needed in order to raise the quality of patient services. And if we can recognize that we do need to go not only to the city but to the other funding sources and I'm thinking specifically of Medicare and Medicaid Blue Cross the private health insurance industry union health and welfare funds and I don't know whether people realize this or not but it's important to know that we are in Bursch through our state Medicaid reimbursement.

Speaker 6 00:19:27.450
And since I've been at the corporation I've succeeded in getting a 27 and a half percent rate increase reimbursement rate increase but even with the increased rate of reimbursement from Medicaid it is not enough money to meet what it costs us to deliver services. And it's not a rate which is comparable to the rate of reimbursement which is given to the voluntary hospitals.

Speaker 5 00:19:52.140
Now why is that differential rate of reimbursement between the volunteer hospitals and the municipal hospital.

Speaker 7 00:19:56.970
There are many reasons for it but certainly one of the reasons that we must overcome is a traditional belief that charity medicine was somehow supposed to be less good or of lesser quality than medicine that was formerly called private or some other type medical is the right though based on an accountant's assessment of what it actually cost to produce this.

Speaker 4 00:20:21.720
And is that differential possibly due to the fact that salaries are different between some of the municipal hospitals and the volunteer hospitals.

Speaker 7 00:20:30.960
I'd like to correct an impression because salaries in municipal hospitals across the board are lower than hot salaries in the volunteer hospitals salaries in the municipal Yeah.

Speaker 5 00:20:41.280
That was what I was yes relating to that because just the personnel alone and the volunteer hospital cost more.

Speaker 4 00:20:47.930
Right. When an accountant comes in to make an assessment of what it costs to deliver services for a patient that differential alone would suggest a different rate which would indicate that we have some other problems in terms of operating the level of salaries of our personnel.

Speaker 7 00:21:03.870
Tremendous problem. Any conceptualization that because a person happens to be poor or working in a charity institution and there is no such thing as free care. Care is paid for by somebody all across the board and the person who's carrying a bedpan and municipal hospital as caring as carrying out the same function as a person doing the same. Was there a social purpose of same social purpose in a volunteer hospital and to compensate them differently. It is to discriminate and the point that I want to make is that the municipal hospital system is a victim of discriminatory reimbursement rates all across the board. We are reimbursed at a lower rate from Blue Cross. We reimburse many times at a lower rate from the private health insurance industry and they are health and welfare funds that refuse to reimburse us at all. So this makes for many years to reimburse you at all because of the traditional belief and at one time municipal hospital services were free they were entirely supported out of the tax base. This is no longer true. We are obliged to generate the greater portion of our revenue from third party payers and as a result we do suffer from a from severe under financing.

Speaker 4 00:22:23.050
Well suppose the middle class or even an upper middle income person went to and was hospitalized in a municipal hospital. Would that person get those services free assuming that has no third party interaction most people do. But would he be responsible for paying if he didn't have a third party. Medical.

Speaker 7 00:22:43.410
This this this is an important point to remember. Every person who has served in a municipal hospital is responsible for pain. Now the sources of payment are different. Some have their care paid for by Medicare. Others by Medicaid by a third party payer. Some even pay cash dollars but the care in the municipal hospital is not free.

Speaker 9 00:23:11.610
And in order to get reimbursement we need to capture the pertinent information and we need to collect from the third party payers and one of the problems of any large bureaucracy is a collection problem and when you have large numbers of people flowing through with papers and cards and numbers and IBM IDs it does require a lot of work to recoup and to collect your money. I recall the Comptroller of the state raised a question about one of the other city agencies not I believe is the tax agency not adequately getting the taxes that they were supposed to get because they just did not have enough manpower to do that. So it is sort of a circle that if you don't have enough money you can't provide the personnel to do the administration and you can't provide the services for the people as well. Now what can the average citizen of all types in the city do to help by the corporation to help you and to help the city in general respond more effectively in terms of supporting this corporation.

Speaker 7 00:24:16.200
1 I think that the average citizen should take a great deal of pride in his municipal health and hospital corporation. I think that this is something that at least the city is concerned with providing to we should no longer look upon the health and hospitals corporation as a dumping ground a place to go when you can't go anywhere else. We are building many new facilities and the facilities and type of care that we are rendering is is improving and I would like to pay tribute to the many many workers in our system who are dedicated to their jobs and who have worked very hard to bring this about under the greatest difficulty. The voluntary system still tends to dump on us when there are no readily available financial sources of payment the voluntary system. Tradition has been very interested but when there is no finance readily available then the voluntary sort of lose interest. And I can understand that that's the way to run a successful hospital but we have a mission. We have a dedication and we are as I say the bedrock of health care in this city.

Speaker 9 00:25:25.290
We might think you're stressing is that the average citizen should develop a sense of pride and awareness of the importance of this system and I myself visited one of the hospitals metropolitan hospital two weeks ago at the health fair on a Sunday and saw the kind of things that going on the excitement both by stay up and members of the community and that's the kind of thing that I think helps to highlight to the general public the various things that are going on. But in addition the question that comes up is what does the medical profession doing in the city. To what extent are we really getting the support from our medical profession for our municipal hospitals.

Speaker 7 00:26:01.280
Well I would certainly like to get more support from the medical profession. The medical profession traditionally has been related to and has an affinity and affinity for the medical schools and for the volunteer hospitals. That's because of the ability to hospitalized their patients in these hospitals and this private patient concept that they had was not a part of the municipal hospitals. The patients in the municipal hospitals have traditionally related almost anonymously to a corporation or to a service whereas a patient in the volunteer hospital is related to an individual physician. We would like to improve service in our hospitals to such a level that every physician. I'm sorry that every patient would relate to some physician there would be a specific physician or group of physicians to whom the patient would be responsible.

Speaker 2 00:26:57.590
That's partly the concept on neighborhood family care center. I believe that this is to relate families to names of people who are physicians or nurses or what have you.

Speaker 6 00:27:07.290
You're going to try to cut out some of the in-person balloting we're going to try to really deliver a better type service through these mechanisms. The volunteers have successfully done it.

Speaker 7 00:27:21.710
The volunteers are certainly being helped to some extent through their affiliation contract. Some of them with the municipal system and if they can institute and bring the same level of care in each of these institutions and the same patient relationships then I feel they will have fulfill their affiliation contracts. Anything less than that will cause me some continued discomfort.

Speaker 4 00:27:47.210
Mike Dr. John Holliman I think you've told us and our audience tonight just how seriously you take the challenge of heading this world's largest health and hospital corporation and also highlighted the fact that New York City is doing a good job an excellent job in its municipal hospitals whereas it needs to do more needs to better need to have more money. Still I think the corporation is in good hands. In the name of Mike Holman. Thanks thanks for being our guest on tonight's solid reason. Thanks for having me.
