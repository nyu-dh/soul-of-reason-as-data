What is the National Conference on drug abuse.

Speaker 2 00:00:04.920
And how will it affect the drug problem in America. What is the role of the black professional woman in eliminating the social ills of society in the black community.

Speaker 3 00:00:14.710
Here Miss Diane Lacey discuss these questions on tonight soul of reason.

Speaker 4 00:00:39.540
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the WNBA.

Speaker 1 00:00:48.060
Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 2 00:01:06.240
With us tonight on soul of reason is Miss Diane Lacey coordinator of the National Conference on drug abuse and one of the young black professional women who is working so hard to solve some of our major social problems. Glad to have you with us tonight. Diane thank you. Glad to be here now could you begin by telling us about the National Conference on drug abuse. Is it an organization or was it just a conference. Well I hate for you to say just a conference OK that's a good direction because conferences can accomplish something although you and I both know that sometimes we do too much talking and too little action. Roscoe is a huge and historic meeting. A first time for. A group of black Spanish speaking Asian American and Native American people. Coming together to discuss a problem that.

Speaker 5 00:01:57.580
Impacts most heavily on them in this country. And it came about as a result of concern that the problem of drug addiction. Seems to be moving without the both the problem and the attempts at solutions are moving without the input of the people who are most affected by the problem so that we got together for major organizations with National.

Speaker 6 00:02:25.900
Impact. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund the National Urban League. And the Puerto Rican Bar Association of New York to convene a conference which was held in Washington in December of this past year. And what happened at this conference. Well. First of all let me just share with you our first problem. We were very anxious to bring together as many of the minority experts in this field as possible people who had either done research or had done some serious thinking on some of the broad problems. And as you can imagine there were very few. So we had to go into some of the related fields and and gather lawyers. And some psychologists and educators to put together some advance thinking and some papers on as close an assessment of the problem as possible so that we could begin to share information to begin to understand what some of the roadblocks were. And to suggest some of the strategies that we felt were necessary to begin to move forward. I might add that the people who were brought together were essentially a leadership group of people who have not been associated at all with the drug abuse problem. That is to say we didn't bring the directors of drug programs but we did bring people that we felt were leaders in the community. Or who were active in their own right who in their own right could command some attention. To to begin to. Try to understand this complex problem and to hopefully begin to use their resources along with the people who are actively involved in the field to begin to exert some force for change.

Speaker 7 00:04:35.930
Well let me ask this. I gather from the groups that were involved in this. This was essentially a minority group Third World Group. Totally. And I notice also you talked about experts who said that they weren't sufficient numbers of minority experts so you went onto related fields. Did you purposefully. Avoid including the so-called white experts in this area or were they involved in some way as well.

Speaker 8 00:05:02.500
Well there was no way to really avoid them. Roscoe we did. We wanted the best possible information. And so we. Of course included white experts as we did include white participants. But the major emphasis was to reach out to minority folks.

Speaker 7 00:05:22.330
Yeah. Because so many minority people are involved not proportionately so many but many of the people who are involved in the drug problem from minority backgrounds because of the social and other conditions that exist in our communities. But what essentially came out of the conference or did they say recognizing that problem drug abuse is still with us unfortunately will be with us for far too long. What were some of the thrust that came out of the conference including the thrust possibly for kind of permanent coalition type organization. Well. Some of the things that were identified. Probably might seem obvious to you but as we.

Speaker 8 00:06:02.530
Took a look for example at the amount of money that's being appropriated for drug programs and the decision making structure on the federal level as well as on local levels across the country and I I do want to remember to add that people came from all over the country including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

Speaker 9 00:06:23.500
How many people did you actually have participating in.

Speaker 10 00:06:26.410
We had a total of 250 registered participants. That's quite a number. Yes. And it was essentially a closed session. It wasn't reported in the press which may have been a mistake. But. Again we saw this as a very serious meeting and we wanted to get down to business and we didn't want the conference to be based on on press releases. But as I was saying the we focused on. The amount of. Resources being directed toward our community to solve this problem. Part problem. And we looked particularly we're particularly concerned about the lack of involvement of minority group people in policymaking positions in this field nationally by policy I mean policy in terms of what type of programs are going to be used to attempt to control drugs or what type of law enforcement what type across. Across the board both in terms of. Making decisions about how resources are going to be spent whether most of the money goes for law enforcement or whether or not it goes for education and prevention. The people who make decisions about the thrust for rehabilitation whether it be drug free or methadone. All the way to strategies for law enforcement and control. And we see a total absence of the minority presence in these kinds of positions.

Speaker 11 00:07:59.430
Well is this because minority people don't have the expertise or is it because there's really an actual avoidance of including them in these type of positions.

Speaker 10 00:08:09.480
I think the answer is yes to all of the above. When we raised these questions and we had some of the federal people appear. The response was We will we will. We are very anxious to find minority group people and just send us their resumes. Well we've heard that before and. We know that. These resumes have been sent and circulated many times so that we one of the reasons why we think it's important to have some follow up is to really be able to monitor the people in these positions who say they will hire if they just have qualified people.

Speaker 8 00:08:53.010
We know we have qualified people and and we just have to push forward on that point.

Speaker 11 00:08:59.630
Or what about the policies themselves.

Speaker 12 00:09:02.070
Was there any feeling about drug free programs. These are the methadone programs. Any feeling about the intensification of law enforcement. What the thrust of the conference suggest other than the obvious thrust of changing and trying to modify the social conditions that tend to produce the whole drug syndrome. Yes well this this was a conference in this with a real spirit of unity among. Groups of people who have not come together in this way for many years you know attempts at bringing various ethnic groups together have not been very successful and so we were very anxious not to polarize ourselves around some of the things that have divided us in the past. So that we did not really advance specific resolutions but there was concern about the acceleration of methadone programs and the kinds of methadone programs that essentially are exchanging one drug for another without any attempt to really effect. Change of lifestyle without any effect to put resources into a community to help. A family of a young man or woman who has become involved in drugs and we know that unless you begin to impact on that small circle around the addict. At as well as the larger circle of the community that.

Speaker 8 00:10:36.210
You're not going to have much change in the way that individual or the way that that subculture is operating. So there was a great deal of concern expressed about methadone programs that are pushing forward in that way. And of course you know we couldn't have gotten together without a sharp. Discussion about the. Proposals for heroin maintenance and you know that controversy has been raging in the city. For at least a year. It certainly was when I was in the mayor's office when an experimental program was proposed and so we had. I think very excellent discussion on both sides of the question. And. We didn't arrive at any consensus. But I think we raise the consciousness of people and gave them information which was one of the important goals of the conference. So much. On this subject. That. So much information that we have is misinformation that we have shared that we've gotten third or fourth hand. So we did have an opportunity I think with some of the experts to really exchange the most current information at that time on these subjects. We're also concerned Roscoe about the. Kind of research that's being done. The exploitative nature of it.

Speaker 7 00:12:01.800
For example an example. Well you know that whenever.

Speaker 8 00:12:09.700
The well this is a subject that this is a problem. While it's not new drug addiction has been in the black community certainly since the 1940s. But as. A subject for study. It has. Not really been that popular except I'd say in the last 10 years and it's only been in the last three or four years that there have been large research grants available and a real focus by the federal government on this problem so that people are current researchers are coming to this subject like flies. And so we see people coming in to study us. Often people who have very little understanding of the black experience or the minority experience and taking away information or using information out of context. And taking it somewhere and developing theories so that we are not we are being used in a sense and the product of that research is not being reapplied into our programs into our communities. We don't have access. One we don't have access to the information and to we have no forum to dispute or to expand on the information that's that's taken from. From that experience or that problem.

Speaker 9 00:13:36.660
This is an age old problem of research in the black community on a variety of social and educational and health problems. But the question does come up as to whether the research doesn't need to go on Debian rather to improve the quality of the interaction. Both in the planning of the research and in dissemination of its findings. Because possibly one reason why many of these projects are not reported widely is that they don't really find anything. The drug problem represents a mélange of so many different things. And as various social and psychological theories get in and try to follow a particular theory and either because of lack of knowledge of the black community or the Hispanic community or because the fact that theory doesn't hold and it don't find anything. And in the sense the amount of money has been spent and nothing has been found. But that's a truism about research in any field it's a truism about research in medicine or business or what have you. A goodly amount of money will be spent investigating leads that don't fall out. So one question I would be inclined to raise is the type of action that many organizations possibly yours are taking about monitoring research in the black community.

Speaker 12 00:14:53.360
Becoming a kind of academic censor kind of censorship of investigation and in the final analysis is that really a good thing. Well.

Speaker 13 00:15:06.740
Quite honestly Roscoe it can't be worse than what we have now. One of the things we did for the conference was We did a very careful search of the literature that has been done in this field on minority folk. And. Soon. This bibliography will be published in and available to the general public. The. You're quite right that the available body of knowledge is quite confusing it. The theories contradict. Each other. And for the most part are really not helpful. But one thing is really clear from our look at the literature that much of it is distorted by racial and ethnic bias and stereotype.

Speaker 12 00:15:58.340
So that I do give an example of that. An example of a study that does project the racial and ethnic stereotype in its findings may be a stereotype of my lifestyle or maybe a stereotype about caring about their children or stereotype about walking to work and not wanting to work. I know these stereotypes that have appeared in other studies and maybe this type of thing you're talking about in these studies.

Speaker 14 00:16:24.920
Well I really wish I had the bibliography before me so that I could point to some specifics. The one that I am trying to reach for talks. About young black males. And their desire for. For money for clothes and sharp clothes and they associate that desire for these clothes there are some implications of homosexuality. Well the black male and his interesting close and I dare say the black females interest in clothes can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. And I think those of us who know the black community would certainly not a sign that kind of an interpretation. Well that may be true on the other hand within the black community I'm sure that there are a lot of different interpretations about why some black people tend to wear clothes that are somewhat flashy.

Speaker 12 00:17:28.590
And I guess the question I'm raising. Are we upset because this was said by a white person.

Speaker 15 00:17:33.810
Are we upset because it might be the truth well I. I think our concerns go to interpretations that are made. Without the benefit.

Speaker 14 00:17:50.200
Of the understanding about the mores and the habits. And I think that a researcher who understood that. As head that is a framework and then. Came to this kind of conclusion. I wouldn't care if the person were were white. And made those kinds of conclusions. But I think the concern of this group is that people are operating with very limited information and with a lot of bias and prejudice and that that and and that theories are being advanced for solutions based on a lot of misinformation. And I think that has got to be checked.

Speaker 12 00:18:32.450
I think essentially what you're talking about is the lack of interaction between the researchers and the community and the people who are most apt to be involved in this. And this is a problem that every professional movement related to the black situation is facing now because Black has been popular recently in research studies have been funded. And because of the fact that they require technical expertise which is not present in large numbers among blacks. Many of the investigators of researchers end up to be white. And I think the point you're developing is that the acceptance that they receive both for data collection and for interpretation as a function of the extent to which they interact with the community with other investigators who might happen to be black with the. Black professionals who have some other insights into these particular behaviors. And speaking of black professionals as a. Professional black woman or whether we should say a black woman who is a professional. Different. We do observe that a number of social action movements research areas social conferences. Have considerable input from black women. And I was wondering if the particularly the young black woman brings anything to this that might be different. Than what the black male brings to it. I've. Been. Trying to think about that Roscoe and I'm not sure she does you know in our community the lines between professional and non-professional between middle class and working class.

Speaker 16 00:20:26.990
Are not as distinct as they are in other communities. So that. So many of us.

Speaker 17 00:20:36.260
Have to be concerned with the community and we maintain our connections with our own communities in ways that perhaps other groups in other words the middle class hasn't been completely able or even want to flee from the black community so that the black professional woman possibly somewhat unlike the white professional woman might be more involved in the social problems of indigenous community.

Speaker 16 00:21:09.370
Yes I think that's what I'm saying also. And I'm sure this is a basis for a whole program. The role of the black woman today and watch what she's doing what the professional woman is doing as well as the woman who is at home raising children. But I and probably don't want to go into that at this time. But. The black woman also is often in these kinds of jobs or doing these kinds of things because there aren't other opportunities. In the professional world. And so she is often doing social work and teaching. Instead of working in. Corporations or in institutions. Or on the top level of some of the major organizations. That provides her that even provide services to the black community because what you really have done is to indicate that in addition to racism the black woman also faces the sexism that exists because it's. Probably true in the white community as well that.

Speaker 17 00:22:18.880
A disproportionately larger number of professional women are involved in the helping professions rather than in the businesses or the all the sciences or such. That's very true. And in a sense it's part of what the liberation movement is about getting women more into the mainstream. There is no question that we are.

Speaker 16 00:22:37.390
To use the jargon doubly oppressed as being black both being black and women.

Speaker 12 00:22:43.050
Well as you say this is something we could talk about for our entire program. But one thing that I'd be interested in is how you as a person got into some of these. Social action programs and movements and how you have been received not only by the White but also by the black. Well. As I said before I. Have always been very interested in. I've been interested in the problems of our community and trying to. Focus myself.

Speaker 16 00:23:22.180
In the most effective way to facilitate change. And I've been interested in both education problems in health. I worked in the South Bronx. With a community group that put together one of the first programs that was truly community controlled and funded by the U.S. Public Health Service. And it was a comprehensive health program that was primarily designed by community people people without formal training and without. A great deal of experience except as consumers and the people sitting in those awful clinics. Or in doctor's offices waiting for hours. So that while they're waiting all that time they had developed some marvelous ideas about what good health care or what a good facility would be. That facility is still in operation. Yes it is. It's called the Hunts Point multi service center. And it's still providing care in a very grim area of the South Bronx. So that I've. Worked on the community level I've. I worked for Ohio for a while on the regional level trying to help communities. Develop programs that would be. Far reaching and as you know I worked in the mayor's office for a while as a mayor's liaison on drug addiction. And I did some other things with the Department of Parks Recreation and Cultural Affairs. And as a black woman. It was a it has been and I'm sure it will continue to be a struggle to get people to take me seriously too.

Speaker 18 00:25:06.100
I really don't think it's very difficult for people to take you seriously because your seriousness comes across so clearly. I think what you really are responding to to get them to move as quickly as you would like them to move on some of the ideas that you propose. Well.

Speaker 8 00:25:21.370
That's part of it. But in situations where you are working with male peers. It is often. Very difficult to get people to respond.

Speaker 9 00:25:35.380
To you in the same way they would respond to a male peer I think that's a universal problem. Professional women have in a society where they have not been a goodly number of professional women who've been interacting. Suit. Things change. I think that will move along now. One other thing very briefly you might want to mention is your interest in drama.

Speaker 12 00:25:56.020
I understand you are trying to develop a production with Woody king of one of the interesting new Black plays.

Speaker 16 00:26:03.370
Yes this is a play by Ron Milner. Very exciting young man from author from Detroit who wrote. Who's got his own play that was done in New York about two years ago in this play.

Speaker 8 00:26:15.430
Called what the wine cellars buy speaks to some of the values that I support. It has a strong anti-drug message and a strong position against the exploitation of black women.

Speaker 18 00:26:30.520
And you're trying to raise capital in order to put this right on Broadway or off Broadway off this way. And it's a difficult job because. The Broadway theater is in trouble and there aren't a lot of people who understand.

Speaker 16 00:26:48.850
The hunger of the black community for theater and for culture and that black people really will come out and support things that they think are good. Well I think with your leadership. And some of his insight and you're presenting they will begin to see this because as you say the money market is really tight in regard to the theater at this point in time because of what's been happening both in the economy and with the arts in general. But.

Speaker 18 00:27:15.700
The role that you have to play as both a social activist and someone into or not is extremely important. Do you think that you're really going to be able to get this off the boards or on the boards.

Speaker 16 00:27:26.920
Oh yes. This is a play that will be done. And. Whether we do it or someone else does it. This is a play that will be produced and I am very glad to have had a part of it to have been a part of. Trying to. Acquaint more people and to try to raise money. All right Diane you've given us a really good view of.

Speaker 18 00:27:50.020
Both the drug problem the role of the professional black woman in our society and then your new activity as a co producer of a black play. Thanks to our guest Diane Lacey coordinator of the National Conference on drug abuse for being with us tonight.
