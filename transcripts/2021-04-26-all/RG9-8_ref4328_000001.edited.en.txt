This is "Soul of Reason," a program that tells what's happening in Black America. Each week on NBC, leaders and movers in the Black community visit "Soul of Reason" to discuss important issues of concern to Blacks throughout the Americas. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Adjunct Professor of Education at New York University and President of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. And with us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Commissioner Gordon J. Davis who is Commissioner of Parks and Recreation for the city of New York. We're glad to have you as our guest tonight Commissioner.

Gordon J. Davis 00:00:37.281
Thank you Roscoe I'm delighted to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:00:39.311
Okay well Gordon as we were talking before the show, the park system in New York City is really a very pervasive one, and it's much more pervasive than most people know. So could you tell our audience a little something in the way of the statistics of the parks of New York City.

Gordon J. Davis 00:00:55.701
Well the figures on the park system in New York City are staggering. It is the largest urban park system in the world. It has been built up over a period of almost 150 years at this point. Consists of twelve percent of the land in New York City. That's approximately twenty-four thousand acres. And there are over, for example, nine hundred parks and playgrounds. There are over seven hundred playing fields ranging from softball and baseball to soccer fields. We even have some cricket areas. There are extensive tennis courts five hundred--over five hundred tennis courts. I've often said that we have not only the largest tennis court system, public tennis court system but unfortunately at times well one of the largest number of unmaintained tennis courts in the world as well but we're making some improvements in that regard. There are beaches, over eleven miles of beaches. Before the federal government created the Gateway National Park that number was almost double. They took over some of our beach area Riis Beach for example.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:02:04.492
As a matter of fact we've had Herb Cables who's the new superintendent of Gateway on our show and I personally have worked with the people of Gateway in renovating Riis Park and planning for community activities there and the South Beach and Staten Island.

Gordon J. Davis 00:02:19.611
Well they've they've got they've got some they're facing some tough issues on, in Gateway and we can talk about that, but they're trying to decide how much of a regional park it's going to be and how much of a park system that accommodates or in some instances may over accommodate some of the local communities. They're tough issues and the same issues that the New York City park system faces though and they're ones that always come up issues of use, overuse, underuse, how to get people to parks, how to get them to the park that best meets their need, but these are the kind of issues that the Park Commissioner faces every day.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:02:58.501
Now Central Park also is part of your responsibility.

Gordon J. Davis 00:03:01.790
Well they--I gave you some numbers the numbers often don't tell the whole story. The parks under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks include the beaches in the Rockaways, Orchard Beach, Manhattan Beach, Central Park, Prospect Park, Van Cortlandt Park, Flushing Meadow Park, on and on and on it goes almost every every piece of green space in New York that people think is a park is under the jurisdiction of the Parks Department. In addition there are some two million trees in the parks, and another six hundred thousand street trees that I'm responsible for. That was something I wasn't quite aware of when I took the job that I was responsible for every tree on every street in New York City but that that is in fact the case.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:03:47.030
Now Central Park itself has a fantastic history. Sometimes in reading the history of New York City you sort of forget things that have happened you take for granted a place like Central Park. But to have this particular area in the middle of the city cut out and preserved as a park area is really quite unusual.

Gordon J. Davis 00:04:04.250
It is unusual New York City was originally laid out as a grid system grid street system. Therefore you have your First Second Third avenues crossed by your numbered streets 125th Street or 72nd Street, whatever. And in the process of developing the city along this grid pattern some people with some foresight decided that there was a need in a major urban area to create a park in the center. And that was done in the 1850s, over a hundred years ago, and Central Park was laid out right in the middle of New York City. It is interestingly enough and many people do not realize this a totally man-made park. There is nothing there that was put there by nature except for some rocks. Everything else was was built and constructed. Central Park has one of the most extensive engineered water systems of any facility in the world the kind of things that people are often not aware of. That meet that presents us with some of our problems also because it is a man-made park of over eight hundred acres. It is subject to deterioration and decay and like anything that's man-made and after a hundred years it's showing some wear and tear. There's no doubt about that.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:31.070
Recently your department has been in the news because of allegations of all kinds of things related to maintenance and support of facilities relating to the workforce and particularly with our new mayor--he's not so new anymore--Ed Koch pushing for efficiency and cleaning up the city and everything being done well, the eyes of New York are on the park system and any other system that has men or women or people working, and there have been some allegations for example that the park people need kickbacks in order to fix up the field they don't do a full day's work. And of course with the assistance of the good mayor and some of his associates these things are brought right to the surface. In addition of which is one of very very few Blacks in the Koch administration you have the additional heat of having to withstand that glare. Specifically what are the realities in a situation--being an administrator myself I'm aware of the fact that much of what hits the press sometimes isn't what the real situation is. Yet as you pointed up earlier the park system is aging. We do have a budget crisis and it does raise a number of problems in terms of how do you keep the city working and how do you keep our standards of performance up--so what really is the story on the maintenance situation and your workforce?

Gordon J. Davis 00:06:57.030
Well it's true there have been allegations flying fast and furious since I arrived. They are not--fortunately they are not about this administration they are about the past administration so I accept the responsibility for bringing about change. I do not accept the responsibility for the conditions that for example the State Controller documented in a recent audit of conditions in the park system over a year ago. The situation however is a very desperate one, frankly, and most of the problems that people see in the parks and read about in the press are directly related to the ongoing fiscal crisis. The figures in the parks system are particularly brutal because the the the budget cutbacks in the Parks Department started before the fiscal crisis. They started back in '71 and '72 and '73 and long before the brunt of the fiscal crisis hit in '75. Ten years ago the Parks Department had over seven thousand full time permanent employees. In addition in the summer it had a seasonal employment budget of at least twelve million dollars and that was used to hire upwards of four, four to five thousand people in the peak seasons, the summer months. Today the Park Department is down to three thousand permanent employees. The seasonal budget is down to half of what it was eight years ago. It's down to six million dollars. Another figure along those lines is the capital budget, 1974 the Parks Department capital budget, the budget we use to repair comfort stations, build new parks, plant trees. Six years ago that budget was over seventy million dollars. Today it's twenty-two million dollars. Those figures convert into--the reality behind those figures is the reality that we all too often see in some of our parks of poor maintenance, dirty, unrepaired vandalism, and I'm trying to do a variety of things to attack those problems within the limited resources but one must begin with an understanding that the Parks Department has been more brutally cut, more brutally cut back and reduced in the amount of resources it has than any other agency in the city. One of the most staggering things about this is that as the Parks Department lost these large number of permanent employees in the last two years they've been replaced by CETA employees the federally funded Comprehensive Employment and Training Act employees. And we now in the Parks Department--to use an explosive word--have tipped. We have in the Parks Department more CETA employees now than we have permanent employees. That presents some very difficult problems, problems of training, problems of supervision, problems of skills and they're the kinds of problems that we have to address to make that workforce one, part of the overall department workforce and two, give it motivation and drive and direction in the future. It's a very difficult problem.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:10:22.240
Of course you hit on a number of things some which we've talked on other shows about the future of New York City the economic condition. A couple of things came across my mind as you were talking, and one, why Parks was singled out for this first major decrease in personnel. Is it a function of our attitude and our society to recreation and play, or is it a function of the fact that there are a lot of manual type workers toward the low end of the skill and income spectrum, and it's easy to push them off the payroll because they are not as well organized they can't provide an articulate opposition and some people don't think they're as needed, or is it an interplay of those two things?

Gordon J. Davis 00:11:05.470
I think it is more the former than the latter. I think that what happened is that when it came to decisions about how to use limited resources and where cutbacks had to occur there was a perception that Parks was somehow a luxury that Parks and Recreation was the icing on the cake if you will and not an essential service not like Sanitation or Police or Fire. So I think that's where it began. It also was accelerated by certain budgetary facts of life. It's as simple as the Parks Department employee was funded entirely out of city expense money. So if you cut a Parks Department employee for every dollar you cut you saved a dollar if you cut a HRA or a Social Service Department employee, those employees are paid one third by the federal government one third by the state one third by the city, so for every dollar you cut there you only gain thirty-three cents. So there was that kind of budgetary fact that also contributed to the, the what I call the butchering of the Parks Department that occurred before and right in the middle of the fiscal crisis. The department in terms of the employees themselves is quite well organized. They are represented by strong and very effective union, District Council 37. Lillian Roberts is one of the chief movers in that organization. So they are I think they are well represented, but they were vulnerable, vulnerable because of an attitude about parks and vulnerable because of the nature of the budget. And I think it's interesting that people I sense now are turning around on that issue that I think that people now realize that the services provided by the Parks Department are as critical as some of the essential services that--and particularly in a city that's becoming more and more a Black and Puerto Rican city, more and more a city where the majority of people are not as high up on the economic scale. Those are people who use the parks most heavily. They have few if any alternatives for recreation, for escape, and they come to the parks and use the parks in large large numbers and what they have been using and been provided the service they've been provided in the last four years just hasn't been up to standard as far as I'm concerned. There's an interesting phenomenon that I see as more and more of what we might call our inner city minority population have been using the service, it has been cut back in a way that it wasn't cut back before. I find that that unfortunate and perhaps a little bit odd. But it's it's a fact though there's no doubt about it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:13:56.101
That's one of the analogies with a lot of the services in the city, hospitals, the schools, the housing. The whole question is to what extent is the city committed to maintaining its previous standard of excellence as it goes into serving new type populations. One thing that I observed--I am a frequent user of the parks, I've been using them practically all of the time I've been living in New York City which is quite a period of time, all over the city, Queens, Brooklyn, Central Park--and I do notice that there seems to be a lot more excitement in the parks. Now some people don't like this excitement

Gordon J. Davis 00:14:35.841
[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:14:35.843
and this gets into the whole question of the argument that we had at Gateway between the environmentalists and the recreationists. Some people think that parks are places where you just go and sit and look at green grass and pretty trees

Gordon J. Davis 00:14:49.461
[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:14:49.463
and some interesting flora and fauna. On the other hand there are people who really do believe that parks are meant to be lived in and played in and sung in and danced in. And, particularly with the coming of so many more Hispanic and Caribbean people you hear a lot more music a lot more drums and so on in the park. And that raises a lot of real real questions. In addition to which recently you had probably the largest smoke-in in the history [laughter] here. People who are advocating open use of marijuana marching into the park and--

Gordon J. Davis 00:15:23.711
I want you to know I did not give them a permit for that occasion that they they didn't pay any attention to my not giving them a permit.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:15:28.641
That's very interesting because I understand that the people who live on the side of the park were were really literally smoked out [laughter] and this I believe this is the time they were shooting, what was it "Hair"?

Gordon J. Davis 00:15:41.271
"Hair".

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:15:41.273
And then they also had a parade come in at the same time. Now this causes you to face a number of problems in terms of program. Traditionally, it's been felt that the recreation type leaders in the park have not had the level of training or level of insight as some of the recreation leaders from some of the social service agencies where either they paid higher salaries or had higher requirements. What is your thought about the program responsibilities of the park? Because on the one hand you have this massive facility to maintain and develop, and the other hand as you've just pointed up you're having more and more demands placed upon the park system, not only for good clean healthy safe facilities but also for programs. And I know--

Gordon J. Davis 00:16:33.591
Well I'd--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:16:33.593
This is an area where park the park system here has been really criticized some time because of the program aspect of it.

Gordon J. Davis 00:16:40.620
I must say that the program aspect of the Park and Recreation Department the organized and and other kinds of recreation programs have been hit harder by the budget cutbacks than I think probably any aspect of city government. If the park system was viewed as the icing on the cake the recreation programs were viewed as sort of the cherry in the middle of the icing on the cake and to the extent that today we've been cut back to just barely three hundred recreation employees in the Parks Department. That presents serious issues about how the department can successfully deliver services, professionally deliver services, and to whom those services can be delivered and who they should be delivered to. Now what we are exploring one of the things I'm trying to explore is the possibility of if you will expanding the scope of responsibility of our people so that it's clear that the Parks Department no longer can entertain as its primary mission delivery recreation services on a one to one basis if you will. We will still do that but it's obvious to me that we have to look at other ways of maximizing the effectiveness of this now quite small force of people. So for example we have recently initiated a decentralized recreation program in the seven community board districts where we are giving a little extra money and attention to a recreation and to the creation of a Recreation Coordinator in those districts, a person whose charge is to attempt to bring and, to the community and make the media aware not just of what the Parks Department is doing but of all the various resources in the city for recreation. It is clear to me that the Parks Department is just one piece of the recreation service system in the city and all too often people have difficulty taking advantage of those resources because they they're not told where they are, they're not told what's being provided and so on and so on and so forth. So what we're trying to do is to have some of our better people take responsibility for coordinating on a decentralized basis the recreation services, and hopefully we will see some effect of that. It's a, it's an experiment. It's a pilot program. One we will be evaluating closely over the next year and a half as we move to a charter mandated decentralization across the board which we have to do by 1980. But those are some of the kinds of things we're doing and we really have very few options now. As I said there are only three hundred people providing these kinds of recreation services and that's just simply not enough. The day when we had a Park Department employee in every playground in the city is gone, and I don't think we'll ever see it again.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:19:34.363
Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with Gordon Davis who is Commissioner of Parks and Recreation for the city and we've been talking about some of the problems that the city faces and some of his responsibilities. And as you were talking about programs and you talk about a park worker in every park and so on, going back to the so-called good old days. One of the things that's happening throughout municipal governments all over the country is recognition that municipal governments can't be all things to all people. In addition of which that there has been and even today still is a lot of competing activity between the public sector and the private sector. As we were pointing up earlier groups like the Boys Clubs of America the PAL the Children's Aid Society the YMCA the YWCA the Girls Guides the Boys Guides, all of these groups sponsor various types of recreation programs. They are all basically supported by the private sector and they all have some very very qualified leaders. And what is happening is this development this cutback is occurring is that more and more the physical facility part of the park is gaining ascendancy in the public sector to maintain the park and the private sector is being looked to for program. What about cooperation? Maybe that's what you're talking about when you talk about these recreation coordinators--

Gordon J. Davis 00:20:59.151
Yes, that is in part what we're talking about.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:21:00.351
--to, to help develop the coordination. Now you know I once re--sat on a commission of of the community council of Greater New York where we were talking about trying to bring recreation services together. There is now as you know in New York City the state park system there is Roberto Clemente State Park right near Bronx Community College right up the Major Deegan which is run by the state. There was a plan which is somewhat in hiatus now is to build a park known as Riverbank on the West Side on top of a water sanitation station.

Gordon J. Davis 00:21:38.510
If that park is ever built it will be the most expensive park in the history of man because they ran into terrible cost overrun problems on that. It was originally a park that was proposed in conjunction with the North Water Pollution Plant and rightly so the--this was a facility that in fact no community in New York wanted it in its backyard. It ended up being placed adjacent to the Harlem community and rightly so the the leaders of that meeting demanded that they get something in return. And what they were offered in return was a major new park. But that also got hit by the fiscal crisis. And I don't know, I talk with the state every every week about their plans and directions and that's one of the matters we talk about constantly and they are now trying to devise a way of coming up with a new cost estimate for a park there. But it, it'll be some years before we before we see it. To get back to some of the things you were you were commenting on, I think you're correct that the Parks Department does have to look to the private sector--the private profit sector as well as the private nonprofit sector--for assistance in the organized organization and funding and operation of recreation programs in the city. Department is is down to the bone, and it's my hope that we can increase the maintenance of the park system, we can get our facilities back in better shape whether it be a basketball hoop in, in Harlem or a playground in, in St. Albans. If we can get our physical plan back to a standard--of if not excellence at least decent maintenance--then we, I would hope that I will be able to work with the, these other groups to bring some programming. And there are a lot of things going on in that area. It's one of most exciting things about my job is is watching the way the community groups take on this kind of responsibility with very little prodding or direction by the Parks Department. They do it by themselves they come in and fill the vacuum. One area that's where you can see that is in the St. Albans area the former hospital site there which is now being in effect run and programmed by a community group that simply refused to let that kind of opportunity pass it by and they have organized everything from football to baseball to cricket to Boy Scout troops it's it's quite impressive. And we are working very closely with them. The land was formerly federal land and now it's being passed onto our jurisdiction and we in turn are in effect leasing it to that group--will be leasing it to that group. That's the kind of cooperative effort that has to go on not just in one area but throughout the city if we're gonna have some adequate level of, of of these kinds of services. It's just a fact of life that the Department of Parks and Recreation will not have the resources in the foreseeable future to operate a extensive program, and that these kinds of groups and efforts we'll have to look to to assist us.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:24:58.013
In so my own professional capacity--cause I worked on some of these projects--I worked on the basic recreation and park design plan for the Riverbank project working with the Planning Board in Harlem. And I've also worked with PAL on the project out at St. Albans. And one of the things that I hear--because I go to dozens of community meetings as they do this type of work--one of the things I hear from the citizens, is that they really do have an antipathy to the public agencies responsible for recreation. Somehow or another they feel that these agencies aren't doing enough, that they aren't concerned. And of course as you've already alluded to unfortunately the physical maintenance of the facilities in the lower income communities does not maintain itself at the same level as at the higher income communities.

Gordon J. Davis 00:25:52.632
Oh we're trying to change some of that, I must tell you.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:25:53.930
And I'm sure, that's what I was going to ask you. What kind of things are are you as a Commissioner doing to try to bridge this gap? It's really a combination of a service gap and a credibility gap. Sometimes things aren't as bad or aren't as different as people in the lower income communities think they are but sometimes they are just as bad. So you have a question of a credibility gap on one hand and a service gap on the other hand. What are some of the things that you're trying to do in your administration to straighten this out?

Gordon J. Davis 00:26:20.320
Yeah well I think the communities have a, a legitimate beef. Let me give you an example of something that happened the first day I was on my job, which was the day of the first big snowstorm. It was an interesting welcoming ceremony for me that the heavens opened up and dropped about two feet of snow on the city of New York. And I was looking at the department's priorities just for cleaning up the snow. And over and over and over again I found that the resources first went to what you might call the higher income communities. And only after those were fixed up or cleaned up did they go to the more low income areas. I changed that. I said everybody's gonna get treated the same in the city. And this department is going to have a responsibility to assist all the communities not just some first and others second. And that's the kind of thing I'm trying to do. Not just with snow but with other kinds of services we provide. And it's again that decentralized recreation program is another example. We pick some communities where we think this kind of additional service would be most successful and we'll close some of that credibility gla--gap.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:27:25.840
Well as a Commissioner--particularly one who's appointed and all Commissioners are from the public sector from the political sector--you work with the civil service bureaucracy that's there. How do you find the interface between you as a new Commissioner and your staff and the civil service bureaucracy? How do you intend to make that bureaucracy more responsive to the needs of people?

Gordon J. Davis 00:27:47.830
Well you it's it's a twenty-four hour a day job to to take a, any bureaucracy whether it's civil service or any other

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:27:56.830
Or a university or a college.

Gordon J. Davis 00:27:57.791
I didn't want to say that but yes. It is always a struggle to make sure the people who are providing services to the public are aware that that is indeed their, their function and their purpose which is to provide service to the public not to, not some, some other mission. And so just for example recently I transferred about ten percent of the supervisors in the Parks Department because of my feeling that some of them could do a better job in other locations, people who were quite good who weren't being used fully in my judgment and other people who weren't doing such a good job and I felt a little more a little tighter supervision and they would if you will get their act together.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:28:39.580
I read about that in the press. It reminded me of the police inspectors who get moved around from one borough to the next and frequently people say when that happens well it'll take them a little while to find out exactly how things were done there [laughter]. And they fall back before, but actually what

Gordon J. Davis 00:28:53.713
You have to keep people on their toes. And that's part of what that kind of effort is about.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:28:57.622
And of course the other thing that I see is that the public needs to be even more vocal in its demand for service.

Gordon J. Davis 00:29:04.601
I can't--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:29:04.603
I don't know whether you want to hear those calls coming in

Gordon J. Davis 00:29:06.911
[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:29:06.913
but that's really what I think should be done.

Gordon J. Davis 00:29:08.371
No that's my job, I welcome.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:29:10.781
Tonight on "Soul of Reason" [laughs] we've been talking with Commissioner Gordon Davis who's Commissioner of Parks and Recreation in New York City and we've been talking about this fantastic park system we have, some of its programs some of his problems and some of the aspirations and hopes of the commission. We're glad to have had you on the show tonight, Gordon.

Gordon J. Davis 00:29:27.731
Was delighted to be here, anytime.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:29:29.681
This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for "Soul of Reason". This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University in association with NBC.
