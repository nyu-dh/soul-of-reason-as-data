Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:01.560
What is the adequacy of dental care for the black population. How many black dentists are there in the New York City area. What is being done to get more blacks and other minorities into the dental professions here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:00:13.230
Dr. Robert Boyd discussed these questions on tonight soul of reason.

Speaker 3 00:00:37.380
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute for American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:04.620.0000000000073
With us tonight on soul of reason is Dr. Robert Boyd who is associate professor of dentistry and chairman of the minority recruitment committee at the Brookdale dentists dental center for the New York University College of Dentistry and if that isn't a mouthful I don't know what is. Glad to have you with us tonight.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:01:21.511
It is a pleasure to be with you Roscoe.

00:01:23.731
OK. Very seriously.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:25.920
As you know New York University's College of Dentistry is a very significant factor in training and the recruitment of dentists in the whole New York State metropolitan area some 60 or so percent of the dentists in our city in our state have graduated from New York University and of course this makes the whole question of the adequacy of dental care for blacks and the existence and the presence of blacks in the dental profession even more important. So could we begin our discussion tonight by just considering this question about the adequacy of dental care for the black population let us say in the New York City area.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:02:05.820
Well the adequacy of the dental care for the black population would have to be considered inadequate. And the reason is that in this greater metropolitan area there are ten point six million people roughly according to the 70 census. Of the ten point six million people about 25 percent of them are of minority origin. That gives us two and a half million people roughly for the ten point six million people. There are seven thousand two hundred dentists now for the two and a half million people. There are roughly 200 dentists of minority origin.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:47.430
Now you use these figures first of all the ten point six million I usually hear of the New York City metropolitan areas being upwards of 16 or 17 million. So you must be only dealing with New York City which has seven point eight million and maybe Newark and Jersey City. That's [unintelligible]. Now then when you say that of the 7200 dentists some 200 work with 2.5 million in population what do you mean you mean in terms of whether they can pay for it or in terms of whether the offices are located in those neighborhoods or what.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:03:18.270
No what I mean is that there are available if they so desire to go to a minority dentist for the two and a half million people. There are of the 7200 dentists some. 2.8 percent that are minority which is in great disproportion to the ethnic distribution.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:38.760
You know cause you made one assumption which is interesting and I want to explore and that is that every minority person would want to or should go to a minority.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:03:46.980
No I guess I said should they wish. Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:49.351
Well yeah. But earlier you had said to serve this 2.5 million population there were only 200 dentists. And that's the reason why I asked the question in terms of whether it was where they were located and what you really meant was of the 2.5 minorities there are about 200 minority Dennis that go along with this. That's correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:08.210
And while not every minority person will want a minority dentist it is certainly true that there certainly should be a larger number just in terms of awareness of the culture and a way to embrace the needs of the populace.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:04:19.740
Very true. As a result of the. Health comprehensive manpower training Act of 1971 the federal government became aware of this acute disproportion according to ethnic distribution.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:34.050
Oh is it is it really just that or is it something that I think it's this is not what I'm trying to get to the question. I think the question here is not just whether they are minority that's whether there are any dentists. Because when you look at these inner city areas where there are large numbers of poor people most of them black and spanish but some white you find that there are very very few private dental offices and the clinics themselves are overcrowded. So it isn't just a question of having minority dentists It's a question of having dentists whether they are minority or majority. I believe your suggestion or your implication is that minority dentists might better serve minority populations and might even want more to go into those minority areas.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:05:20.291
This is very true. It's a matter largely of rapport. That you'll get a better rapport from patients a better response.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:27.930
If I could be a little facetious, dentists don't talk to the patients.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:05:32.311
The modern dentist does.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:34.531
No of course you're right. But I was again relating to the alleged idea that minorities wish to serve their people. As one of their High level priorities. Yes. And even though many minority people may have or dentist practices in other parts of the city and many also maintain offices in the inner city. But then you get into the cost question that even if you had an adequate number of minority dentists, could in fact this 2.5 million poor population afford these dentists or would they have to come through public resources.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:06:14.590
Well those that do come through public resources would still in many cases prefer to be attended by a dentist with which they would have a rapport. And in this regard there is a need for many many more dentists in the inner city dentists have been moving out of the inner city. The statistics regarding dentists for percentages of population as well as percentages according to area - in many areas of the inner city they'll be one dentists for 4000 people whereas for the average of dentists per population in America there's one dentist for every two thousand people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:57.430
But again I guess the question -

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:07:01.180
This is not now ethnically distributed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:01.187
Yeah I can see that. But is this an economic factor or is it related to as you say the absence of minorities because a minority dentist who opens up an office still has to pay his bills and has to make an income just like a majority group dentist. So is the question that you're dealing with a question of the ability of the minority and poor populations to pay. Or is it a question of the lack of people - dentists who can work let's say in clinics and health care programs in those inner cities which is the problem always of course.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:07:34.670
I think it's a matter of both. It's both a matter of the numbers of dentists that are within the inner city as well as the problem of dentists having the ability to pay the necessary fees laboratory fees and maintain an office in the inner city because the inner city office in many cases will be supported by and large by Medicaid and health service type contracts.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:04.900
So therefore as you suggest you really have two issues that you are concerned with as a black Dentist or black professor in the School of Dentistry. One, seeing that regardless of whether the service is provided by blacks or whites that there is service in the inner city.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:08:20.751
and there's an insufficient service.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:22.275
and part of that is financial and part of it is the fact that dentists have sort of flown the coop from the inner city because of the fact that they have perceived that they couldn't make as much money although now with the advent of Medicaid and some of the other approaches it is possible for dentists who can serve and relate to the population in the city to make a decent living of course and then the other question which I want to explore with you is the idea of having minority dentists as you suggest largely because they might relate or the patients might relate to them better could you develop that a little bit.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:59.770
Particularly since many of us only see dentist as people who use instruments and your mouth is open all the time and you can't talk back. What is the how does this idea of developing rapport and relationship affect the quality of dental care?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:09:14.350
Well there are some government there is some government data and there have been some reports published from the National Dental Association quarterly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:24.341
The National Dental Association is different from the American Dental Association. National Dental Association is a predominantly black dental professional association

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:09:32.771
Yes it is. now in these reports 60 percent of all the minority kids usually don't see a dentist until they're at least five or six. In many cases they are missing their first permanent molar the first permanent molar erupts that comes into the mouth behind all of the deciduous or baby teeth. So due to lack of information many times the parents feel that this is another baby tooth. By not seeing a dentist, they don't realize this. And by the time the youngster does see a practitioner it's to have the tooth removed. So in this regard there - Brookdale has had brush-ins and a preventive program to aid the minority kids in the inner city to understand the importance of brushing or flossing and of regular dental examinations and checkups.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:29.440
Now I think that's a very good point and shows what can be done through dental education. But it doesn't deal directly with the question of why you need a minority dentists who have the rapport. Or are you suggesting that the way

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:10:42.092
- well you see there are no role images for the black kids to emulate. Usually their first dental experience because of the decay is a traumatic one. It is associated with pain and with tooth loss.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:58.651
That's true for black kids and white kids alike.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:11:01.331
And in this regard the minority kid does not have the incentive whereas on the television he'll see Willis Reed you'll see Will Chamberlain. You'll see Frasier. He has something to emulate something to copy.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:16.210
You mean to be a dentist or to get dental care?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:11:19.210
We're talking right now about dental care. In getting the dental care his original response is usually a painful one and he is turned off from dentistry. He doesn't want to go back to the dentist. And in many cases for the inner city because it's a traumatic experience it in many cases is performed in less than ... I don't know how the best way so say this is.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:48.680
Ideal.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:11:49.380
Ideal circumstances and this turns off many patients.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:11:53.721
You're suggesting then that a minority dentist relating to a minority kid would make this pain a little bit more acceptable than a majority dentist relating to a minority kid.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:12:02.510
This in many cases -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:03.271
Do you really believe that?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:12:04.341
This in many cases has occurred.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:06.501
Yeah I agree but it's also true since many of us are going to dentists of a range of experience and background that some of us can go and have the same procedure done by one dentist, and not like it and have it done by another dentist and like it. So I guess again other than the obvious fact of role modeling to become a dentist. I'm raising the question as to whether the real reason why you need minority dentists is because of rapport or is the real reason because minority dentists are more apt to go into the inner city and stay there and work?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:12:40.580
This is another - a very good observation. Whereas the numbers of dentist that are needed in the inner city by and large should be the the dentists that exhibit a sensitivity to the problems of the minority people and relate to the kids.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:54.711
Regardless of whether they're white black.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:12:56.451
This is the point I'm trying to make at this point that regardless of whether the dentist that goes into the inner city is black or white or anything he should have the sensitivity that makes him aware of the needs of the minority community.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:10.071
And particularly the element of fear and the element of not going to the dentist because it's not a built in process.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:13:16.280
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:16.282
That's true. Now let's talk about the black dentist and where they get that training. Where do most of the black dentists get their training now. First of all you've talked about 200 in the, well I don't know whether they are all black, some of them maybe Puerto Rican too, Hispanic, but let us say that dentists in The National Dental Association which is primarily a minority dental professional association. All right. How many are in that particular association?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:13:39.891
In the national scene there are one hundred and twenty thousand dentists. Of the one hundred and twenty thousand it has been recorded in the most recent NDA journal but there are 2400 black or Spanish surname dentists. Now this gives you some idea as to the gross disproportion and the need for more dentists.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:05.480
And of course if you looked at the placement of these dentists geographically you'll find that a disproportionately high number are in New York, California, and Florida.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:14:14.661
That's correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:15.201
Which are nice places to work - and Michigan - more affluent places and also a goodly amount of the more high paying dentistry is done with what you'd call a prosthetic or beautifying aesthetic purpose dentistry which of course better off people can afford to pay for and then dentists will gravitate to migrate to those areas because of that. Which then highlights this need to have dentists working in the inner cities both in private offices and clinics to provide the services for those people who are there black Hispanic white elderly people many of whom are white as well. Now in terms of your particular role at New York University you are interested in recruiting more blacks and Hispanics into the New York University dental school. Could you tell us a little something about how many blacks and hispanics are in the dental school. How many have gone to the school in the past and what you're doing to try to get more into the New York University College of Dentistry.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:15:22.071
In the past 70 percent of all the minority dentists graduated from Howard and Meharry as a result of the -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:15:28.530
Now Howard and Meharry. For the uninitiated in the audience are the two black medical and dental school Howard associated at Howard University in Washington D.C. And Meharry is associated with Nashville in Nashville Tennessee.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:15:47.030
That's where 70 percent of all the minority dentists were trained in the past. As a result of this health of comprehensive health manpower training Act of 1971 a large number of the medical and dental schools started a recruitment program because the U.S. government on a federal level decided to look at the Bureau of Health manpower training. Decided that there was a great lack of minority practitioners of both medicine and dentistry. And in this regard we were given a recruiting Grant. The recruiting Grant served to identify and recruit, was objective one. Objective two was to start a fundraising drive to support the dentists that we recruited. Number three was to run a development office for overall program control.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:39.650
I'll ask this. Does not the comprehensive medical manpower Act provide funds for support of the training of minority physicians and dentists?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:16:53.541
Not specifically in in that sense through the Office of Health manpower education. However through another branch of the Office of Health manpower education and the public health service there is a forgiveness contract that if you decide to go to an area of designated need according to the public health service list of undermanned areas. You can be forgiven up to 85 percent of all the funds required that you utilize through the source of loans and student aid will be repaid by the government to you.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:32.421
I see in other words this is basically a loan program. It can be forgiven if you work in a given -

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:17:39.101
If you work in the inner city or in an area of designated need.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:43.641
now you are an associate professor of dentistry at New York University and in addition to your normal teaching clinical work which is in what field by the way?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:17:56.811
Dental materials.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:57.531
Dental materials. In addition to your work in dental materials you have the special responsibility under a grant from the federal government to recruit more minorities into the dental school and also to attempt to find funds to support them.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:18:11.841
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:12.201
Now how successful have you been. And how do you go about this recruiting process?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:18:17.830
All right. How successful have we been first in the field of fundraising. We were fortunate enough to receive from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation a large sum we received from the Jesse Smith Noyes foundation -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:31.723
Just a matter of what do you call a large sum?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:18:34.432
Sixty thousand dollars. A large sum. From the Jesse Smith Noyes Foundation one hundred thousand dollars for black and Spanish surname students to be utilized for either loans or scholarships according to their justified need. In addition to that we have some thirty three thousand dollars available in Martin Luther King scholarships and from the Cosby Kress foundation through the American fund for dental education, we have some twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty dollars available for student loans.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:07.760
It looks like about two hundred twenty five thousand dollars. Now how many students does that support?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:19:11.840
That is presently supporting a dozen students. These students have a combination of both scholarships and loans. From one of the sources and additionally for the first a first in the history of the College of Dentistry there is a black woman student in her second year a girl from Long range New Jersey I believe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:38.541
It's kind of interesting you said supports 12 students and we talk about two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars. How much is the cost of a dental education?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:19:49.731
Well presently the tuition at New York University College of Dentistry is some thirty six hundred dollars per year we're on a three year program. However instrument costs for the freshman year are some two thousand dollars or more.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:05.301
Is that right? Now how does that happen?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:20:07.070
That's because when a physician graduates he graduates with his stethoscope and his microscope and probably - he may not even have a microscope, he graduates with a stethoscope and a Diploma. Whereas when a dentist graduates he usually has all of the hand instruments and laboratory instruments that are necessary for the conduction of a practice and they are his own instruments.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:32.120
Is that required to buy them?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:20:33.801
Yes in every dental school.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:35.691
I do know of some medical schools where the medical students are required by their monitors for measuring blood pressure and the orthoscopes and odoscopes for looking at the eyes and ears and so on. So I don't think it's completely true that a physician doesn't acquire things as he goes through medical school. It's just interesting that in the stage of training particularly in the early year you would expect a dental student to acquire upwards of two thousand dollars worth of equipment that seems somewhat unreasonable in view of the fact that he's going to be working in the clinic and studying for at least another two years. Why does he have to do it in his first year.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:21:12.680
Most of these instruments are utilized because of the switch from the four year program to the three year program. Most of the instruments will be utilized in the first two - year and a half to two years. So that adds to the cost. This adds to the cost of the education because in addition to the thirty six hundred dollars in tuition and the two thousand dollars an instrument you will have living expenses.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:37.701
So what we are seeing is that entering the dental profession is a very expensive venture and because many minorities come from economically deprived or at least not affluent backgrounds there are not a large number of minorities who of their own volition would seek out dentistry and also would be able to support themselves. This is exactly points up the necessity for a special fundraising program. Now how do you go about getting young minority college graduates interested in dentistry because dentistry is not a high priority profession for even the majority population. Frequently it's suggested that dentists choose dentistry because they couldn't go into medicine. I don't necessarily believe that is the case but you do hear this particularly in your pre dental and premed. 'Well if you can't make it in med school you can get into dental school' while the requirements - You have two, you have two elements to deal with. One is the perception that the public has which I think is an erroneous perception that it is less arduous to be a dentist than to be a physician. I think it's erroneous perception but you also have the whole question of the familiarity particularly of the minority population and also the majority population with exactly what a dentist does and why it is an attractive profession other than the monetary rewards which everyone is familiar with.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:22:59.720
Well you've asked a lot of questions and the one, on the one gloss.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:04.352
You know, you're a salesman! That's part of your job to be able to answer those questions.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:23:09.231
To get more minorities into dentistry and especially to New York University College of Dentistry, in our recruitment drive we have a full time recruiter who spends much of the working week in the field visiting all of the local colleges because in this metropolitan area there are some 6000 minority students presently in attendance. This is the source of the greatest pool of black science students because when there is a mention of black science students most of the colleges of Medicine and Dentistry who have a recruitment program come to this area to recruit. So we go to all of the black science students conventions I've made it to four -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:52.170
Let me interrupt at this point because immediately you move from this pool of six thousand students down to black science students. You're going to say no other types of black students can conceive of entering dentistry?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:24:06.020
Oh of course we have a multi directional approach in our recruiting drive.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:10.760
But then you said that you focused on the science students. I agree. You focus, but what do you do with students who are not science students What do you do to reach out beyond.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:24:19.701
Yes yes yes, I understand your question to reach out beyond black science students. We have made contact with most of the black organizations on all the local college campuses. And we have brochures we have posters. We have a movie which was produced by the National Dental Association called 'What about tomorrow', which inspires, it answers questions and is a very informative movie which our recruiters take with them on any of the field trips that they make. They speak to groups that are not only student groups but also science groups. Additionally we had radio broadcasts. We've had quite a few publications. Willis Reed came to lend his support and he was made honorary captain of recruiting at Brookdale Dental Center and he himself has been out andrRequested that students who are interested in dentistry contact our minority recruiting office.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:19.990
I noticed you mentioned that you meet with the black organizations. Do you do anything with the Puerto Rican or some of the other Hispanic organizations?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:25:29.571
Two or three of these students Have made contact with us. There are one senior student, a sophomore student and one freshman student.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:40.760
Okay now when you go to do this recruiting what do you really tell these minority students to excite them and interest them in dentistry given the fact that the world is really open now to minorities in so many professions.

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:25:53.230
Well usually we say to them that the income is more than adequate if you're going to compare the income with that of Sidney Poitier or Wilt Chamberlain then no, the dentist doesn't make as much.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:05.261
Do you really start with the income?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:26:07.451
Students many times ask. That's one of the first questions well how much does a dentist make. And the answer is usually it is adequate. It is what you put into it is what you will receive from it. However in addition to that I believe that the advantage that dentistry holds over medicine is that in many cases the dentist is permitted due to his arrangement of hours and because the decisions that have to be made in a dental practitioners office are not life and death decisions as there are in a physician's office although this does occur on occasion a dentist is usually permitted the advantage of being a better family man. In other words his responsibility as a father. The physician will be called away in many cases at which time he would prefer to take his son to a football game or two. I think it is -

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:59.822
My tooth hurts I can't get you to come on the short term?

Dr. Robert Boyd 00:27:03.431
You certainly can. And I think that it would be wise that you can call my office at anytime. However when the office hours are over. Usually the dentist is not going to be called on an emergency that, that would require his denying his family as much as the physician is required to do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:26.320
We've been talking with Dr. Robert Boyd associate professor at the Brookdale Dental Center at the New York University College of Dentistry about the minority recruitment program to attract more blacks and Hispanics and other minorities into the dental profession. Those of you in the audience who are interested in following up on this should contact Dr. Boyd at the office of student recruitment at the New York University College of Dentistry at 340 East 26 Street. The phone number there is 5 9 8 3 9 6 8. That's an area code 2 1 2 5 9 8 3 9 6 8. I'm glad that we were able to talk with Dr. Boyd and learn so much more about what it takes to serve the minority populations in regard to dentistry.
