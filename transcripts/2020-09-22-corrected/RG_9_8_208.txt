Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:00:19.550
Yes, jazz is back. And Mary Lou Williams, one of the greats in jazz piano, will be with us on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:46.930
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:14.510
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Mary Lou Williams, who is one of the legendary figures in jazz and jazz piano. We know her for her work with Andy Kirk, her arrangements with Duke [Ellington] and Count [Basie], Benny Goodman, and the great Jimmy Lunsford. Glad to have you with us tonight, Mary.

Mary Lou Williams 00:01:30.741
Oh, it's a pleasure.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:32.280
Now one of the things that's happening in 1974, as we said, jazz is back---and all kind of things are happening in jazz and I was wondering: since you, in a sense, have played through as well as lived through these various golden ages of jazz and swing and bop and rock, what do you think is happening in today's music and how do you think today's music represents that trend-line of black music through the ages?

Mary Lou Williams 00:01:59.870
Well I think the black musician has lost a heritage up until this period. I had stopped playing two years ago, and a friend of mine...a priest that was going to school, a Jesuit priest, Father Peter O'Brien, you know they always go to school and they never stop...so he was in California. He come, he says, "You better come out and do something about jazz because it's disappearing." I told him, I said, "Okay, if you come back to New York and go out with me as a personal manager." So he got permission to go out as a personal manager, because several priests had asked me to start playing again. And we went in The Cookery in the Village. And during that period there was only two jazz spots open, but this poor guy he worked so very, very hard trying to bring jazz back. And what really happened through all the different styles of jazz--rock and free music--the black young musician lost the heritage...like his music hasn't got too much feeling in it. And that's the modern trend in everything. But the type of rock that James Brown and Aretha and several others I could name are playing...that's the real McCoy. That's rhythm and blues.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:20.210
It's interesting, you say that in this transition through this bop period in particular, black musicians lost some of this heritage--

Mary Lou Williams 00:03:29.680
Yes, the feeling...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:29.684
You...the feeling that's really what we're talking about--

Mary Lou Williams 00:03:32.155
Because I forgot to tell you, jazz...I can tell you that I play the history of jazz on my concerts. The history of jazz is the spirituals. Ragtime, Kansas City swing...that was very important here. That's where all the giants were born. You know like Lester, Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Count Basie and all that...it was a great era. And after that: the bop era. And after the bop era, it stopped and then it began to play free--

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:59.764
--known as rock.

Mary Lou Williams 00:04:00.890
Yes, well "rock"...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:04:00.893
That was sort of a white thing, in a sense...was it not?

Mary Lou Williams 00:04:04.970
No. Well...the black musician created rock at the Apollo Theater. That's where I heard it. And out front some of the kids that were singing in front of my house. Well what really happened--the heritage was lost through...well in other words what I want to tell you about the "rock," when the commercial world got ahold of it, it became acid rock. And most of the musicians of that type, they don't know anything about music at all. Most anybody who play it, they only know three changes, three chords.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:04:37.641
And it was, it's electronic too, you can turn up the soundsystem and you can make something come that really is not there.

Mary Lou Williams 00:04:43.010
Yes. And you see what happened to jazz, it lost the spiritual feeling that's healing to the soul. I have many people that come into the Carlyle, where I'm appearing now, and they say, "It's strange, when we listen to you play it seems like it's coming from above, and it gives us a lift in the heart," and I said to this lady I said, "Well, I'm trying hard to reach you with the love," you know. So that's what we had in the music before. And I think when a new sound comes about it would be...it'll be just as great as bop--er, rock was, you know the Dizzy Gillespie era.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:05:17.631
Well what do you think is happening though, in terms of the way in which we are trying to merge the...what you might call the blackness, the black revolution, the black evolution, and the world of the church. For example, James Brown and Aretha come out of the church. What really is happening to music? Because in a sense we're going back in nostalgia, we're going back to the "Great Gatsby" in movies, and we're going back to jazz. On the other hand you hear something like a band called the No Generation Gap Jazz Band, which means that young people are now getting into this as well. And that almost assures--at least in my mind--that there's going to be some evolution. How do you feel this will come about? I know before the show you were giving us sort of the beat lines of "rock" as against "free music" as against jazz. Now what do you think is coming out of this?

Mary Lou Williams 00:06:07.940
Well I think a good thing will come out of it later. Right now though, the Earth is kinda...is upset, everything's unsettled. But I think when it settles you will really hear something that will be very great, with a terrific feeling. And everybody I think is trying to reach something new because now is the time for it. In fact it's past due [for] another era of jazz. And I think it'll settle, maybe it'll take the end of the '70s, or in 1980 or something like that. But there's always...when there's disturbance on Earth, music and art becomes like this. Say for instance like I play Afro rhythms and all rhythms. But I do not play them with my jazz. I played them as something different, you know, a separate composition. Because you can destroy the roots of jazz playing other rhythms with it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:07:05.410
All right. Well one of the things that you've done is an album called "Music for Peace."

Mary Lou Williams 00:07:10.271
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:07:10.841
Where you bring together your own deep emotional and moral commitments and the world of jazz. And one of the songs on this album--which is very popular--is called "The Lord Says." We want to dig on that for a while.

Mary Lou Williams 00:07:25.671
Right.

Music Interlude 00:07:25.674
["Entrance Hymn: The Lord Says" plays]

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:15.540
And I think the world of music can say 'Thank you,' because that's a beautiful merging of the spiritual as it is reflected in our music and on that particular cut playing with you are Sonny Henry on guitar, Chris White on bass, Roger Glenn on flute, David Parker on drums, Abdul Rahman on conga, and I believe that's Milton Grayson on one of the vocals, along with Carl Hall and James Bailey.

Mary Lou Williams 00:09:39.421
Right.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:40.160
And that really is a beautiful merging of these things that are behind us, and as you read the liner notes on this, I can see so much of you. For example, you say "How grateful I am to all these friends for showing their friendship and dedication by contributing to this album.

Mary Lou Williams 00:09:56.451
Oh yeah, they were beautiful.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:58.252
That's a beautiful way of saying that.

Mary Lou Williams 00:09:59.112
Yes, that's something that you don't find today. There was so much love in this session because there wasn't too much money, as it's done on the Mary record label and it's a very popular mass. It's one of the great ones that I have done, I mean as far as being popular. Alvin Ailey does it as a ballet.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:18.860
You know it's very interesting that many of our creative blacks--I know Duke has been into merging religion and music--and of course our music comes out of the suffering that we have had in the world for three, four or five hundred years, so much so that some of the younger people were saying we shouldn't call it jazz. How do you relate to that particular thing because there is a problem of what you do call it--

Mary Lou Williams 00:10:42.031
Well, I don't anymore...well I don't anymore, I just play it because it's important to have it on Earth. Like in the '30s, we tried to change it to "swing," the title to "swing." It's important to play the music because...you know, I made a prediction when I was up in Rochester last year. I said, "If you'd play jazz on your radio one of my tunes or any other jazz thing, it would stop the war." Because the guy irritated me, so it was pushing me a little bit. And that's Saturday. The peace treaty was signed and everybody came to the club, they thought perhaps after that that I was psychic, but I...yeah, he pushed me a little bit too far. I was trying to say to him that people are selfish, a little bit too selfish, and we need jazz on the Earth now because it brings love to the heart.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:11:30.760
Now it's interesting, I was reading one publication on an airplane recently and it said the most popular jazz person in Europe is a deejay who created the show for Voice of America, and it's a jazz show. And when they came here they wanted to meet him so that he could take them around to see where jazz is happening, for example in New York, things are happening--

Mary Lou Williams 00:11:52.101
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:11:52.104
--with jazz in many of the clubs. And I know you have been very very well received at the Carlyle. I know a couple of years ago I was digging you at the Cookery and then The Cookery begins to turn around.

Mary Lou Williams 00:12:05.631
That's where I started.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:07.910
That's where it started. And now many of the big clubs are picking this up and we really are into a new breakthrough. But as we talk about this new breakthrough, how do you see the young musicians the young pianists coming along and many of them I know are very very well trained, classically trained in a sense, and they are exploring some new forms. Is this really an extension of jazz as you see it?

Mary Lou Williams 00:12:37.890
No, they're destroying it, they're destroying it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:39.830
I'd like to hear your points on that.

Mary Lou Williams 00:12:39.838
I have an 18 year old pianist who came to me and he studied quite well. Wonderful technique, but had no feeling in everything. So I said to him, I said, "The next time you come to the house," I said, "'You just play chords, forget your technical thing,'" because jazz...the musician said it's heavy. When I'm playing I have to...well it comes from the mind through the heart and out the fingertips. Often I know the tune that I'm gonna play, but I don't know what's gonna happen. Seems like if you get into a good spirit of it, you'll probably play something that if you record it you'd have to extract it from the record and practice and learn it. See jazz is something that comes from the mind, the heart and the fingertips and so it has to be...well in other words you learn your instrument theoretically, and then you have to teach yourself. And often if I have to write something for a symphony or anything like that I go to the library with earphones and listen. Look at scores and get an idea, and I come out and I do it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:13:43.040
That's very interesting because so many times people don't recognize the extreme technicality behind jazz. As we were talking earlier before the show, you mentioned Art Tatum was really the legendary figure who left us some years ago. And you said most of the so-called classical pianists couldn't even begin to contrive and deal with what he was dealing with. Now you, Mary Lou Williams, have played with and arranged for some of the great, great bands that we know. And I was wondering if you could reflect a little and tell us a little something about which of these you thought got into it. Both which of these you enjoyed working with, which of these you considered to be sort of the high spots of some of the work you've done in the past?

Mary Lou Williams 00:14:33.310
Well, the...Kansas City was the greatest era. That was the era of the giants, as I said before. The well-trained musician, the love and...and they never stopped until the musician really played his instrument, and they trained everyone to play it correctly, the right way of playing. And that was my greatest experience in Kansas City.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:14:55.390
Now why did...why was it Kansas City? I've often thought of that. Kansas City is sort of the geographical center of the country in one way...but why K.C.? Why didn't it happen in Chicago? Why didn't it happen in New Orleans? Why didn't it happen in Harlem?

Mary Lou Williams 00:15:09.401
Well I don't know. Everybody came to it...that's where I first met Thelonious Monk in the '30s, Lester Young...and we all would meet at a nightclub, Piney Brown's.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:21.041
Yeah, I've heard of Piney Brown's.

Mary Lou Williams 00:15:22.080
I was working with Andy Kirk, I'd work from nine to twelve, and uhm...my husband had at least four of us in the car. So he'd drop by and drop the boys off at the club and I'd drive the car to the house, change my clothes and then come back and we'd play until 7 or 8 o'clock the next day. And some of the guys would play tennis, and then we'd go to somebody's house and jam. It was so beautiful. I remember Martha Raye was--I think she was 18 years old--and she was on her way to California to make a movie. And she stayed there almost a month. She couldn't leave. It was so beautiful. And that was shortly after the crash, you know the...depression.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:03.370
The depression.

Mary Lou Williams 00:16:03.911
Yes. And nobody had any money, but yet they were happy. And it's just something I don't know why I can't just explain just what happened. But that was the greatest time of my life, and I think most of the musicians.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:21.072
Now we do know that the economics of the business sort of did in the big bands. But now we have sort of weekend big bands like Mel Jones and Thad Lewis [ed. note Dr. Brown means Mel Lewis and Thad Jones, sic.], and they are beginning...they're creating their own style, and also if you listen to them the Lewis Jones band, you hear them doing Duke or you hear them doing a Lunsford. And of course Lunsford isn't with us. And the Lunsford sound has sort of faded off in the background. Anybody who's ever heard it recognizes that it is an authentic joy, a jazz sound...and it was his sound.

Mary Lou Williams 00:16:54.132
Right.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:55.401
And the same thing is true with Andy Kirk. Occasionally if you listen to a jazz station you might hear an Andy Kirk but the smoothness, the beauty, with which many of these forms were integrated in a sense seems to have been lost. And maybe that's something that's gonna come back in this revival of jazz.

Mary Lou Williams 00:17:13.601.0000000001164
Well during that period everybody was trained to play all styles, to play...accompany everyone, you know, in theaters...and you see they were well-trained. And I think...well during that period also there was many many different styles but they all fitted. But now you have one thing goin'...either free rock or something else. And the person that has gone through all the eras playing, well...sometimes it's very discouraging to me and because it's difficult to find a bassist or someone to go along with me because most of the young musicians can't hear, and it's impossible to play jazz if you haven't got perfect pitch or relative pitch.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:17:58.481
That's very interesting. And of course that's what our program, "Soul of Reason," is about: is analyzing what's happening on the scene, whether it's music or politics or the arts. And let's go back to "Music for Peace," and listen to the cut "Communion Psalm: Our Father."

Music Interlude 00:18:40.632
["Our Father / Communion Psalm" plays]

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:19:57.991
That was Carline Ray, Randy Peyton, Christine Spencer and Eileen Gilbert on vocals, along with David Amram, Al Harewood and Lewis [sic, Leon] Atkinson. It's interesting how this album just sort of emerged. Could you tell us a little about the story of this album?

Mary Lou Williams 00:20:40.760
Well I was in Rome. I think I did the first jazz mass there, and I wanted to...in fact, a priest gave me the liturgy to write another jazz mass, and this is the one that came from the Vatican. And so I got together with my friends, some people I had known and to help me because--as I said before--there was very little money. And I had to produce myself because, uh, John Hammond with Columbia said, "Well Mary the recording companies haven't made any money off of spirituals and it's difficult to do anything about it," so I really wanted to do it. So I just bartered and then used what I had to record it. If I'd had a few more dollars I think we could have made a very good LP, but it has to be like this because we ran short of money.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:21:32.231
As it is, I think it says some very interesting things. I'd like to go back to something we were talking about before "Our Father." And that has to do with where the young musicians are coming from. For example, you said that in order to really play jazz you have to have perfect pitch...

Mary Lou Williams 00:21:46.402
--have to have perfect pitch, and a feeling. And most of our kids are playing like the commercial world musicians.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:21:55.701
Although some of the music has what the young folk would call African influences and they use a variety of types of instruments and timing and so on. And supposedly this is their reflection of the African heritage, in addition to the basic beat which we have through our spirituals.

Mary Lou Williams 00:22:16.440
Oh that was a big ride they were takin'. Because Afro rhythms cannot be played in jazz. I worked with 18 African drummers in 1946 at Carnegie Hall, and I had to switch to Afro rhythm. I cannot play jazz with calypsos, Latin American, Irish songs or anything...I have to make it jazz, because jazz has its own feeling, is the only true art in the world came out of the suffering of the early black slaves. And out of suffering a true art was born, see? So you can't get away from it--you cannot mix these rhythms. You can kill off two rhythms: Afro and American.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:22:57.350
It's like having two sine waves coming together...[both Mary Lou Williams and Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. speaking].

Mary Lou Williams 00:23:01.431
You have to...well I play all of them, but I don't put Afro rhythms in with jazz because it doesn't fit.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:23:07.460
In other words as an artist you respect each form for its own purpose, but basically you're really saying they're not the same form.

Mary Lou Williams 00:23:14.030
No, and it's destroying a great heritage.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:23:17.221
That's that's really a very interesting point. Now one of the songs that is on "Music for Peace" is called "People in Trouble." Will you tell us a little about how "People in Trouble" came about?

Mary Lou Williams 00:23:26.510
Well it was during the riots...I think I wrote that in about 15 or 20 minutes. And I was so disgusted by what was happening because it seems that the black people suffered more than anybody. And so I wrote this for them, and it's just a little thing for my friends and people that--not friends, but people should know about a little more about love, and being more sincere with each other. It's something like, "People in trouble/children in pain/too mean to care too weak to share/work so hard trying to find a brother became impatient/Now we hate each other." So that's it. That's a story.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:05.030
All right let's hear "People in Trouble."

Music Interlude 00:24:13.861
["Communion Song: People in Trouble" plays] That's a beautiful merging of the spiritual, the religious and of the relevance of social happenings...because that's really what an art form should do. And you did that in 20 minutes. Yes. Well it angered me because some cat'll come up and say, "Hi sister, hi so-and-so," and they're robbing me and whatnot so I says, "Well, maybe this will turn them around." That's really beautiful. That we should have more love, and to stick together and help one another more. That really is beautiful...and tonight we've been talking with Mary Lou Williams, who is part of this great jazz revival, and she's at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. Thanks for being our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason." Oh thank you, it's beautiful. You've been listening to "Soul of Reason," with your host the director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., and featuring a distinguished guest voicing the black experience. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Public Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University. Please join us again next week.
