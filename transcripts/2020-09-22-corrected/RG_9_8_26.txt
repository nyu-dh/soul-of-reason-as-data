This is "Soul of Reason" a program that tells what's happening in black America. I am your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University. Each week on NBC we talk with the leaders and movers of the black community on issues of concern to black New Yorkers. Our guest this evening is Richard Jordan who is divisional director of The Boys Clubs of America, a national organization that serves over one million boys. And we're glad to have you with us tonight Dick.

Richard Jordan 00:00:35.480
My pleasure, Dr. Brown.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:36.920
I should have mentioned that your division is the division of urban services and that's really where the action is both in our economy, in our schools, in our housing and in our youth services. So could you begin to fill us in in terms of just the numbers, how many boys clubs are they? How many members do you have? What percentage are in cities et cetera?

Richard Jordan 00:00:58.910
Well as you know boys clubs in America, its over a hundred years old in terms of its philosophy but at the present time we're serving approximately a million odd young peoples, primarily boys directly. We have roughly eleven hundred boys club units in the country. This includes Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and if you want to look at in terms of how we break out approximately a little better than a third of our organizations, about 350, are located in what we consider our urban centers. And these are cities with populations in excess of 100,000.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:46.102
Which does make the organization considerably urban. But beyond those cities of 100000 I imagine you must have a number of clubs in cities that are 50000, 60000. You know, it's a so-called small city.

Richard Jordan 00:02:01.351
Our 11000 org... clubs are located in cities with a minimum population of 50000 or more. So you would say that roughly 700 of our clubs are in cities of 50000 and the balance is in cities of 100000 and over. Cities less than 50000 tend not to have the financial resources to support a boys club type operation.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:30.240
What is a boys club type organization? Is it an organization that requires a facility of its own or is it an organization that uses existing facilities? Just how does the Boys Club operate.

Richard Jordan 00:02:43.821
What's interesting question if we look at the push that developed in the late 60s to developing what they call what they called at the time community based organizations. It's interesting when you look at boys clubs and you find that it is traditionally a community based organization. It develops out of interested citizens in a given community coming together and making a decision that they want to provide some specific services to youth and they generate the dollars to do that. Boys clubs require a facility because part of its philosophy and way of doing business is that they provide a sort of home away from home, an alternative residence for... for boys to come to, free to do what they like to do in a somewhat controlled situation. In a sense it's a directed candy store. It picks up from the point that boys like to be together and they like to be someplace and we create that facility and then we put people in there who are sensitive and trained to respond to their needs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:59.470
How like another organization that we talk with on "Soul Of Reason", the Police Athleti League and the one of the principal focuses, foci of the Boys Clubs of America is the prevention of delinquency and the maintenance of family structures and development of wholesomeness and so on.  One question, treatment comes up about organizations like the boys clubs is that they have good statistics in terms of preventing delinquency because they don't let the delinquents in.  How valid is that generalization?

Richard Jordan 00:04:35.460
Of course that's some bias and really without bias I would say it's not valid. I could speak from two points of view one from my youth and the other from my profession.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:47.820
Now don't tell me to Richard Jordan is a Boys Clubs of America youth.

Richard Jordan 00:04:51.990
Yeah correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:53.071
Which one?

Richard Jordan 00:04:53.941
Harlem Boys Club.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:54.480
Harlem Boys, which is one of the most famous boys clubs...

Richard Jordan 00:04:57.450
Here in Manhattan. No the boys club tends to attract youngsters who normally would not be attracted to formalise activities. They do this to Marauder ways, one the fee for membership is extremely low. So its not a preventative thing it doesn't screen kids out by cost. And the other key factor I think would be our location. 70 percent of the kids who go to boys school can walk to it. They don't need public or private transportation to reach the facility. So if you locate the facility in a densely populated part of the city where the children are and that's usually also the area of the city which is low income is the older part of the cities. You then reach the youngsters that are normally not reached by a formal type programs. And this is some of the problems that other agencies have, is their location their physical location.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:03.430
Now you use the term formal program.  Could you clarify exactly what you mean when you use the terms formal program as against what you may call an informal program?

Richard Jordan 00:06:13.360
Well I make a delineation between public recreation and what boys clubs do.  And this is somewhat confusing to some people.  The Boys Club attempts to utilize programs that boys enjoy doing as a lollipop.  That's a way of attracting them into the facility.  Once there, they attempt then to build on that interests to broaden the child's horizon, to be to get him to become involved in other things other than that which he primarily originally enjoyed doing, it might be basketball, might be boxing, might be judo, swimming, drama ,whatever that interest level the boys club tries to design a program that will attract. Once they're attract,hen we attempt then to reinforce that and broaden his options.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:06.760
Why do you want to do that? I mean what is your objective.  We talked about the delinquency prevention objective but what are some other objectives you have? Why if a kid goes to the boys club to join a basketball team? Do you want to try to get him interested in arts and crafts or in nature study or what have you?

Richard Jordan 00:07:24.910
Well it seems to bear out that one of the problems that we have in America comes out of our lifestyle.  One of the things that were once a given to only the preferred group in our society which is leisure is something now that is... that's available to everyone.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:47.140
Yeah particular because of the unemployment statistics there's a lot of leisure.

Richard Jordan 00:07:50.230
There's more leisure than we would like.  Consequently we also conclude that much of what we consider to be antisocial behavior occurs during leisure, so therefore we say that in providing a youngster what a number of options when they're young that as they become older they become a richer person to have a number of options to explore and therefore they stand a better chance of quality survival.  I qualify that with quality survivals.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:23.140
One thing I think would be very impressive for the audience is the names of some of the outstanding former boys club members every time I turn around as one that I hear about.  I guess one of the most famous is OJ Simpson the football star and just recently I saw that Sylvester Stallone who wrote and directed Rocky and acted in it was a former member of the Philadelphia Boys Club.

Richard Jordan 00:08:45.490
Yeah Rocky, he's out of the Philadelphia Boys Club and if you were to look at some of the others and there's a pretty...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:52.950
I see you have about a five page list. Just give us a few.

Richard Jordan 00:08:56.051
...a few but if we stay with entertainment and talk in terms of New York City and the Boys Clubs here like Pitt Street and Madison Square people like Billy Mays, the orchestra leader, Red Buttons, Buddy Hackett, Kojak Savalas and a very promising young pianist who's just come on the scene. I mean the acts who in fact is a product not only a product of the Boys Club but a product of our scholarship program and fine arts. Epstein Winter who two years ago won Tschaikowsky piano con... contests in Brussels and is now performing across the world. But in terms of drama and we go to sports which most people relate to we talk about Joe DiMaggio, Meadowlark from the Globetrotters, OJ., Brooks Robinson, Dill Dickey. You would go into politics you might think of someone like Clifford Alexander, Junior who is now the secretary of the army. And he came out of the old Harlem Boys Club. In fact the Harlem Boys Club is very interesting one because when you talk about communities like Harlem which people perceive to be unproductive, there are a number of productive individuals who come out of that community. And if you traced all of me you'd trace them back to a network that existed in Harlem when I was a kid. You talk about the Harlem Boys Club, Harlem YMCA, St. Phillips and St. Marks and Minisink. It was like a network of options that kids had at that time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:41.481
And well of course if there were so many options and you know so many of these clubs around why is it that so many kids say they don't have anything to do or so many kids get in trouble? Are you suggesting that maybe these are available only for the good kids in this in the town, or in the city, in the neighborhood. Why is it with all of these programs agency programs B.A.L., Boys Club, Y and so on that so many kids are hanging around a corner saying they don't have anything to do.

Richard Jordan 00:11:13.510
Dr. Brown I think a couple of things have occurred over the last 30 years. The emphasis on youth, this might sound unusual, has decreased in my opinion. Options that were existing in communities 30 years ago for youth are non-existent now for varying reasons. If you look at the educational system because of budget problems they've cut out all of their afternoon after school programs. Many of the services that were we take a specific community like Harlem that was existing then like are not existing now because of funding problems. The churches many of the key churches in these communities have moved, like industry, to the suburban community.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:05.841
Or they... if the churches haven't moved their membership has moved and the church is really dormant and stagnant because of lack of leadership and funding.

Richard Jordan 00:12:13.191
And funding. Many of the churches in the central cities are, their service population is in the suburbs and their shells. They're like absentee landlords. They are they are there physically but in terms of service. This service is basically outreach to their old community that has now moved and what happens in that switch off is that the new kids being born come up in a vacuum so that network that involuntary, voluntary network that once existed in core cities has been eroded.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:48.320
In other words you are saying that just as places like the South Bronx have been denuded of housing and jobs they've been denuded of Social Services recreation programs and the like.  Which then puts the challenge right straight up front to the Boys Club.  To what extent does a Boys Club follow this mobility out or to what extent does a Boys Club not only stay in those communities but try to develop new centers in those communities?

Richard Jordan 00:13:15.410
We place a considerable effort in what we did for quite a while in expansion, in terms of moving into new communities new depressed communities across the country. What has happened in the last five years, we have cut back on developing new Boys Clubs and emphasize trying to keep the ones in place that are in place because of the problems they're having in trying to stay in business. In the old communities in our cities.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:43.912
This really is an indictment of society. You're saying here's an organization that served over a million young people and created some of the great leaders and sports and other kind of figures you've talking about. And yet instead of being able to expand its services to the society some of them had to contract or tread water very hard to stay where they are now. This would tend to suggest to me that there should be more involvement of public moneys in this, the volunteerism is a important segment of getting service into communities. But volunteerism throughout the country has been running into increasingly more difficult times because the relative cost of volunteer agencies, an increasing at one time voluntary agencies didn't have to pay minimum wages, it didn't have to pay Social Security, didn't have to become involved in union contracts. All of these things have tended to increase the cost of social services so that I really wonder if an organization like the Boys Clubs of America can continue to say we're going to go it alone we're just gonna raise money from those dedicated rich people and middle class people who want to give money to us. What do you think about that?

Richard Jordan 00:14:54.470
A very complex question Dr. Brown.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:58.011
Very complex issue.

Richard Jordan 00:15:00.281
No we have to do. We are attempting to and I agree with you that the funding based on volunteerism has changed in our country and this has created a number of problems. One, organizations like Boys Clubs are more quasi public than they are just private organizations. What this has done, in fact, has raised a question in many people's mind. Shouldn't voluntary organizations being, be under the same guidelines as governmental agencies.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:33.171
I can think of one particular place where they can and should be. Affirmative action,

Richard Jordan 00:15:38.422
Affirmative Action

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:38.425
Title IX, women, we'll talk about that later.

Richard Jordan 00:15:42.371
Let's get to that one. But the funding picture does require a collaboration between the public and private sector. We have done a lot in this area. Bill Bricker, our national director has been probably one of the principal movers on the Washington scene in building this collaboration between the government and the private sector. This is why for the first time when the Juvenile Delinquency Act was passed and reformed, and amended in '74 it included that 20 percent of those dollars would have to be expended in the voluntary non for profit sector. This was a first. This is the first legitimate commitment of the government to recognize once, one the existence of the voluntary youth serving agencies, their effectiveness, and to do more than give them lip service providing them with dollars.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:41.020
One of the problems in dealing with problems like recreation services through public agencies is it, they frequently become sort of carbon copies of each other because of the unnecessary regulation of government funding and staffing and so on.  Voluntary agencies don't have quite that type of restriction that they can, they can and have to explore and experiment, try different approaches.  One of the places where voluntary agencies are getting hit very hard now, is in this area of affirmative action both in the area of dealing with minorities and dealing with women.  The Boys Club of America I think has what percent of their membership is minority?

Richard Jordan 00:17:28.210
Well 47 percent is non-white, nationally.  When you moved to communities over 100, 100000 the figure goes higher it's about 57 percent of the service population of a Boys Club in a Central City is non-white.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:45.180
So you do have a fairly significant track record of serving non-white minority youngsters.

Richard Jordan 00:17:50.770
That's basically because of physical location.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:52.851
And because you deal with poverty and that those are the people unfortunately were involved in poverty situation. On the other hand by definition you are a Boys Club.

Richard Jordan 00:18:02.341
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:02.731
And the Title IX amendment to the Higher Education Act clearly specifies that anytime federal moneys are spent that there should be no discrimination by sex. How is the Boys Clubs of America approaching this whole problem of the fact that it is a single sex organization.

Richard Jordan 00:18:23.101
It's a continual problem. In terms of Title IX we acquired from the legislature in Washington an amendment to that which exempted single sex youth serving organizations who traditionally provide services to one sex under the age of 19 and that included boys clubs, YMCA, YWCA, Boy Scouts, Campfire Girls, Big Brothers ,etc. But this is an ongoing question in terms of unisex versus single sex and I think that's a drain. It bothers me considerably that we are spending more and more of our time trying to deal with the legalities of delivering services to youth and not, which takes away from the time we need to spend on finding better ways to meet their needs. We're spending most of our time dealing with the right to stay in business more than doing the job.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:30.410
And this evening on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with Richard Jordan of the national staff of The Boys Clubs of America.  He is the director of the Urban Services division and Dick as you were talking about this whole business of girls and the activities on the part of the organization to justify its existence as a so-called boys organization.  Maybe you should begin to talk about the rationale, is there any rationale for an organization that would at least provide some of its activities maybe a goodly number of its activities for just one sex because other organizations like the Girls Club, the Campfire Girls, the Boy Scouts, and so on are going through this same type of problem.  Even the YMCA and the YWCA many times they have now merged so that they are in a sense a young people's association and also they have tended to diminish in part their overt emphasis on the religious aspect of the Y. But in face of the Boys Clubs of America what is the rationale that can be used in 1977 for an organization that deals essentially with boys and does not deal with that other 50 percent or 51 percent of the population of youth?

Richard Jordan 00:20:50.760
The rationale basically is still from, my point of view, is consistent with what I talked about the old Harlem community providing a series of options. We recognize ,we approach youth through what we consider a youth model, youth development model, that a child moves through varying stages stages where he deals or she deals primarily with their family and a nuclear family, that they move to a position where they they deal with people like themselves, they move to a situation where they interface with people who are different, and that these are normal growth patterns of children. And what we see in the Boys Club is that providing our emphasis on one's sex are only deals with part of the continuum.  We never articulate the feeling that single sex is the only way or the only avenue to help children develop effectively in our society.  We do say it should be one of the options, that a community should provide an opportunity for a child to have the exposure of integrated relations, unisex delivery, individual service, group services, and single sex services that these options should be available in a gated community.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:18.390
And that's really not a very persuasive argument in my opinion because the organization is taking federal money, it's providing a service. We have a society it is basically a sexist society, a disproportionate amount of the money is spent on activities for boys and for boys athletics and the world is such that men and women, boys and girls will live together, play together, go to school together, get married, raise children together, and as our family structure begins to fall apart, high divorce rates and so on, is it not possible that the perpetuation of this dichotomy between the sexes is being carried out by social organizations which is supposed to improve the quality of life and in their attempt to improve the quality of life maybe they are dealing with a 1910 or 1920 model of our society rather than a 1977 model of our society.

Richard Jordan 00:23:15.631
Possible. But from my point of view not necessarily true. I've based much of what I've been talking to at this point on contemporary data, looking at America in 1977 through 1985 and looking at a couple of other things that you pointed to. The divorce rate in our country has escalated, the breakdown of the American family especially between the ages of young families 21 to 30, is higher than it's ever been. Our society is more unisex now than it has ever been. The schools are unisex. Most of the services in the society are unisex. And so...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:00.951
When you say unisex what do you mean?

Richard Jordan 00:24:03.231
Are equal access of both individuals both sexes in the program and there is no division made between one and the other in terms of services.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:14.871
And the last bastions of those are crumbling such as a unit a one sex West Point. Now women go to West Point, they've been trained as airline pilots, they've been trained as astronauts. I think 35 percent of the freshman class is in medical school are women. So that we're moving away from that and personally I think that is ultimately desirable given the fact that women are at least 50, probably 51 percent of all of our population. And just as racial discrimination has been rampant in our society. So is sex discrimination. And I don't think that we can use past models to justify perpetuation of extreme single sex activity.

Richard Jordan 00:24:56.150
No I think what we're doing here is mixing apples and oranges. We're saying it...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:59.611
No I want to mix boys and girls.

Richard Jordan 00:25:00.951
I know at one point we're saying that because an apple and the orange both grow on trees they're the same but they're not apples and oranges do grow in the same on trees but they are not treated and respond to the environment the same. You know as behavioralist is that there are different developmental patterns of youth in relationship to adults. So to use the notion that what goes on in West Point where you're dealing with people 19 and over is consistent with what occurs with children between the ages of 7 and 15 is not compatible to me. That's mixing apples and oranges. What.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:42.620
Even though boys and girls live in the same houses go to the same schools.

Richard Jordan 00:25:45.921
That's part of the problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:47.750
Interact.

Richard Jordan 00:25:47.752
Part of the problem Roscoe, is you take a depressed community because see there are a number of variables in here, there's economics into play and there's a lifestyle and cultures. If you take a depressed community, like a community in which I grew up in, where the average household was 10 or 10 to 12 people in three bedrooms and if the house happened to be five females and three males you slept in relays and there was no place where that the boy could have an opportunity just to be himself. He was sharing everything with his sister either sleeping with his sister, the father was not in the home. They all, the influences that he was receiving in terms of what he was to perceive himself as an adult was being generated by females. And...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:40.411
Don't tell me you go run me the Moynihan theory.

Richard Jordan 00:26:42.371
No.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:42.374
...matriarchy theory.

Richard Jordan 00:26:42.933
Don't mention Moynihan to me because you know how I feel about Moynihan. I think that was a misuse of data.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:52.051
For the audience's awareness the Moynihan theory is a theory that suggests that the high degree of economic deprivation and crime in the black community is due to the fact that a larger proportion of black families are headed by women than in white families. And of course the data now have definitely refuted that in that whereas a male may not have been in the home, that many of the black families and many poor white families function along the extended family continuum where they are some influential males in the community in the family group that help them to focus and to develop.

Richard Jordan 00:27:30.840
Well you've just given element 5 of the rationale in terms of Boys Clubs emphasizing its role in dealing with males. Part of that emphasis is placed on providing a surrogate, an alternative male figure that the boy can identify to. This is equally needed for girls. It's not an either or situation.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:53.851
Given the fact we're talking about delivery of social services in this society. Isn't it possible for the organization to have both boys and girls in membership and still have activities that at one time relate more to one sex or for only one sex and at other times for them to work together? I think the...

Richard Jordan 00:28:11.901
We do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:11.902
...the concern of the government has to do with the fact that at one time girls were prohibited from membership in Boys Clubs.

Richard Jordan 00:28:18.420
Girls were never prohibited from membership in the Boys Club and I guess what...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:21.841
It's highly suggested that it's not for them.

Richard Jordan 00:28:23.911
Well that's true. Like you know the church is supposed to be open but if you're a Catholic going into a Baptist church you don't feel too comfortable. That's you know, that's that's true of just about all things.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:34.771
Hopefully we're breaking that one down too.

Richard Jordan 00:28:37.021
Yeah maybe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:37.640
...ecumenical movement.

Richard Jordan 00:28:38.821
Yeah well that only came together because they were concerned about the moon's religion and develop into recruiting young people which they couldn't. And so they came together for the first time. But it's the point of options, that people should have options and the voluntary sector has always provided those options and one of those options has been single sex and unisex and a number of other things and I think those options should be protected.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:29:03.990
In other words you are really reinforcing the idea that the Boys Club does provide a service that cuts across the entire community and is not limited only to boys.

Richard Jordan 00:29:14.551
No it is not

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:29:14.951
Any economic level or any rate or what have you.

Richard Jordan 00:29:17.550
No it is not.  We provide services to all the parts of the community but we emphasize our services to boys.  That's where our expertise lies.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:29:26.190
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Richard Jordan who is the divisional director of the Boys Clubs of America National Staff and we've been talking about the role of the boys club and helping to develop the young people of our country.  This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for "Soul of Reason". This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with NBC.
