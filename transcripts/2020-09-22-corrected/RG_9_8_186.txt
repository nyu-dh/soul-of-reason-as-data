[Piano music plays]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:33.634
That is "Abscretions" from Stanley Cowell's new solo album on Strata-East Records. Hear Stanley Cowell talk about Black music in 1974, on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:01:06.161
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:32.860
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Stanley Cowell, well-known pianist, proprietor of Strata-East Records, a man about Black music. So as we begin the show tonight, Stan, maybe we should talk about your views as to the most exciting things that are happening in the world of Black music today.

Stanley Cowell 00:01:54.021
Okay, Roscoe. In my opinion, I guess the variety is the most exciting thing. And along with that variety, and probably the reason for the right variety, is the coming to terms of our music as not just a contemporary American phenomena but recognizing the roots beyond this country. And I think I've made this statement before; we seem to be able to remember more, culturally and historically, through our music. That is, we seem to be able to get back centuries. We seem to be able to be able to even bridge the gap between our arriving in this country and our being in Africa centuries ago through music. So through this, this knowledge or this spiritual mystical knowledge if you will that's coming through music, all the various types of music--the variety, the expansion of the the form, the idiom of, the idioms of music that we're dealing with--it just seems to be exploding like the universe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:14.670
And one of the things that I've noticed as I've gone around is that there are a lot of different kinds of sound; sounds that are not the so-called typical popular music, sounds; a number of different kind of instruments

Stanley Cowell 00:03:27.981
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:27.983
African instruments, electronic instruments, a variety of types of arrangements. Now to what extent is, for example, let's say, the use of African instruments is sort of a natural outgrowth of Black music, but to what extent is let's say the use of some of the electronic instruments, something that Black musicians have brought to the world of music? To what extent is it a natural extension of the exploration of musical space?

Stanley Cowell 00:03:57.100
Well, it's. It is a very, it's a natural step. We, we have a saying that it's more fuel for the fire--the fire being that creative energy that ancestrally we were created from. And these electronic instruments that are the product of a technical logical society which we are a part of and which we help build simply new instruments for us to apply the Black experience to in sound.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:38.020
And what about some of the rhythms? I know some of the older popular musicians say that the new cats who are playing are playing these weird, weird rhythms and weird tones, yet on the other hand, I, as we listen to more and more music, we hear more and more of different sounds and tones and forms. What about that?

Stanley Cowell 00:05:00.161
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:00.163
Is that something that comes from technical training as it comes from just exploration of new ideas or is it something that comes from African heritage?

Stanley Cowell 00:05:10.030
Well, let's say that it's, there is a lot of experience, experimenting going on, and there are many more musicians that have come through academia and have been exposed to types of music that ten years ago that that sound would have been alien to so-called jazz music or so-called Afro-American music. But along with that the,we have to realize that the, the the ancestral stream has all vibrations and it all, sounds in it. And it seems like I'm being vague and staying on some kind of mystical kick by using this term.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:59.471
No, I don't think it is

Stanley Cowell 00:05:59.477
because if you really listen to-- I don't mean to be, it's a very important concept.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:02.950
If you listen to music the world over, music other than European music, if you listen to Chinese music, Indian music,

Stanley Cowell 00:06:11.010
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:11.013
Or African music, you do hear a lot of these sounds and, what you might call mystical streams, are they only mystical to us because we have heard them before?

Stanley Cowell 00:06:20.790
True.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:06:21.341
And one of the things that's happening is that through both the electronics and air travel and interaction across cultures and so on, we're getting a lot more infusion of sound and movement and space which is really what music is about.

Stanley Cowell 00:06:37.901
I also think that, in addition to the sounds, there's a certain meaning of the sounds that they have had traditionally in other cultures that we're becoming to notice and come to terms with, and that music was always a part of the religious, cultural, very basic to other cultures non-western cultures. And it had a certain spirituality. There's a saying that as a man progresses in his music, he becomes closer to God. That is because music is a universe in itself, almost, and it kind of parallel, parallels our existence.Now, you said something about certain sounds having certain meanings; I'd be interested in, you know, hearing an example of that.

Stanley Cowell 00:07:25.870
Well they can--sounds can, can relate to, to love. You can create a sound that will make people more loving to one another. And when they're in the audience; we've seen this, you know

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:38.002
You can make the sounds that make them more military,

Stanley Cowell 00:07:40.670
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:40.672
Militaristic,

Stanley Cowell 00:07:41.501
Right, right,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:41.503
right. More aggressive

Stanley Cowell 00:07:42.611
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:42.613
With more movement. I was thinking possibly

Stanley Cowell 00:07:45.430
This is scientific

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:45.433
Right.

Stanley Cowell 00:07:46.661
Use of sounds and it throws us back to our kind of witchdoctor ancestry. That is, the use of music to heal and the use of music for, well, therapy we call it today.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:01.180
Well, music and the visual arts is so much a part of our modern society. You scarcely go into a modern office building and not hear some kind of music. You scarcely go into an hotel lobby or an office lobby and not see some visual arts

Stanley Cowell 00:08:19.841
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:19.843
and much of it coming from the Black mainstream. So in one sense, this is one of the things that is happening in the world of the arts, in a theater, in the plastic arts or graphic arts and music. So much of the infusion of Black culture and African heritage. But let's take a little different tack of discussion now, let's talk about Strata-East, your record company, a record company that you and several other musicians have put together, which is really a fantastic idea. Could you tell us about the concept of the company? What you're trying to do in it, and possibly a little something about some of the things that have come out including your own new album?

Stanley Cowell 00:09:00.970
Well, Strata-East is certainly one of the most exciting things that has happened in my life, and I think it will be, it will figure more and more in the lives of musicians around the country. The concept is a kind of collective endeavor, and it involves a group of musicians, each being their own record companies in essence, but banding together under one label, and having, setting up democratically, a body to administrate that label--the actual administration of it--and it reverses the relationship between--well it eradicates--the whole relationship of producer or artist to the normal record company and it puts the onus on the producer-artist to take care of his own business and see to it that his product is technically well done and the music is what he wants. He has aesthetic it control over the music.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:10:15.210
What about the business thing? Because I know one of the big hassles in the record business is that business thing: keeping tab of your royalties, keeping tab of your distribution, keeping tabs of your manufacturing, and when so frequently artists or professionals of one type another try to get into the business end, because they are so involved in the artistic aspect of it, they sort of lose track of the other aspect. How do you handle that particularly since it's a collective venture? Do you have specialists who handle this for you, or do each one of you take a tab at one part of it?

Stanley Cowell 00:10:48.431
Well, there are specialists handling certain areas of it, but the, the artists-producers themselves always relate to the office. They come by regularly and they help in any way they can. You know, and seeing that orders go out, checking on the deejays have the albums, assisting in any way that they can. That's because everyone has an interest and it's not an individual's record that is so important to himself, it's each record in the company that the whole company is important because without the strength and the unity of the company, we would be back to, you know, 30 or 40 diverse companies again with one or two records and with no power and no marketing leverage. So, it's self help. That's, that's the key.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:46.230
I noticed you have some very exciting performers--Clifford Jordan, Charles Tolliver, Dick Griffin, Charles McKean, Gil Scott, "Zodiac" Cecil Payne--just a tremendous number of very exciting people in the New York music scene. Now you yourself have just put together an album called "Musa."

Stanley Cowell 00:12:07.220
[correcting pronunciation] "Musa."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:07.871
"Musa."

Stanley Cowell 00:12:08.611
"Musa."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:09.151
Now what does that mean?

Stanley Cowell 00:12:10.201
Well "Musa" was a name that was given to me when I was in Africa.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:14.171
Heh, that's cool.

Stanley Cowell 00:12:14.174
It's. Just an ancestral name.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:17.520
And I think you call it the "Ancestral Stream," which suggests that in your music you're trying to reflect some of our African ancestry. So let's check out one of the cuts on this album. The cut is "Traveling Man."

"Traveling Man" cut 00:12:50.650
[Instrumental music plays].

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:32.790
Okay, that's a beautiful exploration of African music, and, as you were saying as we went into the fade that was African thumb piano.

Stanley Cowell 00:14:41.270
Right. Or sanza; it has many names. That's not really their proper name. But we live in the West. I guess we call it thumb piano.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:47.982
And what is the other name?

Stanley Cowell 00:14:50.590
It's called sanza. And some places, it's called--well in the islands, they call it kalimba

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:55.411
Kalimba, I've heard of that.

Stanley Cowell 00:14:56.050
And, konde in West Africa, konde.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:00.790
That's very interesting. Those are from the various languages

Stanley Cowell 00:15:03.750
Right, right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:03.752
of the regions. But basically, this is one of the oldest instruments that is about and is used in a variety of forms of African and now Western music

Stanley Cowell 00:15:16.281
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:16.284
I've been to some symphonic presentations and I've seen, you know

Stanley Cowell 00:15:21.691
[laughs] Oh really?

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:15:22.111
Who did, does this as a Portuguese composer who composed a symphony in honor of Martin Luther King, and he uses the sanza as you call it, the thumb piano, in that presentation. Now let's talk about the music world again because the music world is not only the world of creativity but it is a world of business and our history is fraught with Black musicians being used, in a sense ripped off, in today's parlance, and then just left. Fortunately some of our musicians have gotten the due that's been accorded them. But too frequently, many Black musicians, and also some white musicians, do not get the rewards that are theirs based on their creativity. I was wondering to what extent are musicians, Black musicians in particular, beginning to earn what they deserve and should earn in terms of their market value. The market value of their work.

Stanley Cowell 00:16:32.291
Well it seems as though the, with the advent of Motown and Philadelphia International and certain companies that have a--I mean they're they're really selling Black artists--that there's a large number of Black musicians that are in the so-called mainstream of the industry. And I think they're doing better. They have, they make the right kind of use of their monies. Whereas maybe 15, 20 years ago, there weren't that many opportunities for investments. People simply let their money get eaten up by taxes or their managers took all of it. But now, it seems that the musicians are better educated as to how to protect their money and how to protect their earnings. Except for maybe a small group of musicians. I don't know how small. There's quite a few. There's a number of musicians that represent a so-called avant-garde approach. I hate that word but

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:45.572
Ahead of what the present

Stanley Cowell 00:17:47.060
Right. Right. They're not mainstream in terms of popularity, and they have very little protection because they don't usually perform in places that are protected by union rates. They don't perform in, situations where they have any legal recourse should they not get paid. The, some of the recording companies that they have dealt with, or that they compose for, you know they they don't pay the royalties. It's still the same situation for these musicians. But on the whole, I'd say that there, there is a greater body now, of musicians who are at least more aware of their legal rights and they know what they have to do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:41.410
I still have heard it said though, that the control of the music industry is out of the hands of the musician, and since the musician has to dance to the tune of the people who own the companies and on the clubs in a sense, I've heard it said, and you can check me on this, that basically it is the record business that keeps the music business moving, because there's not that much in terms of, you know, live dates. Maybe that's changing; I know in New York there certainly is a plethora of

Stanley Cowell 00:19:16.301
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:16.303
Black music around. But again, I personally don't know the economics of that.

Stanley Cowell 00:19:21.521
Yeah; right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:22.421
It really is difficult to determine this because so many of the musicians that I still know have other jobs

Stanley Cowell 00:19:28.921
[laughs] Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:28.923
And that is certainly the way it was at least when my uncle was a musician. He had one job and then he did his music at night, and we've had several of the more established older musicians on our show, and they've talked about some of the things they had to do to keep going

Stanley Cowell 00:19:45.570
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:45.572
in order to be able to play, particularly during the big band era. And as you know, the big bands literally have died out with the exception of very very few which then puts it into smaller numbers again. So what about that? What about really the economic control, in a sense, of the music business?

Stanley Cowell 00:20:03.510
Well, they as, as the musicians learn more about the industry. I think it's necessary for them to move to the next levels. There were very few Black producers of music which is the next level from being an artist. I think that Atlantic Records had, well I think, Les McCann and Roberta Flack and a number of the top artists became producers in the company, which

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:37.411
Now, and when you say producer, a producer does what? What does a producer what do?

Stanley Cowell 00:20:41.190
Well a producer is given a budget and with, well in a number of situations I guess, a producer could be on a salary and also get a piece of the record and get a royalty on the record. He also could be given a budget to produce a certain number of albums a year which his salary would come out of a number of situations. But, at any rate, it seems to be better than being an artist who gets a royalty in advance. And once you get it in advance, you're in it you're already beholden to the company and you're in debt so you might get a bill a couple years later saying that you owe the record company money because your sales did not recoup the production cost and, Promotion cost and so forth, and you advance so you will end up owing them money. You might sell a hundred thousand records, you know, and, and that's, that's happened a number of times with musicians.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:43.690
That is really rough. Now what about an A&R man? What is that particular role? Cause I know there are number of Black A&R men.

Stanley Cowell 00:21:51.780
Well that's, I think it's probably a salary position

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:55.661
Artists in repertory.

Stanley Cowell 00:21:56.731
That's it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:56.733
Yeah. Do they make the selections or are they mainly involved in the promotion of the record?

Stanley Cowell 00:22:00.550
Oh no, they, that's it. They deal with artists in repertoire and they supervise recording dates. They, they can--Their, their function can overlap with a producer. Often they can. An A&R man can also be the producer. Deals in small companies they're usually one and the same person, producer and the A&R man.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:25.380
Now let's look at Black music USA. It appears to me as I travel around the country that so much of the excitement in the Black musical world is right here in New York.

Stanley Cowell 00:22:37.950
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:37.952
At one time as you know, historically, places like Kansas City and St. Louis and New Orleans and Chicago, used to be places where there was a lot of energy in the Black music world. I've been to literally all of these places in the past, you know, few months, and I still find everybody talks about New York and everything seems to be people wanting to get to New York to deal with it. Is it true that New York is the center of the Black musical world?

Stanley Cowell 00:23:06.330
It seems to be. It seems to still be; you know, the industry is here. The marketplace is here for the rest of the country and for the world but I think that Los Angeles is increasingly

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:21.862
That's the other place.

Stanley Cowell 00:23:23.430
becoming that

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:23.432
[crosstalk] yeah the other place That's because we have both the presence of the film industry in particular the television industry. But

Stanley Cowell 00:23:28.141
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:28.143
I have noticed that a number of recording dates are held on the side of the coast.

Stanley Cowell 00:23:32.190
Well I think that rent's the backup industry. The studios pressing plants and so forth it's terribly expensive and difficult to operate those industries in this area because of the high cost of living. And I want to say one thing, that after the A&R producer level, there's also the backup industries which Blacks need to go into if they really want to get into the industry and that is pressing plants and mastering places, studios. This is another level that we have to make.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:09.830
That's a very very good point. As we come to the close of our show tonight let's turn to one of your sweet songs and it is called "Sweet Song," from Stanley Cowell's new album "Musa."

"Sweet Song" cut 00:26:28.501
[Instrumental music plays]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:28.504
That's from "Sweet Song," one of the very sweet cuts on your album, and of course in developing album, I guess you tried to work it out so that you have some uptempo and some down tempo, is

Stanley Cowell 00:26:40.292
Right. Well, in my albums I try to put something on there to reach everyone. Cause I believe that, you know, music is for everyone and if we go back to our traditional roles as musicians as we learn more and more about our history then we are, we actually have to heal people and create a situation for them to grow and become more aware.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:06.210
The thing that is so beautiful about today's Black musicians is that they do get their education, they do learn, they do get into business, and they try to take care of it. And I think it's so important, the things that you were talking about earlier for the young brothers and sisters, to know just how to get into the business and to be careful and look out for each other. Let's close the show on one of your numbers from the album "Musa," "Prayer for Peace."

"Prayer for Peace" cut 00:27:50.360
