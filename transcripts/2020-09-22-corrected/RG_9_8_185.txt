In 1973 the number of black businesses increased again...yet the number of failures increased also. There are over 100 black businesses that gross over one million dollars annually. What then is the future of black economic development? Here, Bob Martin, Director of Communications of Capital Formation Corporation, discussed these questions on tonight's "Soul of Reason.

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:25.523
"This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:13.270
With us tonight is Bob Martin, who is Director of Communications of Capital Formation Corporation. And we're going to be talking about what's happening with black business, minority enterprise and the like. And since you are with Capital Formation, I'm sure that you have your finger right on the pulse--or the non-pulse--of black business or minority business in 1974. So could you begin to sort of give us your view as to what is the present status of black businesses and minority business enterprises?

Bob Martin 00:01:46.810
Thank you for that introduction, it's a pleasure being here. I'd like to inform the listeners exactly what Capital Formation is. Capital Formation is a nonprofit organization established to create and maintain minority businesses. Our main area's concentration is the tri-state area, however we do act as consultants to firms across the country. We were established in 1968, and to date we have assisted approximately 2,300 businesses--minority businesses.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:20.050
Now when you say minority...frequently "minority" is a euphemism for black, but do you involve yourself with Puerto Ricans and people of Asian descent, American Indians, or do you really limit yourself by virtue of your scope to black businesses?

Bob Martin 00:02:37.901
Well perhaps I can best describe it as 'non-white'...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:41.781
So that covers a whole panoply...

Bob Martin 00:02:43.631
However, we do not close our doors to members of the white community who would come for assistance.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:49.902
Because there are many members of the white community who are doing business in the black or the minority community, who do need the type of expertise that a company like Capital Formation might provide.

Bob Martin 00:02:59.892
Exactly. Among some of our services, we have a business development program which was established to screen the clients, prepare loan packages, and act as a liaison between the potential entrepreneur and the financial institutions. We also have a marketing service; it's been our experience through the years that a business must have some type of marketing program, not just money, in order to be successful. We try to secure contracts for our clients who offer a vendor type of service, and in that case we also act as a liaison again between the large corporations and try to generate or get them to commit a certain percentage of their contracts to our clients.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:55.240
Now one question that someone might say, "Well, why do minorities need middlemen or people to help speak up for them, and lead them to the sources of investment capital and to the sources of contracts?" Why can't they just go out there in the street and say, "Look, I want to do this," and go to the bank and get the loan and go ahead and get the contract?

Bob Martin 00:04:17.980.0000000000291
That's a good question, and probably it really hits right on the nose of what I really want to say this evening. Black people, and basically most non-white groups, ethnic groups, they don't have generations...rather, a history of generations of business development, business uh...what's the word I'm lookin'...business experience, to look back upon. Black people in particular are now making mistakes in business. However, all surveys show that the businesses are increasing and growing in the number and dollar value. So...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:04:55.692
And also, as I said in introducing the program, as the number of businesses increase, the number of failures increase because--in our country alone, and small businesses which represent most black businesses--the failures are two out of three, and have been for many many years.

Bob Martin 00:05:11.941
Right. And one of our roles and goals is to get the white business community, make them more sensitive to the non-white business community. I think it's safe to say that other ethnic groups, as they come up in the business or economic mainstream of the company--of the country, rather--they had to make failures and learn ,you know? You learn from your failures and your experiences. So black people must have patience with themselves, not look upon themselves as failures. You know...if it don't work the first time, try it again.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:05:48.690
Now what are some of the classical mistakes that black businesses--or white businesses for that matter--make? Because as I said, generally we are talking about relatively small businesses--possibly you could put to us a dollar figure in terms of the capitalization of these businesses. But these type of businesses tend to make certain classical mistakes.

Bob Martin 00:06:09.861
Right. The type of business that we basically deal with are those...I'll say the initial funding would be somewhere between ten and fifty thousand dollars. And these are considered small businesses, and mostly...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:06:23.941
They're only small when you have the money and you find out where you have to go, and they're very large when you don't have the money.

Bob Martin 00:06:29.702
Right. You see, some of the prerequisites of going into business is to have some type of expertise in that type of business you'd wish to venture into. If you don't have that expertise, you must have someone on your staff. Some of the primary reasons businesses fail: bookkeeping, bad bookkeeping, lack of funds. In many instances, we go to the SBA--the Small Business Administration--and try to either get a loan for our client or get a loan guarantee. Which in most cases, SBA. will guarantee 90 percent of a loan if it's funded by an outside financial institution. We found that if you look at maybe a quarterly report from the SBA, they say out of 10 loans eight loans would go to non-whites--either in the form of guarantees or direct loans. However, the dollar value of those eight loans to non-whites as opposed to the loans to the white business community you might have a total of, say, ninety thousand dollars, where the two loans to the white entrepreneurs might be in areas of a hundred fifty thousand each or two hundred and fifty thousand each. And in many cases, ten thousand dollars will only open your doors and close you down. We must have more working capital. But the situation with the SBA is improving, and it's improving substantially. They're making a major effort to generate more dollar loans to non-whites.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:16.620
Now as we look at this, you pointed out that minority businesses are small, and they tend to have the usual problems that businesses have...including the age old problem of cash flow, which is enough money to pay the bills. Then I'd be interested--and I'm sure the audience would be--in terms of which kinds of areas, which kinds of...if you want to call it businesses or investment areas...tend to be the ones where there might be greater rates of success? Would this be buying and operating an apartment house? Or would it be getting a piece of land which you hope to use for some type of useful purpose...would it be a small manufacturing plant, would it be a restaurant, would it be a gasoline station? How does this go? Because this is something I'm sure that both whites and blacks are interested in, but particularly we're talking about blacks and Hispanics and other non-whites who, as you pointed out very ably, have not had the access to knowing what these opportunities are. That's one of the things we try to do on "Soul of Reason" is to open up the world of ideas to black and non-white populations.

Bob Martin 00:09:29.991
OK. One fault that's--well, I think it's a fault personally--is that we have to use the term small business. And if one really talks about the economic pulse of the country, we're talking about areas of manufacturing distribution and large volume wholesaling. In most cases, blacks are not in any great numbers into these particular areas. [They're] mostly into retailing, or selling a service--vendor-type of business.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:12.060
What, then, would be some good opportunities? Should blacks and other non-whites look toward developing a greater share of the vendor retail, or should they begin to look in terms of the manufacturing and distribution?

Bob Martin 00:10:28.980
Well we should really look at it in terms of: if we have to start small, start small. But no business...there is no business established which really expects itself to stay small, you know? I'll put it that way.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:45.601
Except mom and pop businesses, which tend to sort of generate their capital from the physical work of the family and the members of the family...and they make enough to pay their bills and to pay their rent and to take a vacation. But in terms of...the way I hear you conceptualizing business, it is to produce a profit which hopefully will grow. In other words, the profit might be to provide a service that's useful to the black community. The idea is to use this resource, this human resource, this financial capital resource, to develop a profit which ultimately will create jobs and so on. As they say, to quote the old American system...

Bob Martin 00:11:30.080
See, a lot of that has to do with the whole idea that blacks are not really informed. Even a lot of those in business, in a small business, are not really informed of ways that they could increase their own profits and grow into a major business within the community. What Capital Formation has done, we've established a 100 million-dollar minority bank deposit program. The results of that was 242 million. And these were moneys of corporations redirected into minority banks, which in turn serve minority communities. And in this way those potential entrepreneurs who needed loans were able to go to those banks that service their community and obtain whatever funds were needed.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:25.010
Well that's an interesting point, because one of things I'd heard about some minority banks is that even as a bank, these minority banks were running into trouble because they were called upon to take a larger number of small business loans--which basically are high-risk loans--and that sort of reinforces the problem. And after a while, some of our better known minority banks weren't able to give as many loans as were expected. Then the criteria for giving the loans became even more stringent than what you might call the "downtown" or the predominantly white banks. How do you...how does one get around that kind of problem? Because that is really an interesting problem at the...it's almost like having a minority mayor in a town that's 50/50. The blacks expect, or the minorities expect, more of the minority mayor than they would of a white person in a similar position; we expect more of our black banks than we would of white banks. Yet given the fact that small businesses tend to have a certain element of risk in them, if the minority banks go too much in terms of small business loans or even mortgage loans on properties that are not particularly well developed, they are in a spot...because if banks get too many defaults, bank's out of business.

Bob Martin 00:13:51.590
Mm-hm. Well see up until 1970, just before we started our minority bank deposit program, minority banks had less than one percent of the national assets. However they lent out 30 percent of the loans to minorities. So you see right there there is an imbalance...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:14:13.980
That's the point we were talking about, exactly.

Bob Martin 00:14:14.991
Right. Since that time, minority businesses and the banks...you see, the community looks on banks--especially minority banks--as, "Wow, you know, like...OK you're black, you're here to serve us, therefore we want you to do A B and C. And sometimes this this A, B, and C will not be the same type of thing that a majority bank would lend money towards. So you know you're asking them not to be bankers. You ask them just to lend you money.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:14:50.153
Of course, that's bad business.

Bob Martin 00:14:52.521
Right. The community has to become a little more sensitive to the whole operation of banking. You know they have to understand what banking is and understand why banks do lend loans. Now at the same time, the minority banks will have to be sensitive to the community and say, "Well there's..." you know...I don't think...I don't believe any great money has been made unless there was some type of risk." So they have to become more sensitive to the members of the minority community and say, well, looks like it has a chance. Yeah, and if it looks like it has a chance and--maybe not the greatest chance--but if it looks like it might make money and be in the green in a couple of years or whatever, according to the size of the business, I think they should go ahead and support those who have a desire, or as we like to say, the entrepreneurial juices.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:47.162
However it is a problem, because business tends to be cyclical like everything else. And I know a few years ago there was a lot of movement to get blacks in particular to invest in fast food. And some of those franchises have changed hands three times, in even the same location. It could be alleged that that's due to poor management, but also could be alleged that that's due to the fact that these just are not businesses that are going to produce a large amount of profit in one particular location, and therefore for an individual or corporation to get locked up in one particular spot like that might not be the best choice of business or business location. In your view--and I know you don't speak totally for Capital Formation, but in some ways in terms of some of the experts of Capital Formation--how do you view, how does Capital Formation view, the areas that blacks probably, and Puerto Ricans and other nonwhites probably, ought to be getting into as they begin to develop this? Should a person take an area where he or she is skilled--let's say he's a photographer or let's say he's a mechanic--and go into that? Or should a person look around and say, "Well look, here's a service or here's a product, it's needed, I can figure out some way of delivering this product." Let's just be as crazy as something that says, "Here's a service that will pick up your fur coat and deliver it to the storage place and bring it back." I'm just making up a business. And you'd have to evaluate that, and you probably don't evaluate just on the basis of that particular instance but on the basis of that class of business. Is that class of business one that's apt to be successful? So...what I'm asking is what kind of class of businesses do you feel some of the Capital Formation experts feel is, or are, the best classes of business for minorities to try to get into?

Bob Martin 00:17:53.971
Well the best class of business is any type of business that there's a market for. Demand creates businesses, really. Unless you are someone in the area of--let's say inventions, we have a few clients who might invent a little gadget then they would want to mass produce it, but have it...not copywritten, but...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:22.111
Have it trademarked?

Bob Martin 00:18:24.821
Trademarked, that type of...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:25.950
Get a patent on it.

Bob Martin 00:18:26.821
If some of these gadgets that the government might want to use...in this case they would need a very large, substantial loan to sustain the business. You know, through that maybe first year of manufacturing. And I find that manufacturing and distribution are really those areas which tap on the mainstream of the country, economic nation country. However, we do not discourage anyone from going into retailing, or wholesaling.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:19:00.510
What about prior expertise? Does manufacturing require a large amount of prior expertise than retailing? Or is it something that really follows certain basic principles?

Bob Martin 00:19:14.761
This follows basic..this follows basic principles. You should know your business, and knowing your business...if you don't have expertise in marketing your business, you hire somebody. Capital Formation has a volunteer program. And we have over thirteen hundred volunteers on our list. And these volunteers are from major corporations and businesses which are successful, which are very large. They include accountants, public relations people, advertising consultants and they volunteer a couple hours of their time--some even more--to our minority entrepreneurs. And we try to create a one on one basis between the volunteer and the entrepreneur. The volunteers can fill them in on the do's and don'ts of their particular type of business. We find that when you erase a great amount of risk, the business is more likely to succeed.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:20:17.551
The less risk there is in the business, provided there's a market for that particular product, the more apt a business is to succeed. Speaking of that, if some of our listeners wanted to get in touch with Capital Formation, either for advice or to volunteer their help, how would they get in touch with Capital Formation?

Bob Martin 00:20:36.360
Okay, we have two offices. Our major office or main offices downtown in the City Hall area, is 5 Beekman Street, New York City. 138, that's the mailing address, and our telephone number down there is 791-9200. That's 791-9200. We also have an uptown office located in the Harlem Commonwealth building on 125th Street. And that address is 215 West 125th Street. Phone number there is 222-9650. That's 222-9650.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:21:14.060
OK I think that's very important, Bob. We're talking with Bob Martin, who is Director of Communications for Capital Formation Corporation, because many people have questions about business and many people want to volunteer their help. Now you talked about marketing, and that's such a key word as I hear you talk. You've talked about bookkeeping, that's finding where the money is, and marketing. And I guess that's what you call finding out where the customer is. What are some of the skills that minority people in particular need to develop in the area of marketing that probably they don't have now as well as they should?

Bob Martin 00:21:49.821
Well. As a result of the civil rights movement and subsequent movements like the Black Nationalist Movement, Unity, you know...your major corporations have, you know, almost virtually pulled Blacks into their organization and said, "What do...what will the black people buy?" You know, "What type of market is out there?"

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:22:16.581
How do you promote it?

Bob Martin 00:22:17.690
How do you promote it...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:22:17.873
What kind of advertising do you use...

Bob Martin 00:22:19.610
Should we use, you know..."That's Cool," or should we use words such as, you know, "out of sight" and all that type of thing. It's a whole development thing. So they've called on blacks who had interests you know these type of areas and...they've been trying to tap on the black buying market, see? So now what we do is, we try to not only tap on the black buying market, but to tap on the white buying market. Because I think it's safe to say that the spending power of blacks is tremendous across the country. However...I don't like to really use the word success, because sometimes people use the word 'success,' they don't produce anymore. They become unproductive. But to be a successful type of business, you must tap on every market available, see? So that's what we try to do ,and procure contracts, and in many cases the contractor must be sensitive to the minority supplier and not give him what's so-called as a token job. Because many times, the minority supplier's out there to develop a track record. And he will do a job maybe for less money--it might cost him money to do it--and he might lose on, you know, just developing a good product or supplying a good service to the contractor. And if this continues on an ongoing basis, he will continue to lose money. And that's one of the problems we have today.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:10.240
Well now if there's any one marketing skill that minority businesses should look for, what would that be? Would it be identifying where potential clients might be, or would it be in the area of promotion?

Bob Martin 00:24:27.950
Well, I would say it might have to be both of them. Because you have to have your market--rather, your product should be geared to a particular market or markets. It wouldn't make any sense to set up a restaurant in a place that's not populated.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:46.010
Or in a place where people can't afford the prices that you're charging.

Bob Martin 00:24:48.830
Right. So you know all this goes into the whole loan packaging service that we provide.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:56.790
Now when you say that goes into--that's a very important point. When you say it goes into your loan packaging...as I would read you, you're saying that before you provide a loan, you want the people who are trying to get the loan to either make some of these judgments about their marketing or at the very least get some help, which will help them to make these judgments.

Bob Martin 00:25:18.670
Right. And in many cases we'll do it ourselves. If we feel that a client may want to operate a business in a certain locale and we don't feel that he would be able to profit at his best, we might do our own survey. We also work with other business development organizations like ICBO Brooklyn Local Economic Development Corporation, South Bronx Overall Development Corporation, many others...

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:25:46.611
Do sometimes you put together larger packages?

Bob Martin 00:25:51.290
Well...sometimes, yes. But in this way you know we're able to exchange ideas and really operate on a larger scale. I'd like to say one thing. Capital Formation has developed two communication vehicles. And in this way we inform people about different areas of economic development. And no matter what the issue is, it usually ties back into economics. And we have a radio show which comes on...can I announce it on this station? OK, we have a radio show which comes on 10:30, Saturday nights. Called "A Piece on the Action," hosted by Dick Kennard, Capital Formation's president. And we also have a teleprompter show which is also shown on Sterling, called "On the Case."

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:26:39.491
That's one of the public access channels?

Bob Martin 00:26:41.931
Right, it's on Channel C, Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. and the following Thursday at 3:00 p.m.. And...this is one of our major efforts to let the people know that we are out here. We're here to assist them. The services are free. And all they have to do, if they have a desire to go into business, call us. Call us. We're not a lending institution. However we provide the managerial and technical expertise.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:11.960
Now what about the idea of the fact that blacks have more political power? Does that really help black businesses, as you see it?

Bob Martin 00:27:19.360
Well that's a definite yes. However speaking, you know, personally, I think that blacks should really address themselves to not only a more...not only a stronger political bloc here, but also deal with the politics of uniting Africa. Other ethnic groups in a smaller minority, they can demand certain things from the government, and if blacks address themselves to a pan-Africanist type idea, they can do the same thing and we wouldn't have to go through so many changes in order to...go through a lot of changes, just to do a little.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:59.090
I think that's a good point on which to close our program, because you're relating the overall development of black people throughout the world to economic development. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Bob Martin, who is Director of Communications of Capital Formation Corporation. Thanks for being our guest tonight, Bob.

Bob Martin 00:28:16.131
Thank you, Dr. Brown.
