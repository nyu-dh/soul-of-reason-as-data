This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:00:49.330
Throughout the summer the Brooklyn Museum on Eastern Parkway is presenting two centuries of Black American Art, an exhibition of significant Black painting and sculpture, over the past 200 years. Tonight on " Soul of Reason" we'll be talking with John Rhoden, sculptor, Romare Bearden, artist, and Larry Wilson of the Philip Morris Inc., who is helping to sponsor and promote this significant exhibit of Black American art. I'm glad to have you gentlemen with us this evening. And to begin the discussion this evening could you tell us, Romi, what the real significance of this excellent presentation of two centuries of Black American art is.

Romare Bearden 00:01:35.020
When I was, uh, wanted to be an artist as a young man, I went to a meeting organized by Aaron Douglas, and a group was formed called the Harlem Artists Guild. And I was surprised to see about 65 or 70 artists there, because I had no idea there were that many Black artists interested in forming such an organization. And I knew nothing of Tanner, I had no idea of, uh, Duncanson, or any of the past history of what Afro-Americans had done in this country. And I think the same is not as true as when I came along in the 30s, but significantly a lot of the same, a lack of knowledge is apparent today. And I think this exhibit, which is traveling throughout the country will do much to alleviate this, and to show people of that the Afro-American Artist has indeed contributed to the American cultural experiences, as long as have been this country.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:02:56.024
Now Larry, as the business and corporate relations person for Philip Morris Incorporated, you undoubtedly must have had a lot to do with Philip Morris becoming sponsors of this exhibit. One thing we might mention is that David Driscoll, who is a professor of Art at the University of Maryland, is curator of the exhibit, but he's not able to be with us this evening, and he has done an outstanding job of pulling the pieces together, making and developing the collection, and preparing the catalog. But Larry, could you tell us how Philip Morris got interested, why they're interested, and what they're trying to do in their sponsorship of this significant exhibit.

Larry Wilson 00:03:33.701
Well, Philip Morris has been involved in the arts for quite some time. I think it goes back to, oh, probably 15 years ago. We felt a real commitment to the arts, we feel that good art is good business, as George Weisman, our Vice Chairman has said. We tend to look at shows we tend to try to get involved in shows that, uh, speak about the American people and the different cultures that make up the American, the American people. We've sponsored shows to talk about the American Indian, shows that talk about the pioneer in the frontier in the far West, shows to talk about the women of the Revolutionary War period, and now this show, 200 years of Black American art. I think what Romare says about contribution, I think contribution is really the key word here. Black people really have made a significant contribution, not only to our society but to the art of America. And that's what this show says, and so we're very proud that we're, we're involved in it. It's a unique show it had to our knowledge nothing like this, of this caliber, has been done before.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:52.601
All right now in terms of uh sponsorship, does the sponsorship entail buying the art, or does it just entail preparing the catalog and seeing that it is properly mounted and the curators is hired, or did you actually go out and purchase the art for the show.

Larry Wilson 00:05:11.620
No, no we didn't go out and purchase the art. Instead what we did was in, in conjunction with the National Endowment for the Humanities, offer a grant to, to this show so that David Driscoll could collect the works, so that the catalog could be put together, so that a film is talking about two centuries of Black American art could be made. And that was one hundred twenty five thousand dollar grant from Philip Morris. Originally they, originally we were approached by a member of the Board of Trustees at the Los Angeles County Museum where the show originated. It was actually the Los Angeles County Museum that, that had the initial idea for the show and our chairman, Joseph Cullman, was approached, and he immediately took a liking to the show, as did the rest of our senior management, because as I say it is a unique show. They were approached for a hundred thousand dollars, and as I say we were turned around and gave them one hundred twenty five thousand. And one of the things that we know about art is that unfortunately there's not a lot of financial support for art except among the very, very wealthy and corporations such as Philip Morris, by showing support for the Arts is helping to bring art to the people, and particularly when it comes to Black art, uh basically Black art comes out of the experiences of Black people collectively, and therefore it should be appreciated and presented in such a fashion that Black people the Black community at large can benefit from it as well as white community. So John, as a sculptor, I noticed that the exhibit includes not only paintings but some very fine sculpture, including some of your own work. What specifically do you think sculptors have been trying to say about the Black experience?

Johnâ€‰Rhoden 00:07:18.780
Speaking for, say I should say as a sculptor, what are the sculptors trying to say about the Black experience. Uh, it's sometimes very difficult, because I think as a sculptor like many sculptors that I've spoken with, or had some association, associations with, I think they tend to first start doing sculpture. They do not think first that I'm going to express something, not unless it's a commission of specific sort of idea that has to be, you have to satisfy someone. But I think the average sculptor, and I think also for myself, we are sculptors because first place we have to do sculpture, and we do not think of say, I will do something, if you, uh, when I think of "Soul of Reason," you are doing something basic within your own feeling of expression. Now, if that should happen to be of a Black experience, great, but to start out to say I'm going to express something of a Black experience it sometimes could be very difficult in its fleet.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:28.650
That's a beautiful point, because one of the things that has come up in evaluating this particular exhibit, as well as in evaluating other significant exhibits of Black art, is whether Black art is a sociological treatise or a sociological statement, or whether it's art. Romi, or Romare, Bearden, as a, as an artist, particularly one who has been right on the forefront of sociological breakthrough, breakthrough and things of that type, how do you feel about the criticisms, particularly by some of the well-known art critics in town, that this particular exhibition is more of a sociological statement than it is an artistic presentation.

Romare Bearden 00:09:20.520
Oh I can't see that at all, when you're saying that I was thinking of the exhibit. Let us take one of the very first Afro-American Artists, the painter Joshua Johnson, who lived in Baltimore. He was a portrait painter, and he painted the wealthy people of Baltimore, all of the so-called American Primitive style of painting, of Peale and some of the other men at that time. Then you have Tanner comes to mind, who is a painter of religious subject matter; Edmonia Lewis, who is a neo-classical painter; Duncanson who belonged with the Hudson River School of landscape; here's John Rhoden, who you just mentioned, that he works in often a very non-representational spatial forms, that he welds, ah I just can't. And if you, uh some of the artists, let us say Jake Lawrence, Jacob Lawrence, has dealt with certain historical aspects of the Afro-American experience and often in a narrative way. So, but I think that what he's done is so artistic that he uh, that you can't say that it is just a sociological aspect. So I can't see that as a criticism. Unless people mean by the mare, I mean by the mere, fact of dealing with a group of Black artists that it was done on the basis where here you're offering them a show such as this, and it is a sociological, for sociological reasons. But the art itself I think doesn't reflect that, and as I've mentioned in the case of Lawrence, it transcends that. I would think that the mere fact that Black artists, as you mentioned in your opening statement program have been ignored by the general public, and even by the critical public. Probably the thing that comes to mind most is that for a long period of time it was difficult for me as a youngster and for others to know that Henry O. Tanner was a Black artist, that Horace Pippen was a Black artist, and the whole principle of role models, the involvement of Black people in every aspect of society is negated when people don't have an opportunity to know that, yes, there are Black people who are painting and sculpting and doing other things in the art world. Let me ask Larry Wilson a question. When this came up, and you and some other people at Philip Morris had to make some judgments about this, did you see this in the context of helping to project some of the special experiences and aesthetic concerns of a particular group of people, namely Black Americans. And I imagine the two centuries really comes about because we're talking about the bicentennial which occurred in 1976, and the two centuries says that Black people, in a sense, have been an integral part of the Republic since its founding, and not only an integral political and economic part, but also an integral aesthetic part. Is that the type of thing that your company was trying to say in supporting this?

Larry Wilson 00:12:55.250
I think so. The, the criticism that I've read talks about the show is, it talks about the show as being [um], one that speaks more of a social kind of history. I don't know if there's anything all that wrong with that really. I think the art in the show is excellent art. I think that David took a lot of pains over two to three years to assemble this art from different parts of the country, and I think it was very successful at getting the best caliber of art, the best, the best artworks available together to open in Los Angeles, and then on to Dallas and Atlanta, and then finally in New York. Now, when the critics come out and say, "Well, it's really more of a social kind of commentary," maybe in some ways it is. But really Roscoe, what's what's so wrong about that. What's so wrong with that. We're at a time now when ethnic consciousness is very important in this country. The interesting thing is that that this show was assembled before this whole interest in "Roots" and all of that ever came about. What it speaks about Black people it speaks about the contribution they've made as far as slave artisans, as, as artists right after, artists right at the time of slavery, into the early nineteen hundreds during the Negro Renaissance and all of that. And as I say Philip Morris is very proud of each work that's represented in the show. And one criterion that we've always had as we've assembled as gotten involved in different kinds of shows is that the show, that the artworks had to be of good quality. I said, I should say, have an excellent caliber and we feel that that's what we've got in this show.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:47.540
I would assume that the show is a show of excellent art. I would assume that it's just as valid to present a show of Black American artists as it is to present a show of Picasso or Matisse or Cezanne, or any other artist, or any other group of artists. So I think that is really a totally irrelevant consideration. I think the more relevant criticism however, might be the question of limitation to artists who painted before 1950, I believe that it was the idea of that they would not include some of the younger more contemporary artists because they need a cut-off point. Is there any particular rationale behind that, John, that you can think of? I think there is one, and it had to be a cut-off date. I'll make a quick statement: when I started out to be an artist, I was interested in art, I was in Alabama. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and say at the time that I really became not so much wanting to be in art but actually doing art because it was sort of a compulsion I could not help it. There was no art schools. There was four major art schools I think in America at that time: the Art Students League, the Chicago Art Institute and a few others. But since 1950, if you think of the record, every university has an art department, every college has an art department, and everybody has -- you know, training in some form of art. Since the 50s I believe, you have done more painting by say, the artist -- whether they are Black, but mostly we think of Black now -- than the whole, say 100 or 250, I mean years before that time. And can you imagine the confusion and how the critics would really be behind the eight ball if they had to talk about, from say 200 up until the present time which would be to say 50 years at 225 years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:51.130
Of course there is some suggestion that there are some artists who've painted since 1950, when even in that brief period of time have developed significant reputations. I believe Sam Gilliam is one of the people who was mentioned

Johnâ€‰Rhoden 00:17:04.60.999999999883585
[cross-talk] Yes, I agree, yes...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:04.067
as having been excluded, and I know that at least initially some people in the Black art community, artistic community, were somewhat disturbed about this. On the other hand because of the fact that, as frequently happens with Black concerns, people start criticizing us because we are Black. Then we begin to develop sort of a defense around what we are doing. And I know that there was some controversy about how many of the pieces were going to be shown in the Brooklyn Museum, as a result of the collective action of various artists, all of the pieces are going to be shown. One comment I did read, Romare, was that some of the significant pieces even of yours, were not included in the exhibit. Is this because it's just difficult to get them, or is it because of an aesthetic judgment on the part of David Driscoll.

Romare Bearden 00:17:55.451
Oh well yes. Chris-- David made the selections of the work, but I did a similar show with Carl Greene in 1967, and I got letters. You know ,there was a famous cartoonist who was not in the show. And I along with two other artists, and the directors of a gallery that show the work of young artists 30 years and under, for the same reason that John mentioned, there's so many young minority artists who are coming on the scene especially in the last decade and--

[unclear] 00:18:32.441
And very good!

Romare Bearden 00:18:32.447
--And very good! And a man called me one day and he wanted to show in the gallery and I said fine but I ask him, "How old are you?" And he said, "I'm 53." And I said, "Well you know, our gallery policy is just to show artists 30 years and under." He said, "You mean you're discriminating against me because of my age!" And I felt so bad that I had a long explanation of why we did this. I don't think it satisfied him. I don't think some Richard Hunt and Gilliam, and and a number of the other artists might be satisfied with this explanation. But I think that a --another show of contemporary Black artists should be mounted. But I would do it in a different way than this. This show was done in a chronological manner, and if I did a show contemporary -- there are some of the artists who are political in nature, who make that the basis of their art, like Dana Chandler in Boston. There's some of the artists who want to move toward the mainstream of contemporary art and whose painting, sculpture, and graphics reflect that. I would have artists in that category. I would take the various trends that you see -- those like Vincent Smith, who use African motifs now in their art -- and get good representative artists in each of these categories, because you couldn't do a show, no one could do a show, for about 10,000 works -- this is what I would do it that way. And I think that kind of a show -- for contemporary -- something for Philip Morris to think about -- contemporary artists should be done. But I think you remember this show, it had to do with the bicentennial, and it is a show not sociological, but I think it's historical in nature.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:40.671
Name it, the subtitle may be, "We Were There."

Romare Bearden 00:20:43.281
That's true.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:20:43.283
Let's let the world know that Black Americans have been everywhere that we supposed to be. Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with John Rhoden, Romare Bearden and Larry Wilson about the "Two Centuries of Black American Art" exhibit which is now at the Brooklyn Museum on Eastern Parkway, and will be at the museum through the early part of September. But now as we have this particular show, and it raises the questions about what the quality of the art is, what's being said, what artists should be included. It does raise a question about the support for Black artists in general. Some people say it really doesn't make any difference, an artist as an artist as an artist. And the experience of a Black artist really isn't any different than the experience of white artists. I know literally hundreds of artists, and for the audience, I might mention that we will be having some of the people from some of these newer galleries on the show sometime during the summer to talk about what's happening in the New York City art community. But what about this question, John, about -- I'll ask Romare can speak about it too -- what about the so-called similarity or differences of experience between the white artists and the Black artists.

Johnâ€‰Rhoden 00:22:02.720
I'll try and make this quick, as fast as possible, because when you say difference of experiences when I became interested in art really, one of the primary things in my life I wanted to do was to have experiences. So I traveled around the world twelve years, I met all kinds of people, museums, museums, university students, and the experiences I think would be the same as anyone else. And so you express your -- as I said before, and unless it was commissioned -- you express yourself basic the way you feel based on your experiences. If we breathe, if I breathe the same polluted air as any other artist being white, green, or blue or, I eat the same sort of plastic foods or have some experiences. Suppose we had the same experiences, now. No, you're not aware of the color, put them aside, and say create something based on this. It would be totally different because the experience is similar but different. You understand --

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:07.740
Well collectively, collectively I understand point, but collectively would you say that the collective social experience of Black artists is different than the collective social experience of white artists, and thereby might influence the art differently?

Johnâ€‰Rhoden 00:23:26.070
That could be answered I think in a way when you think of soul food, soul music -- we fans tend to think that it has to be different. The critic has to find a reason why it is different. I basically think the creative impulse of spirit of anyone that's really serious about that work. I don't think, I can't see how you can separate it as being different. This is my place.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:52.450
Okay let me, I wanna hear Romare, and then I'll get Larry. Romare, what do you think about that?

Romare Bearden 00:23:56.250
Well I think that what John says, that Black artists has different experiences and, but they can translate these differences of experience, certainly a child growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant or Harlem has a different experience than one going to Ethical Culture or living in Scarsdale. But it does not say that that the child in Scarsdale or the child in Harlem can't make a significant contributions to a culture. Now, if -- let us say that both of them came one coming from Harlem and one coming from another, a white community and they became abstract painters; maybe the Black artist who was moving into that would express himself just a bit differently.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:24:59.550
Larry, what do you think about that?

Larry Wilson 00:25:01.470
Roscoe, who was it that once said that, art speaks to everybody, no matter what what their background is, no matter what their race is, no matter what their social socioeconomic level might be. It speaks to everyone, that there is no more, there is no more common or, or lasting a strong lasting a bond between people than their art. Now they're not saying Black art. They're not saying white art. They're not saying French art. They're saying art in general. If there is a difference between the work of Black artists as opposed to another, another group of artists. It might be, it might stem from the fact that Blacks have been isolated from the mainstream of society for so many years. But I think I'd like, I'd like to think that we're going to get it at some point where art will be considered for art's sake and it won't be Black art, it won't be white art, it won't be any other kind of art that's that's attributed to a certain race or, or group of people. Because I think art really is the expression of a certain creative sense that we all have, and it's manifested in different ways.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:26:19.090
But on the other hand, one of the things that anyone who writes, paints, involved music in, is that the feelings that you have are responsive to the social environment you live in. Art doesn't exist in a vacuum, whether it's visual art, or sculpture, or music, or literature -- the life you live does affect this. And one of the classical problems -- and this problem has been talked about over and over again -- among Black creative people, is whether they identify with what their roots have done to them, or whether they really totally subsume themselves in the larger artistic community. It's the question really, that will never be resolved because it is a continuing interaction between the larger community and the special group of people that we happen to be as Black people. Let me ask this though, with more emphasis on the Black artist -- is there an increase in recognition and financial reward for Black artists in general? Romare and then John.

Romare Bearden 00:27:23.340
Yes, I think that while much more needs to be done, I went on Sunday to a show that a man and his wife gave in their house -- Al Hollingsworth. And Al sold about twenty eight works this Sunday. They were mostly Black people there. But when we say Black art, I think one of the, the first, the greatest artistic expression of this time has been abstract expressionism. And if you look at those painters, they were very much influenced by jazz music. The dissonances, the action, the complete involvement with the work itself, and knowing many of these artists they all play jazz while they paint it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:15.261
What about you John, quickly.

Johnâ€‰Rhoden 00:28:16.861
Well I think, quickly, it should be, much more should be done. I really feel that more can be done. The only thing about a show like this is attention has been brought forward. And then say a month later, after the show is over, perhaps it's forgotten, it should never be forgotten, but continually and continually to support the arts.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:35.370
And Larry Wilson, is Phillip Morris going to continue to support Black art?

Larry Wilson 00:28:38.810
Philip Morris will continue to to support art, Roscoe. We feel that art's very important it has made a significant contribution to our company.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:28:47.640
