Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:23.730
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thoughts. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:00:50.580
Shakespeare's classic play, "Macbeth," will be presented soon by the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Company. Tonight on "Soul of Reason," Barbara Montgomery, who plays Lady Macbeth in the production, will be talking with us about her exciting role in this production. Barbara, all of us or many of us in the audience know you from your many roles with the Negro Ensemble Company, generally black oriented. Well let's not say generally--definitely black oriented. And here we see that Barbara Montgomery is going to play Lady Macbeth in La MaMa company's presentation of "Macbeth," and what I'm sure the audience would like to know is: what is your reaction to playing in this classic Shakespearean production?

Barbara Montgomery 00:01:42.601
I find it extremely exhilarating. It makes me feel good to work on it because I get a chance to feel, make aware the audience, of how I feel in playing this particular queen or this particular woman, this ogre-ess...this awful broad. You know, she's many things and we're all aware of what goes on around us. And we meet people like her. I'm not like that. [laughter] Not at all. She's strong and she's powerful she--she loves, she's human. She wants her husband to reach the heights of his particular...well of his...how do I say it? To be--

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:41.882
To be the top of what he is supposed to be.

Barbara Montgomery 00:02:43.534
What he is supposed to be, exactly.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:02:44.910
That sounds so much like America in 1977, and our society...which, of course, really deals with the fact that the play is timeless and deals with why Shakespeare, despite some of our disparaging remarks about him being a classical white writer, in a sense has stood the test of time. By the way, have any your friends mentioned the question or asked the question about the relevancy of a black actress--a well-known black actress--playing in a classical Shakespearean production?

Barbara Montgomery 00:03:25.050
No, not yet. [Laughs]

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:32.570
What is that, they haven't seen it? Or haven't thought about it?

Barbara Montgomery 00:03:34.130
No, no one has said anything. One way or the other. I'm doing it. "Oh Montgomery, you're doing Lady Macbeth." "Yes I am." "I'd like to see that." That's as far as the comment has gone.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:49.790
Well I think that represents somewhat of a change from, let's say, the late '60s. I think that, and of course, you're as aware as I am of the fact that even going back into the '30s at the Harlem "Y," there were a large number of companies that produced--not a large number, but at least two--that produced Shakespearean productions, going back into...even back to 1821 with the African Grove Theater in Greenwich Village. There were black productions of Shakespeare being presented. The allegation on the part of some of the activists in the late '60s was that by black actors and actresses concentrating on Shakespeare and Noel Coward and any of the other plays written by white playwrights, they were negating or voiding the black experience. Hence, we should do more plays that dealt with our culture, and in the sense many of the black theater companies were developed around that particular focus. Now I think some eight years later, nine years later, where there have been so many fine black plays, my guess is that the black theater-going audience and the blacks who are involved in the theater are much less sensitive about involvement and what might be called classical theater. What is your feeling about my generalization?

Barbara Montgomery 00:05:19.430
Well I think that we can do any kind of theater. We can do anything we so choose to do and as an actress, I am--will do anything that I believe to do for me, for my people, in any language.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:05:39.362
Of course, you are in a sense projecting something that Ellen Stewart projected a few weeks ago--and some of the other black performers, actors, and actresses who've been on the show have projected--namely that being in the dramatic world is in fact your life and you have a right to live your life in many different ways and in many different forms. And one of the roles of the actor is to be able to portray a variety of circumstances in a variety of ways and in that sense--as you say, any language--any medium does it. On the other hand, I think it can be said that the growth of black theater is almost in direct proportion to the extent to which black theater has dealt with black concerns, and that does raise the question of how much we need to get at this point, we can afford to not deal with black concerns. As true as you suggest, maybe "Macbeth" is a universal theme and it could be applied to black. I know that when "The Wiz" came up some people said, "Why would we want to do 'The Wiz' with a black cast?" When "Guys and Dolls" came up, "Why would we want to do 'Guys and Dolls' with a black cast?" And it so happened that both those [were] very, very successful. They were very enjoyable and they were performed exceedingly well. What about that? What about that balance of where the black theatrical personality is going to place his or her emphasis at this time?

Barbara Montgomery 00:07:28.110
I don't know how to answer that. I think there are some things that that can be touched and re-colored and gone over with a different colored brush, and then against some things...no. And why make the...why do it? Why attempt? Robert Patrick, when...when I was reading for "Kennedy's Children," Robert who is a friend, the writer/playwright of "Kennedy's Children." He wanted me to read for Carla and Wanda. Wanda was a role that I...that I most liked. Carla was the role that Shirley Knight did. She did a fine job. I didn't agree with wanting to read for that particular character. I told--I said Robert, "I don't want to read for Carla." Robert had seen me at the Old Reliable doing many sexy ladies and I'd been performing in slips at the Old Reliable when we were part of the original off-off-Broadway, you know. And so I could do this and talk about Marilyn Monroe and how I thought blah blah. But I told him I said I don't feel that any black woman ever thought this particular way within--within what he was...what he had written. Why wouldn't...he still to this day doesn't understand. Now Wanda was...could very easily have been portrayed by an Oriental American woman, you know? So my being black had had no effect to me on that particular character, but a black actress would have if she had done Carla. It would not have been good for the play.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:58.550
Mm-hmm.

Barbara Montgomery 00:08:59.881
So some things we can do and I think we should always investigate and try things and deal with what's written...and then, and find there's something we can't do.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:10.680
All right, well, take that one step further. What about an all-black cast for a Shakespearean production--"Hamlet," "Macbeth," "Caesar," "Cleopatra," what have you. Well what about that too?

Barbara Montgomery 00:09:30.601
Why not?

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:09:32.641
All right, I'll say: why?

Barbara Montgomery 00:09:35.040
Well if uh--if we have something comparable for these to enable these actors to extend themselves that's written by a black writer then we'll do that. I mean we are kings, we are queens, and we have that depth and we do know more than four-letter words. And we're more than prostitutes and pimps and all of that. And we're more than people with lots of hang-ups, you know and so...and until the time comes we'll just have to deal with it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:11.101
Because that's an...that presents an interesting paradox because on one hand part of the allegation that theater in general, classical theater in particular--O'Neill, Anderson, what have you--were that it was irrelevant to blacks. Was the fact that it dealt with middle class figures and it did not deal with the guts of black life. So that for a short period of time, black life consisted of, you say, four letter words, violence, prostitutes, and people with a lot of crazy hang-ups. And it was extolled as telling it like it is and really dealing with black life. Any one of us who's black and obviously we are, knows just from how life is experienced that really isn't even the majority of black life.

Barbara Montgomery 00:10:57.230
Not at all.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:10:57.233
It is a very small subset which some people--mainly white sociologists and some white playwrights--have tended to project as the reality of black life. Yet, in a sense, we sort of fell into that trap by having so much of our early intensive black theater developed around it. Now I know Doug Ward through NEC has really tried overtly to avoid that by bringing in plays like "River Niger," plays like "Brownsville Raid," "First Breeze of Summer," which dealt with the more universal aspects of black life and I would say Ed Bullins in his own writing as it developed began to move away from that as did Baraka. But it's interesting that we fell in to the same trap that we accuse the sociologists and the so-called liberal [inaudible] of doing to us. And what you're really saying now is that by playing roles in the classical plays--in addition to plays related to our own culture--that we are clearly making a statement that we are really like everyone else in the overall artistic and general community.

Barbara Montgomery 00:12:14.810
It seems that's what I'm saying. Yeah it is.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:12:19.130
All right now let's take it one step further, into--one more step--into "Macbeth" itself. You play in a sense really, the key role in the play. One of the two key roles. So certainly in many ways people will say the Lady is the key. What are you trying to do in terms of your interpretation of the role? Now, this role's been played literally hundreds of thousands of times [laugh] ...so now Barbara Montgomery, a black actress who has a number of credits, really down so, is now playing Lady Macbeth. Now what are you going to do for Lady Macbeth that someone else hasn't done?

Barbara Montgomery 00:13:04.750
Well what I--I'm going to give her Barbara. That's something that nobody else has ever done. And...she's a woman, and as I said before she has a lust for power. She's pushy. She also loves in her own way. She is a human being. I'm trying to deal with the human quality of the woman with all these other aspects.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:13:37.850
Well in your opinion, what is the key scene in the play? What...is there any particular scene that you can pick out that really sort of epitomizes the role of Lady Macbeth in this whole drama or epitomizes her particular personality?

Barbara Montgomery 00:13:59.180
Yeah, I think it might be when her husband has decided he's had second thoughts about doing this deed: killing the King, which they got together and decided they were going to do. And she uses her quick mind, her feminine wiles to put him back into where they were originally. You know, let's go on with this plan.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:14:33.140
All right can you--is it possible for you to just give us a few lines of how you get into that at this point? [Montgomery vocalizes in a spooky way] Yeah. Okay. All right. Want to try?

Barbara Montgomery 00:14:43.651
You want something to fall down around here?

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:14:47.341
I think you are Lady Macbeth! I think you really got us now! I think you really got us. But as you get into that now, you know, you're really getting into this play now. As you get into that, what techniques are you using in terms of really getting into it? Are you, uh, projecting yourself into that particular part of history, or are you just taking the words and projecting them as you really would feel about them today? Are you using any particular technique to get into that role?

Barbara Montgomery 00:15:25.200
No. Nothing other than...as I always work with my own emotion, following my instincts. We work with that and then we'll trim it. The director has done that, but she hasn't had--he hasn't had to do so much. I mean it's...with any role, that's the way I do it. I make it live for me. First I deal with the emotion and then the words come.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:51.180
Mm-hmm. And you're saying, in a sense, the emotions are timeless.

Barbara Montgomery 00:15:56.801
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:57.031
In this particular play.

Barbara Montgomery 00:15:58.571
In any.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:58.912
So therefore--in any play?

Barbara Montgomery 00:16:00.751
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:02.491
That's an interesting point. That's an interesting point. Now when you say emotions you're really talking about basic emotions like--

Barbara Montgomery 00:16:10.621
Human.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:11.072
Hate, fear, sorrow--

Barbara Montgomery 00:16:13.141
All of it, all of it. And any of it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:15.922
But doesn't that--

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:17.601
Thirst.

Barbara Montgomery 00:16:17.601
Thirst for power?

Barbara Montgomery 00:16:18.781
Thirst for water. You know, just any of our emotions or feelings that we have as human beings cause you're dealing with a character. You have to give it...you have to give it everything that you have.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:16:32.020
You have to give the character dimension and depth. On the other hand, isn't the context within which that emotion takes place, doesn't that have something to do with the way in which a particular role might be played? I think you get a good example when you talk about "Kennedy's Children" and the role of Carla. That one, one...even just the physiognomy, just the face of the person who does it, does something to the role. And then when you add to it the style of that particular person, you know, some people are more effusive in their mannerisms and their facial gestures. Some people a little bit tighter, some a little bit more regal, and so on. So in that sense, the context within which the role takes place, at least, could conceivably affect the way in which it projects the emotion.

Barbara Montgomery 00:17:21.481
That hasn't entered, or presented itself a problem anywhere. There's one line she has about her hands are of his color but she shames to wear a heart so white. I--that's just...I'm not going to change that, don't want to change it. I make it work for whatever--however I want to. I am obviously not white and my hands are not white and his hands are not really white. Well I guess they're pink, you know, they're not white either. I mean I have not let it affect my head in any way my...you know, I don't want to say the lines. [Laughter] I was tempted just then.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:07.852
Just tempted, okay.

Barbara Montgomery 00:18:10.150
But that's the only point. I mean other than that, there's nothing that I, you know...I mean to be a queen or to be a woman of prominence or whatever, that said well look at me. I mean look at you, look at Clarence.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:26.861
You all.

Barbara Montgomery 00:18:27.272
I mean you just do that.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:29.981
Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with a queen, Barbara Montgomery, who is playing Lady Macbeth in the La MaMa Experimental Company's production of "Macbeth". And speaking of the production, I gather from what you said is that the cast and the director of this production are white.

Barbara Montgomery 00:18:50.140
Yes. Well we have Augusto, that's an Oriental actor who plays the doctor, and our director is from Lithuania. He's a Lithuanian exile. He was asked to leave his country, and he's been in the United States about living a year. We also have an Arab in the company.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:19:11.501
Yeah I know that, uh, Ellen Stewart who more or less is the creative genius behind La MaMa prides herself on clustering creative people from all backgrounds together, under her wing, from all over the world.

Barbara Montgomery 00:19:26.772
All over the world.

00:19:27.761
And when she was on the show she spoke, with pride, about the upcoming production of "Macbeth" and that Barbara Montgomery was going to come and join her and work with her on that. Have you done other things with Ellen?

Barbara Montgomery 00:19:42.610
Yes sure. I was there for...'69...I was sort of there for two years, or two and a half years, as a company member of Andrei Serban's company. Andrei did "The Cherry Orchard" recently for Joe Papp, and the "Agamemnon" production. And since that time, it was like almost being in residence at La MaMa. I have been back several times to do things, as I'm doing now, and then of course the "Caligula" that I'm going to do with Tom O'Horgan after this--I couldn't, being a commercial person, I couldn't you know, remain at La MaMa for long lengths of time because of, you know, financially I'm not able to subsist off of that money. But it's not about money. And if you can...if I had, if I had more commercials or something where I was getting moneys, then I wouldn't mind spending more time at La MaMa because I can do the things I like to do there. And the feeling of La MaMa is so open to all your creative energies. I mean it just it gives and absorbs you and it gives you back other things, you know. And it happens that--that I want to continue to be there because of that.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:20:58.090
Of course you've more or less hit on the classic dilemma of most people in the arts; whether it be drama, music, the visual arts. That is the conflict between making a living, surviving, and projecting your artistic interests, energies, and the like. What do you think can be done to resolve this in this country? Some countries have state theaters and other kinds of things. We have what might be called the 'hustle theater.' You hustle for money here, and you hustle for money there, and if you're lucky you keep on going. Yet, there are literally tens of thousands of Barbara Montgomery-like people who give their energies and cut corners and get into creative things like "Macbeth" and some of the things that the black theater has done. Do you see any any change in the wind? Do you think there should be a change or do you think that part of this--I've heard people say, part of the struggle is what makes us great. I don't really necessarily believe that. But as one, we are taking...making an asset out of a liability. But what do you think about that?

Barbara Montgomery 00:22:10.911
Would be nice if, [inaudible, likely a name] or somebody'd come up with some money for us. I don't think it'll ever happen in this country that...I don't think there's that much, I shouldn't say respect, I don't mean that. The arts are not looked upon as being anything particularly special here. I mean it's just a...a way of our lives. They want to sing, or dance, or act, or be a doctor or whatever, I mean that's the next...fits right along in there. And so, I don't think they're ever going to give us any kind of moneys other than unemployment afterwards. We worked so many weeks like any, any other person has put in so many weeks. And then you can collect the unemployment insurance.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:23:03.690
Of course, you made an interesting comment. You say the arts are like any other part of contributing aspects of life, doctors, engineers, etc. Are you suggesting that the artist should have a role that is almost like that of a priest in the old cultures? Namely above and beyond just the average person. Or are you suggesting that the arts should be funded in a way so that this particular aspect of society can develop possibly as much as other aspects of society?

Barbara Montgomery 00:23:42.750
Yes, that it should be funded. I think there are many people who are clerks, and typists, and what have you, that are potential actors or painters or whatever and they don't know...they may not know that. In the knowing, in that you have decided...whether it was decided for you, or if you hit upon it when you were 15 or 35, and are willing to accept what comes along with it--which is very little--I do believe that we should be given some sort of moneys just for that. Just for the knowing.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:23.222
Of course, the same guy who wrote "Macbeth" said "All of the world's a stage" and so on, "and all the people in it--"

Barbara Montgomery 00:24:32.312
Merely players.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:33.511
So the suggestion that I've heard is that everyone has some form of art and not necessarily the theater. But it may be the visual arts, maybe the creative arts, one form or another. And in a sense, part of our Puritan background, our Protestant ethic says that you have to work hard, you have to do something that's unpleasant to get a living. Whereas working in the arts is really pleasant, because it's giving you a chance to explore your feelings and giving you a chance to be seen. I'm not suggesting that I believe this, not by a long shot. What I'm saying is that this is the climate within which the arts exists in our society. Yet you find that many of the people who are most esteemed outside of the halls of power, of finance, and politics are in fact people who are in the arts. They may be music people, it may be film people, and maybe theater people. So there is sort of an inconsistency in there. On one hand, the society says, 'Look you're lucky to be able to do this, and we can make it hard for you to do it.' On the other hand, the society says 'Once you've done it, you are really in, and you're really on top.' To me, I'm not an artist in that sense--although I guess everybody is in one sense. To me, that would be very frustrating if I were, in fact, a professional artist. It would give me mixed messages. Do you in fact get mixed messages in our society about what the role of the artist is and how society feels about the artist?

Barbara Montgomery 00:26:12.690
Oh yes. Oh yes. And I think if society ever really knew what goes on, that we wouldn't have any audience. Because they would say, "I'm not gonna go down and see those fools," you know? If they ever really knew...the pleasure comes out of loving it. Other than that it's just as...you have many, many aches in your back. You have many, as many knots on your shins. You have the same amount of toothaches or whatever. I mean there's nothing...and it's so disheartening when it's not right for you. It's so frustrating. It doesn't begin in the theater and end there with lots of smiles and all that. In the rehearsal period especially it's extremely grueling, but it's like you want to do it. You love doing it, but you take this home with you. Your family's oft-times affected by your particular emotional state and dealing with...not so much a role even, just dealing with your job, your work...and you bring it home! Many people bring work home at night from their offices. We bring it home from our theaters, from our rehearsal and it has to be thought out and it's and it's...it's more than intellectually, it has to come sometimes--for me, especially--from inside. You know, you can't say, "Well let me look at this book and see how I'm going to get out of this problem that I'm having with my character." Or on the job, there's on the job problems also, as in any working situation. It's still very similar similar to every other walk of life. I mean it's frustrations, and it's not easy, and it's not all hunky dory.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:52.911
All right as we come to the close of tonight's show, what advice would you give to young people who are interested in entering the theater?

Barbara Montgomery 00:28:02.633
Take a look at yourselves and if that's what you so have decided, do that. Always respecting yourself and the craft itself, and work toward craftsmanship and don't deal with wanting to be a star or wanting lots of money. That may happen for a few...but very few if you go into it thinking that way.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:28:25.910
And that's really a very insightful point on which to end because it does reflect the sensitivity that you, Barbara Montgomery, have as a professional actress. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Barbara Montgomery, who is playing Lady Macbeth in the La MaMa Experimental Theater Company's production of "Macbeth." And Barbara, it's been wonderful having you with us tonight.

Barbara Montgomery 00:28:50.871
Thank you, Dr. Brown. Been my pleasure.
