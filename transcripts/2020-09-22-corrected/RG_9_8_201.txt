Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:22.420
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:00:48.761
One of the most innovative community programs in Harlem and the city at large is the Freedom Fund United Foundation's Freedom Cultural Train, which has serviced over 3,000 New York youth. Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we'll be talking with Lavenia Byer, coordinator, Jeanette Fields, chairperson, and Andrew Henderson, consultant for Freedom Funds United Foundation. And we're glad to have all of you with us this evening.

Andrew Henderson 00:01:15.491
Very glad to be here.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:01:17.711
Well, now let's talk about the purpose of the Freedom Fund's United Freedom Cultural Train--and Andy, since you've been on the show before and you usually speak up loud and clear, we'll let you start on that one.

Andrew Henderson 00:01:31.630
Well as you know many times that we have met in the past, both on-air and off-air, we've talked about some very basic things that most people never seem to realize or become concerned with. The most important thing about black people has to be the image that is created to represent black people. We have tried for years to own media, but we have not been able to do that--either in newspaper, either in television, either in radio whatever it may be--which means continuously to reach the masses about the classes we're never involved. Which means, continuously, the good that black people continues to do to overcome is generally overshadowed by the negative that is shown. So we felt that in order to deal with this at a non-minimal basis would be to get involved in the mechanism that would allow black people to exchange ideas to exchange thought and to share energies. So we came up with the Freedom Fund's Cultural Train. The purpose of the Freedom Fund's Cultural Train is that we hopin' that all black people will get on board. Because we recognize the fact there's a great mis-concept being construed since our history in this country that all black people are the same...and they're not. And the Freedom Fund Cultural Train is about giving each black person the chance to see his brother in another setting, to let them see that purpose of choice which we call 'freedom' leads us to, many times, do different things and all of these are meaningful in the struggle. It's not only good to have a warrior, you must have a thinker, you must have a general, you must have soldiers, you must have a lot of other things. And this is what the Freedom Cultural Train does: it gets everybody on board so we each can share and respect each other. Because I like to bring back one word before you move on: and that's the word 'intercourse.' If you got your interchange into interaction, you got to have intercourse. And long as we allow intercourse to be what they say it means, then we're not going to have no relationship.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:03:24.190
All right...Lavenia, you're a coordinator. Could you tell us a little about exactly how the Cultural Train operates? What do you do? Where do you do it? How do you get it started, and so on?

Lavenia Byer 00:03:35.410
Well, I can only speak about the the segment I'm involved in at this moment. Yesterday, just yesterday...we...Mr. Henderson let us go into the new place that he has on 149th and Ed--uh, 192 Edgecombe Avenue. And the kids...we were cleaning it up and fixing it up, getting it ready for the summer program. And they're going to have skating board exercise...you know, tournaments, and chess tournaments for the elders. We have something for the children as well as the elders. They have the pop-see tournaments and the low-dee tournaments [These games need clarification - ed.] and they're going to have recipe tournaments for the elders...so it's going to involve all of the ages: men women and children of the neighborhood.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:04:25.330
Now of course this ties in with what Andy was saying about reaching the black community through a variety of activities. One of the things that's becoming very popular now are what they call 'city games' or 'street games': the various type of games that we've been playing in the black community--and other ethnic groups have been playing--in the cities for literally years and becoming much more popular. And I gather that you're building on that by having a whole range of games that some of the young people could participate in.

Lavenia Byer 00:04:54.511
Yes--

Andrew Henderson 00:04:54.513
I'd like to interject if you don't mind, and that's a very important point that you just brought up. We're trying to reclaim from television--like I said, we've got to keep bringing to the forefront that image consciousness. See, we came up with a lot of games that many black people have a say in their community, have made them appreciated in their community, because of their specific skill in these specific games. And we got to know each other on a competitive level but still a social level. And now what has happened every time we come up with any type things in our community, then the media claims these things to exploit them, so now people are not playing these games in the street no more for fun communications. They're now trying to go onto the media and other thing to challenge on those airs. And what we are trying to do is let the little person have something of his arts or his craft or skill to recognize himself by, to become familiar and acquainted with the community in. And I'd like to add one more point, and that is the fact that this does not just relate to children. We're dealing with senior citizens and youth, and we've called it long ago even with our other programs: generations together. Because the skill of senior citizens is the answer for the youth. Because of the fact they can only make X amount of dollars, yet and still they have a great amount of expertise and acumen that can be passed on. If we retired these people because the system said they should be retired, then nothing meaningful in their life exposes as well as nothing...the youth have a relationship and--to make a point that's very clear, and I've got to take this time to make it--and that is the simple fact everybody considers senior citizens a great problem. I don't care who it is. If it's the family--because as you start getting senile and as you start losing certain abilities and agilities, and the media shows...see, kids assault senior citizens, not for the reason that any of these black people are willing to talk about. When you have on television certain pictures of the wise and old person, or the horror movie or the...any of these type of movies, you see an old, baggy hag-y rag-y person, so naturally you build up an affinity toward this and we've got to make the people understand that ghost houses are not haunted houses, and haunted houses are not ghost houses, if you can understand what I mean. These can be houses that are inhabited by human beings, regardless of the situation or condition of that house. That human being is still a human being, and we trying to make our youth have the type of relationship with these senior citizens contrary to what they're being told and taught through the system.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:07:14.162
Of course, by saying what you've just said you've sort of spelled out the philosophy of your organization which is to help to rebuild our inner cities by concern for all of our peoples. And I think the point you've made about the respect for senior citizens is very, very important, because regardless of the economic level of our community I don't think that our country at large respects senior citizens as they should. We just haven't developed a philosophy for dealing with--not dealing with, but for allowing our senior citizens to have the type of life and experience that they should have as a result of them--

Andrew Henderson 00:07:48.450
The country can't do it, brother, that's what I'm saying now. Because...if you're talking about attrition--you understand that word, attrition? If you understand attrition, if you understand 65 years-old is 'immediate retirement,' if you understand that unless you clear these people out of the way then the young people don't have no place to go, so they say...then right away you're talking about destroying the seed of the heritage that went before you, and that's what startin' to happen in the city. And they're talking a lot of nonsense about really being involved with senior citizens. How many senior citizens programs are run by senior citizens? How many things involving senior citizens are controlled and run by senior citizens? Now it's not the same as with kids--although the same people manipulate the kids moneys--senior citizens do have the ability, they do have the acumen, they do have expertise and they do have the age. So it's not the same reason, yet it's still the same, results are the same. So we must bring these two people together to start speaking as a unit and as a body so that we can stop the parasitic plights that big business, city government, and other working force people portray on these type of people. This is our concern.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:08:56.950
All right, now let's talk with Jeanette Fields, who's the chairwoman of the Cultural Train. Jeanette, could you tell us exactly what your responsibilities as the chairwoman entail, and maybe a little something about how you get your funding for your activities?

Jeanette Fields 00:09:10.780
Well first, my primary part in the organization...I work more directly with Mr. Henderson and Sister Zakia, the project director, in locating places of cultural enlightenment to take to community people. As we say, to have these people to get together, you have to first find a way that you can have them together where they don't feel like you're trying to box them up and say, "We're going to put you together." So in culture, it is normal that whether you're a senior citizen or a youth, a cultural enlightenment is something that is like educational knowledge. And the only one that can't see this and appreciate it is someone that just doesn't understand that. So therefore when we take children--we don't just take the senior citizen to a play somewhere, or to a museum...and we take the senior citizen and the youth. We try to have it so that when we set up our outing or what have you for them, that there will be youths taking care of the senior citizens that cannot take care of their self. On the other hand, there would be senior citizens involved in governing the children that cannot govern their self. So this way, they have to work together, intermedia...and they get to, you know...like, our children would adopt one of the older people as having a grandparent or a godmother. And in doing this, we trying to see that the children would become escorts to senior citizens. As you know, we have so much problem with our senior citizens being able to go anywhere; the people are definitely frightened to come out they house...in fact they board their selves up. This here is really what we are trying to, you know, bring about a change with. And Freedom Fund United...we have our "Mother of the Year," and she works very closely with the children. I work more closely with Sister Zakia [This name needs clarification]. Anything that's done with theatre arrangements, or making the programs and the dates and so forth, the transportation and which groups will go at certain times in any thing that we are affiliated in, then I'm involved in that. More so, I get more paperwork than anything else, which I like because then and you know I'm able to read about it and really be involved with it. And through doing this, as Mr Henderson, said just in the last say--I'd say five or six months--we've taken over 3,000 people.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:11:44.280
I noticed that you have a number of really exciting things...you've been to see the Rock Bay Dancers, Bubbling Brown Sugar, the Joan Miller Chamber Arts Dance Company, The Wiz, the African Functional Theatre ,the George Harrington Rhythmic Dance Company, the African-American Ballet...and so on, and so on, and so on. So you have a really comprehensive program.

Andrew Henderson 00:12:06.210
Yeah, all of those places we were not able to go. And the reason is...you asked a question before, and it's a most poignant question. Most of times we get on air, I never get a chance to talk about it cause I'll be involved in other things. In the four and a half years that we have been in existence...we are non-profit tax exempt, first of all. We have never been funded by anybody, and unfortunately the reason why we pick this specific area--you asked about the Cultural Train--was because we found that this was the most difficult area. Because when you start talking about culture, when you start talking about cultural education, when you start talking about certain type things you find the city--as well as the forefathers of this country--really didn't have any real significance or meaning to see that we participated in this. You could build all the great centers you want downtown, midtown, and around town. But when you go in black communities, they're deprived of any of these type of relevancies. And unfortunately since we have to write proposals, we have to write budgets, we have to write other things then there's always somebody that has to approve these things and they're never going to approve certain parts of black budgets. And you know, me and you've talked about this very extensively: we have no money for consultants even when you're funded, you have no money for promotions and advertising even when you're funded, you have no money for real significant mailings or printing even when you're funded. All right. So now people say, "All right this program ain't doing nothing, this program rips off money, this program..." But see all this is set up, and that's why we understood this from running several programs, you know before, that we trying to show that...it is hardship, but it has to be taken on by black people. We have to start setting up philanthropies. We have to start setting up foundations such as we are, we have to start setting up scholarship funds, we have to start setting up certain type things where we can endow our owns because the system in no way is going to deal with this whatsoever because we have a great amount of people that have a great amount of Masters, BA's and all of the type of degrees...and they're still on unemployment line. And they're overqualified for the type of jobs that exist now for black people, yet and still they have followed the mandates that the system laid out. So what we're saying is that we have never been funded--we need all the financial help that we can get. Most red tape we cannot follow because of the fact that it will not allow us to do the type of things that we're talking about doing. Because we talking about developing communities within communities; if you talk about an affluent community, this don't come about like most people believe. This comes about by meaningful programs and entities existing in that community that people can support and the money will stay. You know, we talked about this once before: most of the services that belong to communities as well as most of the money that belong to communities are manipulated for neocolonialism from afar. Because if you're talking about indigenous poor, that has been all of the time. Every dollar moved in the government is moved on indigenous poor. Why then, would we have the problems we have to have? We don't need education to get moneys because when they talk about unemployment they're talking about us. They talk about welfare, they're talking about us. They're talking about school scholarships they talking about us...so we are qualified for all of the government money, yet and still we receive none. And the more we get educated, the more we're removed into a cycle that takes us away from what the realities are. Because every law that I've ever read dealing with education says, "Two years of employment equals four years of schooling, plus one year of employment." So you talking about five years as opposed to two years--on the job training seater programs prove what we're talking about, but these are work programs not allowed to exist meaningfully in black communities because we could take the work programs as they are, with the same money goin' to the same people and build up any rundown community in the city of New York. We've been talking about neighborhood restoration for the last ten years, but now these things are not [muffled dialogue] the same as culture. We can take now: cultural people and teach them through the culture because if you're talking about role playing, you're talking about play-acting. If you talk about controlling productions, if you talk about directing productions, then this is what we trying to do. We trying to direct the energies into the areas that will have some meanings that other people don't have to subsidize, but we can subsidize ourselves through this exchange.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:15:40.801
Now what kind of funding support would you want from the community? You want people to donate their time, to donate some money, to help you to get contact with people have money? What type of support do you want?

Andrew Henderson 00:15:51.450
We need all support. We have to first talk about financial support, because one thing that we have found out in the community in the last 15 years...we have one of the most supportive communities in the world. But since we don't have in-kind matching funds, since we don't have banks to support these things, since we don't have...after we do the work, they take the credit and keep the money. So we are saying there has to be a mechanism either through payroll saving plans--which people can do since we're non-profit tax exempt--that we've been talking about for a while, they can go up to their boss and other people and say, "I would like to donate so much money each week to Freedom Funds United," and this is what we could do. Now, we don't need to go through none of the other things. We also can have other fundraising activities that the people themselves must take upon themselves to inaugurate and initiate. Naturally, they must come and check us out first, we'd appreciate that. But we're talking about direct funding. And that's something that most people never talk about--we're talking about direct. Now understand I'm saying to you, my brother, cause it don't exist for us, direct funding. Not like yesterday where I went to see this Council of the Aging, and after we had worked out a beautiful agreement, then they told me that after the people performed the acts and did the services there would be no way to guarantee them their money right on the spot, or anything else. Ey--this is New York! Because we have no credibility. We don't have a telephone right now. Why? Because the telephone company, after we paid up all the money that we owed just about, asked us for a $375 deposit knowing that there was no way possible we could pay that money. Why? Because we are talking about dealing in civil rights and in human rights. Now when you start talking about this, you're talking about dealing with the government...and the government has lost its credibility. This is what the whole thing that we talking about what is happening in the city of New York. It means that if you want a telephone, the city has to pay for it even if it's a funded program. Then you have no more credibility. Your landlord no longer will let you owe him any money. You have vendors, or your merchants, now will not let you do business unless you're giving cash upfront...see, so when they have stripped, when Big Mac and them, the financial control board, they have now disenfranchised black people in the city of New York to the point where we can't even talk about any funding. Even after you get the commitment and guarantee, it takes a year or some time to collect your money. Little people, black people, that's why they haven't been able to bid on contracts, don't have this type of upfront money to be able to lay back. Our merchants need to know, our vendors need to know, our people need to know that if certain things are done...because right now if a person went and volunteered their time for the City of New York, like they talk about the volunteer programs, which means they take our volunteers from us, right? Because people volunteer with them thinking they going to get over, which they generally do because they make certain allowances for this. But if people volunteer with the programs, then they should be able to ride the buses free. All of the things that the city has anything, and taxing, they should be free and absolved of that. If anything that the city has that it has--like surplus food--they should be the first to receive this, because they have given up their time and they should be paid for this, whether it's in the thing that we believe in--which is communicable exchange which is the law of barter--or in some type of recompense because there has to be a law of retribution somewhere. And that's why we are saying we need the community to be aware and alert that a lot of money we have that we spend falsely--because that's what we are saying--if we would then support our own community programs, we would then have the money to go back to them to get help. So we are talking about interexchange into the community.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:18:49.920
If anyone in the audience wants to contact Freedom Fund United, they should contact them at 501 West 145th Street, that's New York one hundred thirty one.

Andrew Henderson 00:19:01.111
Or, 192 Edgecombe Avenue. Or even more important, come past. We hoping in the next week or so, we'll have the phone back on, but we are not going to let them...that's another shakedown tactics. No, see I got to we've got to talk about these things because we don't have no pride because we started with nothing, and like we have a new building that we're trying to now deal with a four-story brownstone. We have been able to survive, been able to take 3,000 people...we haven't received a dime from anybody, yet and still people get paid for these type things...we don't receive administrative moneys, we don't receive any of these things, so we're saying that we are making the people aware that...unless people that really understand start supporting these type programs, the younger brothers and sisters cannot be encouraged to take the type of gambles that damn fools like us have taken.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:19:41.760
All right Lavenia, as a coordinator you're working with helping to get 192 Edgecombe together and the like. Do you actually have any responsibility in recruiting youngsters? Could you tell us how you get the youngsters involved in the program?

Lavenia Byer 00:19:57.600
Well I don't have that responsibility. Sister Naomi knows about that. I only know that once the youngsters get there, I take instruction from Sisters Naomi and then I do...you know, follows through whatever she suggests should be done. And the children are very, very responsive. They're very happy about it.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:20:18.501
Now in terms of recruiting though, do you recruit from the block, do you recuit from several blocks?

Andrew Henderson 00:20:23.241
Well, they come from everywhere. And what maybe you need to go...see when you talk about recruiting, see, the question you asked the sister stumped her--

Lavenia Byer 00:20:29.100
Yes--

Andrew Henderson 00:20:29.103
And it's stumped her because...this sister has a great amount of talent and ability that she hasn't even spoken on. See, all of the people that [are] working with us are demonstrated leaders. We have singers--this sister's an actor, she's a hell of a singer too--and this is the type of thing that we talking about. See, we not dealing with the structure of people taking jobs because they have degrees, and then trying to tell the kids that education is the only answer. We trying to take people like this, that don't have degrees, and give them as an example a role model...that because she can sing, she can dance, she knows drama. She knows and has the love of people. Most important of all, then her thing is to be able to make the young people have the type of feeling for senior citizens and other people in that community. Because the only way that you can recruit people--and I've been doing it for 20 years--the only way that you can recruit people is through demonstration of love. Now I've seen the city, I've seen all the big agencies, but the people always wake up to 'em at some given point and that's why they gotta keep recruiting.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:21:24.530
You used the word 'love'--could I translate that into 'commitment' as well?

Andrew Henderson 00:21:30.361
Well ,love is commitment. And I think if you asked that sister that question, she can give you a hell of an answer, either one of the ladies.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:21:35.671
All right well I'll ask you, Lavenia.

Lavenia Byer 00:21:37.020
Yes. It's...it's because I do care about the community, the neighborhood--the whole neighborhood--as a whole. And I have taken walking tours and spoken to the elders and the children, and the men and the women, so they know that I care about them as a fellow human. So that's what I'm working on. I've had training at Negro Ensemble, and I've had training in TV commercials by Maria Greco. I've had good training in the arts that I'm involved in--playwriting and Frank Silvera workshop. So I'm going to transfer this interest in culture, art, and acting and body care and health care, over to the children. Now what I've learned about health and things is through trial and error, being an elder--I am an elder, I'm 52--and I do want to give the youth my knowledge of body and health care as an example that they don't have to be withered and wrinkled by 52, you see? And they respond to me because they are curious about a long healthy life.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:22:38.850
That's very, very true. Now Jeanette, about the citywide aspect of Freedom From United--you are located in Harlem. But as we were talking before the program, you indicated that you have programs in Brooklyn and some in the Bronx and so on. How do you make your outreach to the citizens in the Brooklyn area, or in the Bronx area?

Jeanette Fields 00:23:01.621
By taking your time and going into it. There's no other way that you can have it done. Like Andrew said, we're all volunteers of this because we believe in this, and this is how we feel. And until more people feel this way we're never, you know, really going to accomplish it. And there are people out there that do feel this way. We have a love and deep compassion for the things that we see, that [we] know that can be rectified. And...I work. And besides working, I just moved out of Brooklyn and I moved into the Bronx. So then that gives me three open aspects. I have the people previously from Brooklyn, I'm working--naturally--in Manhattan, and the people now that I will be dealing with in the Bronx. Now in order to get these people, I go around and to the parents and ask you know concerned parents--there are a lot of mothers that don't work, on welfare and what have you. And they don't do anything really, in a day. They...they have been conditioned to this system thing of: you get the money, you send the kids to school...today [they] would like to be involved and do something like this. So on the programs that we have in a day where our people--our main people, as consultants and everything are busy--we can negotiate with the parents to take over the children on this outing or whatever, you know, cultural means we have. And then through doing that, we will pick up on other people that have knowledge and experience that is invaluable. You can't even buy it. The price...it's priceless for what you can do for the youth, or the senior citizens involved. Now through me going to Brooklyn, I would be...like, at home to operate there, more so than in Manhattan...because I'm here with Manhattan, but I'm more familiar with Brooklyn. And there's so many neighborhoods, I don't have to tell you, that needs Freedom Fund United Culture Train.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:24:55.050
One of the things that's apparent is that the whole city needs something like this. One of the things that came across my mind as I heard the three of you talking is that this is such a good idea. And whereas--with all due respect to you, it is innovative--there are a number of people who have been concerned with black developments, who have seen culture as a means of developing increased relationship between our people. Why is it that we haven't been able to make more progress among ourselves? I'm not talking about blaming The Man, as it were, but among ourselves to respect each other, to understand our culture.

Andrew Henderson 00:25:30.180
See, if you're talking about neocolonialism, if you're talking about apartheid, then you've got to understand: that's what's happening. See, people that live in this country, especially in New York City, black people are controlled fro A to Z through one mechanism or another by the system--that without them understanding they're controlled and manipulated from school age right to senior citizens age. I know time is running, so I'll go back and deal with it another way. You talk about the welfare mother. The welfare mother proved to the city, state, and federal government their capability was so strong because through the WINS program, they are now the forerunners of the CEDA program. But they get no credit for it, because it's still a negative image if you listen and believe what the media say. Yet and still more welfare mothers now are working--black and Hispanic, this is what gave the government the type of statistics it needed to bring in the work employment program that a lot of us now are benefiting by. So we're saying let's give them meaningful motivation with stimulation and leave outside agitation on its own.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:26:32.430
In other words, you're really saying that through the awareness and the motivation and the stimulation of knowing about our roots and our cultural experience, we are able then to get more of our people to interact among themselves for positive ends.

Andrew Henderson 00:26:49.471
But see we've got to be very careful, because as soon as we get people to interact and as soon as we get them to recognize, then the city takes them and gives them a job or a position that takes them away from the people. So we have people that fought for the civil rights--and I can name quite a few judges and lawyers--and then they would take them...and put against the people with the same knowledge. Everybody that we create, they negate. So we got to understand that this is all part of a master plan.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:09.931
But it doesn't necessarily automatically follow that if someone takes another kind of job, that they're gonna leave the community.

Andrew Henderson 00:27:16.201
See, you have to because The Ma nwhen he gives you another type of job, he makes sure that you're gonna leave the community. That's what's the purpose of the job. You could take--I don't wanna start naming no names. I can go down and name everyone that you've ever talked about--see this is the reality, because The Man does not want to see this work. Because...if we had a lot more money, what jobs would they have?

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:31.710
Yeah I understand point, but I guess I was trying to suggest that...within the black community there are a variety of lifestyles and a variety of levels of commitment--

Andrew Henderson 00:27:41.310
Sure there is--

00:27:41.313
and some people are more committed.

Andrew Henderson 00:27:42.661
Sure there is. And all of us gotta be careful about how committed because, like I say once The Man finds you committed, then he has a commitment for you.

Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr. 00:27:49.830
Again, as we come to the close the program, those in the audience who are interested in volunteering their services or making direct financial contributions should contact Freedom Fund United Foundation at 501 West 145th Street, that's New York 131. Or, 192 Edgecombe Avenue. Or, as Andy Henderson said, stop by and see what's going on.

Andrew Henderson 00:28:13.891
