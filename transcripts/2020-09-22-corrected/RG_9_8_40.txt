What is a bull market? What is a bear market? Why should black people be interested in the stock market? Here Stephen Goodwin, investment counselor, answers these questions on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Narrator 00:00:35.620
This is "Soul of Reason" a program that will examine the roots of the black thoughts. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:01:02.110
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Stephen Goodwin who is an investment executive with Hayden Stone and company. We're going to talk about the stock market and why black people should be interested in the stock market. Glad to have you with us tonight Stephen.

Stephen Goodwin 00:01:15.161
Well I'm glad to be here Dr. Brown.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:01:17.161
Ok well let's talk about the stock market. We use those terms, a tease, a bull market and the bear market, et cetera. A lot of people even though they hear about Wall Street, et cetera, don't really understand what the stock market is. So could we begin our discussion tonight by just you- having you briefly explain what the stock market is somewhat how it operates.

Stephen Goodwin 00:01:38.230
All right. The stock market basically is a place where American industry more or less uses as a mechanism to raise capital. Either to finance their own plant and equipment expenditures for the oncoming fiscal year or to do various kinds of improvement. Or either to roll over short term debt or do a variety of things which they may feel wouldn't enhance to a whole of their overall cash position.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:02:05.350
In other words, they're trying to get money to do something they want to do. And the market is the place where this money change is taking place.

Stephen Goodwin 00:02:12.610
The market is simply a mechanism by which, you know, corporations are able to come and auction off various kinds of securities whether it be debt instruments, equity instruments, preferred stock, debentures, first mortgage bonds, or whatever it may be.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:02:29.801
Now you really sound like an investment counselor. You ran off all those technical terms and that really is the reason why people get frightened of the stock market; debentures and this kind of business. Okay. So would you go through that again.

Stephen Goodwin 00:02:41.701
All right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:02:42.130
And then state exactly what each of these instruments of money exchange are.

Stephen Goodwin 00:02:45.641
Let me make it really simple. Assume x-y-z corporation decides that in 1975 they would like to add to their existing capacity. In order to do so, they find it necessary to issue long term debt. Well debt is simply, in layman's language, nothing but a bank loan. As opposed to going to the bank and asking for a loan for maybe 10 million dollars, x-y-z corporation decides it would be more advantageous to go to the market and attempt to encourage investors to buy their long term debt. 'We have a great deal of faith in x-y-z cooperation and its financial credibility, its own strength' and auction off that debt that way. Usually the difference between going to the bank and going to the to the market is that they may find that the either the bank loan may be higher than they anticipated, whereas the market costs of raising the money may be lower. Or there may be other little reasons which are really administrative reasons with regard to debt financing. So when they bring the issue to the market a person like you or me decides 'Well gee I'm really impressed with the the profit to grow- the growth expectations of x-y-z cooperation and the future this particular cooperation has in its own industry. I'd like to buy the debt, and besides its yielding 9 percent I don't get that on the bank savings a savings account. I don't get that on commercial paper. I don't get that on a C.D. Why not buy it? And it's a triple-A name.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:04:19.180
Now you talked about how the market helps the American industry raise money for its endeavors. Now what about the people who invest in the market, who provide this money for the loan in effect. How is most of that money made because you hear on the tapes and so on about the price of a stock going up and down and people making money by selling the stock. Now is that the main way in which the investor makes his money or this is the main way he makes his money from the dividends or the payment on the loan from the company that he buys a stock in?

Stephen Goodwin 00:04:54.330
Let's move back for a second here and look at three different approaches to investing. Number one you either can be a conservative investor. Number two you can be a very enterprising investor. Number three you can be very speculative investor. Now the only distinction between all three categories falls between the degree of safety and risk you're willing to take in any kind of investment venture. And it's really up to the individual to decide exactly as my posture- my approach to investing. Whether it be a speculative or very entrepreneurial or very conservative. Now for example a conservative investor would emphasize safety the preservation of his capital with regard to a stable rate of return on his money so he may be the kind of person who would buy American Telephone bonds Triple A name, you know very high and-

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:06:02.030
When you say Triple A, what does that mean?

00:06:03.431
That's the highest rating of a bond could possibly get.

Stephen Goodwin 00:06:06.340
That means some financial organization has evaluated it for-

00:06:10.000
Moody's or Standard and Poor's traditionally rates the, well, the financial viability of American corporations and attaches a rating to it, either it's A, double A, or a triple A, B double A and it goes right on down a scale. But a conservative investor and assessing whether he would like to obtain some debt instrument from a triple A corporation. Looking at the safety and the risk involved would more likely purchase an instrument like that.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:06:46.330
And his main source of return would be the dividends from that stock.

Stephen Goodwin 00:06:50.420
No no no. A debt instrument, the return is the interest income. If he had purchased a stock which pays a high dividend then your return would be on your investment would be the dividend income. But it's important to make that distinction because dividends are paid on stock and dividends are also paid on preferred stock and there are some dividends which are quarterly and some which are deferred dividends and some which are cumulative dividend payments. So it's important that the investor as we say on the street. Caveat emptor, let the let the buyer beware that. Hey, am I buying something that I receive a dividend three months from now or if the company forfeits such as Con Ed did, if you recall three months ago, when they omitted a dividend. Well that dividend will be made up in the third quarterly payment. Or will it be cumulative made up at the end of the year.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:07:46.960
Now you talked about a debt instrument. How does a debt instrument differ from stock per say.

Stephen Goodwin 00:07:53.360
A debt instrument... A stock instrument represents ownership in a particular corporation. A debt instrument is simply a loan to a corporation. The difference can be divided in three ways. Number one if the company goes bankrupt such as what we're seeing now at Penn Central or we saw that and what we're seeing a lot of other corporations around America. The first claim on the assets of the company on the earnings. Any assets- any assets of a corporations any earnings really of the profits here. And any assets are simply things like tables, chairs, cash would go to the bondholder and he would be hopefully a you'd have- he would have first lien if he was a first mortgage bondholder, he would had first lien on those assets. Now if there's anything left over you know after bankruptcy has been settled and so forth. Any AB personally was a stockholder we get it. We'll get what was ever left over use it that time. There's nothing left over. Most corporations go into some kind of reorganization and attempt to keep it going viable in such a way or either offer an option to bondholders or maybe stockholders where they can convert into bonds or either they try and have people who are bondholders or they, you know, well they usually try and get them either to upgrade the bonds or they give them a variety of things.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:09:34.801
By upgrade the bonds, what do you mean?

Stephen Goodwin 00:09:35.830
Well really what I meant is I assumed that you're in a situation like this where the company is about to go bankrupt and you are- you have a bond. And Bond has first lien on the assets and earnings of the cooperation or the cooperation may decide that included in the indenture, it was a simple clause that said if this bond is held at a certain period it automatically is convertible either into stock or after a certain period we can redeem the bonds we can buy them back ourselves. Well if any- if either process happens and automatically we'll be granted a ladder you're a stockholder and therefore you have last claim on the assets and earnings. If you are ever just redeem obviously you have no claim you are. You just get you- you just get whatever they want to pay you for it. And usually this is stipulated in the indenture. So it's you know it's important to know exactly- even if you are a bond holder- you know what obligations a cooperation has to you during the course, or during the life of the bond.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:10:44.030
And I think you've explained, in a very general way, the way in which the market operates. Now the question that we are particularly interested in, in Soul of Reason, as we are dealing with the black experience and that is: why should and would black people be interested in the market both as investment executives or counselors, as you are, and as investors themselves. Because it is alleged all kinds of things. The market uh- the people who are in the market the corporations have opressed black people, that they invest in places in Africa which are oppressive to black people and therefore blacks should not have anything to do with the market. Now-

Stephen Goodwin 00:11:25.731
Wait a minute you're going a litle too fast. Lets- Lets roll back again for a second. First whether black people invest in the market or do not invest in a market is not important. The most important thing here is to recognize, whether you're black or white you know, people who are policemen, sanitation men, who hold any public or civic office, and who receive a paycheck, they will notice in their paycheck certain money is excluded for their pension. Now this may be social security, your retirement, survivors, and whatever it may be, these proceeds are invested. So whether you're a fireman, a policeman, a sanitation man, and you look on your check, you know, those proceeds are being invested in such a way that when it's time for you to retire at age 55 or 65 you're going to get X dollars to supplement your Social Security retirement income. You ought to have some idea, number one, how this money is being invested. Number two, the kind of expected return you can get. Now, if you are an individual who decides that aside from that, you'd like to make a direct purchase in the market of either a debt or an equity instrument. Then there are certain advantages tax wise, there are certain advantages in terms of capital gains, which is simple appreciation of price of a stock and a host of financial services, you know, that can be accrued to you. But I would encourage people in particular... I would encourage people, you know, whether you're black, or white, involved, or are not directly involved, to be conscious of you know how the economy affects you and how it really affects your investment value of your own dollar.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:13:15.471
I see. Tonight we are talking with Stephen Goodman, who is an investment executive with Hayden Stone and company, about the stock market and the reasons why blacks might be involved in the market and some of the things that might happen from this. And Stephen, you just mentioned one thing I think that a lot of the people in the public are not aware of and that is that a considerable amount of the investments in the market come from large holdings such as pension funds from unions and governmental organizations. And even though the average man may not think that he is in the market, he really is because of the involvement of his pension funds in the market and in a certain way he might even have some control. Because one of the things that you had mentioned earlier was the fact that so much of what happens in our economy relates to what happens in the market. I don't think it's any secret to anyone today that we are in a state of inflation and we have some very serious economic problems. And if you look at the chart, then the market seems to be going down for the past four or five or six months. Now, first of all, what are some of the reasons for this. And secondly what, if anything, can the average investor- the average black investor, average black person, who is involved in the pension fund do to respond to this?

Stephen Goodwin 00:14:37.670
All right. You asked two questions there, let me take the first one. A lot of black people were involved in unions, for example. I happen to know in particular, the black trade union movement, here in New York City has a lot of their pension fund money divided among the various black and Puerto Rican and other minority banks. So obviously those deposits and savings banks are in savings and loan associations, enable those banks to make loans or maybe a of them to make mortgage money available to people in these respective communities or where ever the people may be. So, and that... And that... From that point of view that's a tremendous plus that these people are very conscious of how their pension money, you know, affects their own community and how they can have some direct hand, you know, in fostering economic growth in that area. The second question which has to do with what is what's gone wrong with the model and how can we respond to that. Well. This has been a very unusual.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:15:56.920
[Inaudible] But I like to hear your reflections.

Speaker 12 00:16:02.710
Well. Well the reason... The reason the market has been as depressed as it has been in and it's constantly deteriorating by three fold. Really four. One, the higher rate of inflation. Two, high interest rates. Three, the increasing oil bill we received from the Middle Eastern countries. Four, the international balance of payments problem, which means in some ways more money going to more money flowing out than coming in creating a greater deficit and lowers the value of the dollar against other European currencies.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:16:50.720
Well after having told us all of this, this would tend to indicate that this is probably not a good time for minority people, black people, people who have limited resources- not that all black people have limited resources- but the people who do not have a tremendous amount of wealth at their disposal to go into the market. Is that a fair statement or is it possible to really work the market even at this time and survive?

Stephen Goodwin 00:17:17.251
To go back to my original statement with regard to the three approaches to investing. I would definitely encourage black people who have not been exposed in the market-not been exposed to the market or been involved in the market, to be involved now and take a very conservative stance emphasizing safety of capital with a stable return on their investments. Those black people who were maybe in the middle 30s, 40s and have a great deal more disposable income to whip around in the market. There are tremendous opportunities now in the short and long term basis for capital appreciation. They would adopt you in part to posture. We're very entrepreneurial investor. I would definitely encourage some. Those people who are black or white who are thinking about the market irrespective of the problems I've outlined. There are tremendous gains to be made in a very speculative way and that is taking a great deal more risk than you would take either as an entrepreneur or adopting a conservative posture. And that is to say you're buying and selling more frequently over a shorter period of time to create a larger capital gain for yourself than you might normally create. Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:18:43.680
Well what kind of effect would it have on the market if a number of people began to speculate? Wouldn't that cause the market to really be so disrupted that things really get worse rather than get better.

Stephen Goodwin 00:18:57.201
Well, one I'm not sure what you mean by speculate.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:18:59.631
Because you said in the latter category that they would be more speculative, more risk taking. Risk taking means that you have a chance of losing a lot or have a chance of making a lot. And in terms of a constant downtrend, what you're doing is saying all the stocks are going to lose.

Stephen Goodwin 00:19:17.570
Yeah. You know somehow or another it's been inculcated into the general public's thinking that you can only make more money when the market goes up. You know there's no difference between a 15 point decline in the D.J. as there is to a 15 point plus in the DJ.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:19:38.661
For the uninitiated, it would indicate the Dow Jones Industrial.

00:19:44.601
You know whether it goes either way, there is money to be made. It is simply understanding how money is being made. Now I'll give you a very good example. About a month ago, I was shorting Avon at forty four.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:20:00.112
By shorting, again remember we are talking to the public that is not necessarily always familiar to these terms.

Stephen Goodwin 00:20:05.691
Oh when you short a stock, it's almost the same as buying a stock when the market's going up. But in effect when you short stock, what you are doing is you're- you're selling something you really don't own with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price. But really, it's simply the opposite of a flip of the coin of buying a stock in a bull market as opposed to buying in a bull market anticipating a rise. You're selling in a bear market anticipating a decline and making the profit on the spread there.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:20:40.790
Now the spread. That means the difference between what you sell it at-

Stephen Goodwin 00:20:43.341
And what you buy it back at.

00:20:44.552
What you buy it back at and you can and in that sense actually make money when the stock is going down. But if that happens too often in an economy, we're really in bad shape.

Stephen Goodwin 00:20:55.010
Well Avon used to be around one hundred forty three. Eastman Kodak around one hundred and forty three also and a lot of these stocks were really selling at multiples. We call them, these are price earnings relationships greatly an exaggeration of their own growth potential or their real earnings potential but what-

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:21:15.201
Is part of inflation, in a sense?

Stephen Goodwin 00:21:17.570
Well I think in this particular instance what was happening here is that they were really the the darlings of the institutions. A lot of the money center banks and the media banks across the country had what they call their favorite top 50 and that's all they ever bought. You know, they didn't buy anything else. It wasn't an Avon, Eastman Kodak, a Schlumberger, or International Paper. This was all they bought, you know, and we really had a two tier market. Only those stocks went up. IBM and everything else just stayed right where it was no matter what. You know, the market had been roaring and the market was at ten fifty three. There's still some stocks at twenty three that just went to twenty four, twenty five. Whereas you know-

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:21:58.990
Well like you said, suggesting, that maybe what appears to be a recession or a semi- recession is in a sense- in a sense a reordering of economic priorities because I've seen the statements from several institutions that invest money and have some very wise investors and all of them are on the negative side. Now if I were to accept your logic that even though the market is going down, if there had been some skillful investment some of them would have had their whole account on the positive side.

Stephen Goodwin 00:22:28.970
Well you know that's... Let me get back to the... What I was really saying about how money is made in a down market and then I will answer, in my own opinion what a skillful investing on a part of these institutions. First of all getting back to the Avon situation. I had shorted the stock and I had bought a call against my bought an option against my own position. Now what this simply means is this. I'm betting that it's going to go from forty four, you know, to zero or say twenty three. And in the event that I'm wrong, I'm also buying an option, which gives me an opportunity in the event the stock went up to cover my position.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:23:09.441
By cover your position, you mean to buy-

Stephen Goodwin 00:23:11.512
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:23:11.514
-this stock at the better, the new price.

Stephen Goodwin 00:23:14.572
Right. Or it will really buy it at the market price at that time I shorted, okay. The dawn stock went from 44 to 35. I covered my position and then the stock dropped around 23, 24. Well hey I made a nice piece of change that, uh, my clients made a lot of money. Now this is an example of how money can be made in a bear market and it can be made more rapidly than it can be made in a bull market because the turnover money, I think, is faster and peoples psychology is such that let's just get out of stock and the stock is moving down like this. It was on a rollercoaster. Now a lot these institutions. I don't know. I've talked to a lot of people and they seem to have a kind of a psychology that, well if you looked at Rockefeller's portfolio over the weekend in the New York-

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:24:07.840
Which was published in the New York Times

Stephen Goodwin 00:24:08.600
- Right. In the New York Times, they even indicated that this guy had been doing things the way it had been done in 1930 and nothing really has been changed. No, to more or less, enhance the value or the income or the interest income from the portfolio in terms of the 40s, the 50s, or the 60s. And traditionally what has been the attitude of investment counselors and managers is to adopt on policy and that's just the way things go on and on and on. And people are not really sensitized to the fact that times change, economies change, markets change, and people's values with regard to the market and how to play it have to change also.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:24:46.911
But see that's the reason why I asked if this slight recession or a considerable recession is a function of changing of economic priorities or is it really indicative of the fact that the nation is in economic trouble? In that we either have to pay more for some of our foreign investments or our foreign natural resources and we're getting a stabilization. For example you say the oil is one of the big price, one of the big things that's causing the economic problem. Well we've been dipping into these countries and taking their oil for a little bit of money for a long time and now that the world balance of trade is beginning to balance up maybe what we're experiencing is the fact that the high standard of living we had been able to support in the United States at the expense of the rest of the world is beginning to balance out and in a sense the decline in the market represents a re-ordering of the economic priorities of the nation and of the world. Is that a reasonable explanation or is it just a short term problem of the fact that we haven't- by we I mean our economy- hasn't managed its money well.

Stephen Goodwin 00:25:56.431
Makes a lot of sense and it sounds like it could be acceptable.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:26:00.211
Because one of the things that everyone, particularly the black community, is concerned about is how do we re-establish an economy where every time you get a raise you don't have to spend twice as much as a raise for food, clothing, shelter, and other things.

Speaker 17 00:26:15.040
Well the black community has been in a depression for years. I mean when we ever had a a period of prosperity, we were in a period of depression.

00:26:21.361
That's right. [Inaudible].

00:26:22.761
We're in a depression. I mean it's, you know, like what can I say.

Stephen Goodwin 00:26:29.760
You know, like, I know how I feel we we ought to think about how to organize the economic goals of the black community and how we ought to utilize our own capital and labor and other resources more efficiently to achieve our own investment objectives that I think would be most viable.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:26:46.921
For example.

Stephen Goodwin 00:26:48.780
Well...

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:26:48.784
Yes we really would like to know. Could you give us a statement? We would really like to know.

Stephen Goodwin 00:26:56.011
All right. You know, I. Oh well for example with regard to the unemployment situation, for example. The president made it clear he would have a public employment program. If the, if the econ- if the unemployment rate hit 6 percent. Well in the black community, it's been at twice that for quite some time now. It's been around 12 13 percent on general, for teenagers it has been around 35 percent. Well this kind of public employment programs should've been enacted a long time ago for that community.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown Jr 00:27:25.681
Okay I think you've hit the nail right on the head. In other words, in looking at the economic situation from your vantage point as an investment executive you can see certain ways in which the financial priorities of the nation can be reordered, and you can also see how black people and black organizations by using their money more skillfully with each other investing in their own endeavors, banks, interchange and so on can improve the economic condition of blacks. I'd like to thank our guest Stephen Goodwin investment executive from Hayden Stone and company discussing with us the intricacies of the stock market and why it is important for black people to be involved and knowledgeable about that market.
