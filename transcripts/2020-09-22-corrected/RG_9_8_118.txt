Recognition of the black artist is increasing throughout the nation. Many black artists and sculptors in New York City have recently opened galleries. Here, Anderson Pigatt, black artist, discussed the role of the black artist on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:37.080
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black artist. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:04.501.0000000000073
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Anderson Pigatt, who is a, uh, black sculptor who has recently opened a gallery in the Soho area of New York City. Glad to have you with us tonight, Andy.

Anderson Pigatt 00:01:15.601
Yes, good evening.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:17.191
Could you...uh... begin the show by talking about just how you got into sculpting and what you personally gain from it, and then we'll talk something about your gallery.

Anderson Pigatt 00:01:27.660
Well, it seems [laughs] I've always...was interested in sculpting. At five years old, I started painting...and then, it was my first form of communication that was approved by my mother and father. They used...I used to draw pictures, and they used to say, "Oh wow, that looks just like me," or "just like..(someone)." So it was the first form of communication. Then I went through a lifetime to find out that this was the only way that I really...enjoyed, ah, communicating, you know, some of my thoughts. I went from singing, the rhythm and blues, rock- and-roll area, and I went all the way through, ah, the Army, and I went to school for general wood work and did carpentry, from carpentry to cabinet making, from cabinet making I was apprenticed for four years under James W. Leach, refinishing, repairing, uh antique furniture such as Chippingdale, Heppingwhite, Trenton, you know the whole thing. So...I finally got tired of doing ball and claws for chairs, and doing pieces of Art Nouveau carving, and I just decided one day that there must be something of a higher plane for me to do. And I's just start carving on my own one day...I found this half piece, ah, piece of sculpture that was half finished, and I had my tools in the workshop, and I decided that uh, I'd try to fix this statue; and I planned to uh, you know start to doing more work on this statue. Before I knew it, I was...totally involved in reshaping it, reforming it, and making it so...that I could make it into my own statue. And when I finished with it was called "Nigger Chained..." and I was...I worked day and night. It was one of the biggest orgasm I ever had in my whole entire life, and I really enjoyed...working on it because I saw something that I was doing for the first time, that I really want to do. [Clears throat] It was like a long lost friend of mine had came back to me to say hello. And...ah, that's how I got back into wood carving.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:49.110
Of course, in those words you've described the, the feeling of...so many artists. Erh, on "Soul of Reason," we've had many artists--uh, sculptors, painters, musicians, um, uh, people who've, ah, worked with wire, and so on, and, in in almost every instance... they express in words the type of feeling that you have just expressed: that it's something of yourself coming out in something that remains, for other people, and you, to appreciate. And...to me, uh, although I'm not an artist, I can identify with that particular kind of feeling...uh, that when you look at that, you say that's something of me that I have projected...

Anderson Pigatt 00:04:29.222
Uh huh...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:29.224
And uh, particularly since you work mainly in wood...

Anderson Pigatt 00:04:32.521
[overspeak] Always...in wood, always in wood...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:32.527
rather than working plaster and clay. That's very, very very interesting.

Anderson Pigatt 00:04:37.682
[clears throat]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:38.670
Now, in terms of the...topical material... you know, what you do your sculptures about...What type of things have you emphasized in your sculpture work?

Anderson Pigatt 00:04:49.221
Well...it ranges from ah, pieces that subconsciously, ah, reached to consciousness as, uh...s-slavery, s-uffering, uh, the black experience...uh, I've reached even a higher planes, on like on my new pieces...uh, I began to try to talk of a universal kind of a knowledge, which is to...be able to communicate to people in Japan as well as people in, uh, Latin America or Mexico, that is outside of the black and white content, that it make it more universal, uh, more universally recognizable.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:41.090
But what is a universal theme? I can see that, for example, if you're doing a piece about slavery, and you have chains, or...

Anderson Pigatt 00:05:47.031
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:47.033
a person who is in an oppressed position, and and and is fighting back trying to pull out, now, give an example of a piece of sculpture that would have a universal meaning to it.

Anderson Pigatt 00:05:58.370
One, would be, ah, the different... in, uh, colors...the colors of Western world, Old Masters...uh, competing with ah, Egyptian colors, or of the early American Indian colors, which would be more basically, primarily flat basic of the seven colors, which is not, ah, added, blended, colors.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:30.280
In other words, there would be...uh, more of a basic red, or yellow...

Anderson Pigatt 00:06:34.571
Right. The seven flat colors.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:37.331
As against, uh, as you say, the more developed, uh...Westerns, where they, you have more shades, and tints...

Anderson Pigatt 00:06:45.590
[drawn out] Yes, but...yeah, shades and tints, but they more blended and mixed more colors too than adding more to it. And you have to remember, in the earlier [clears throat] in the earlier years, ahh, the Indians, they just, ah, the colors were made primarily used from fruits. The earth colors, ah, from the earth, and leaves, and all the, say, cherries would make uh, red. And that's what they originally used.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:15.810
Now that takes care of the color. And what about the figures themselves? What kind of figures do you develop that reflect the sort of the universal culture?

Anderson Pigatt 00:07:24.570
Well, uh...universal culture would mean like, like there's no real way that I can really say now, as a contemporary artist, because, uh, I'm still living in a kind of a content which I have not yet uh...uh...was able to, is able to move to find out the complete completion or whether or not I am communicating. However, I have had, ah, people come into my gallery, Chinese and Japanese from other culture, and they seem to understand exactly what I'm saying, uh, in this culture. But also, you have to understand that a lot of these people are also influenced by Western world thinking too, so they speak English, so they have to understand it. It's...I-I cannot really say whether or not I really, uh, reach in the mainstream of any other culture...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:25.181
Of course, that's one of the difficulties of talking about art. We've had many artists, uh, including Benny Andrews, who's been very active...

Anderson Pigatt 00:08:31.251
[overspeak] Yes he's a very good friend of mine...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:31.666
[overspeak] in prison art...on the show. And as we talk about this and, as you probably know, I-I have a television program on the arts, and and on television you can show the piece...

Anderson Pigatt 00:08:41.111
All right...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:41.113.00000000005821
...and you can talk about it,

Anderson Pigatt 00:08:42.280.9999999999418
yeah

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:42.283
and relate

Anderson Pigatt 00:08:42.971
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:42.972.9999999999418
to it, whereas on radio you have to give those verbal, uh, descriptions...

Anderson Pigatt 00:08:48.010
all right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:48.012
uh, without the artform being there. I have seen some of your work, and I uh, know of the formation of your gallery, and I believe some of your... early community-based work came out of the squatters who were on the site of the, state office building at A Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street

Anderson Pigatt 00:09:05.621
yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:05.623
...and uh Seventh Avenue. Could you tell us more about that?

Anderson Pigatt 00:09:09.110
Yeah. Well, uh that's one of my pet, ah, peeve, and we are having a big argument in the community. I was also...uh, I was asked one time, when they was forming this show...of completion for state competition. I was told no one asked me to be there. So I wasn't commissioned to do this piece. However, the spirit moved in me.. so...so fast that I found myself there, in the middle of something I knew absolutely nothing about. However, uh, uh, many years back and now as I look back over the period of time, I-I've seemed to capture it completely in three little figures. I mean when I walked there, there was police all on the outside, and there were people on the inside with baseball bats and machetes, and I was just there visiting to pick up a statue. And at that time there was a doctor Thomas Matthew who was in charge of Negro. And when I walked there there were so many people that impressed me. There was Baraka, at that time was called LeRoi Jones, and there was, ah...so many and

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:30.461
Kenyatta...

Anderson Pigatt 00:10:31.461
Kenyatta, and uh, Jeddah... and people I was just highly moved to see hundreds and hundreds of young black people from all over the Earth coming there to take part in something, and many came there to fight. Some came to die... but they were all there as one.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:53.751
Now to to refresh the ah audience's mind, when you're talking about the site of the... now New York State office building, which uh is right at A Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street and 7th Avenue, a lot of people...uh go there for various events. But at the time when this was uh contemplated as one of Rockefeller's project, it did involve leveling a whole block, a key block in Harlem, and a number of people opposed it, because they felt that it did not, uh, represent the community and it actually brought about moving things away from the community. So as a result, people like yourself, many activists, occupied the site...and said You'll have to move us off. And I believe they occupied that site for some six, seven, eight months...

Anderson Pigatt 00:11:35.870
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:35.872
before building had started. Now that the building is there, one of the parts of the contract was that 1 percent of the construction costs would be spent on artwork, and I recall at the dedication of the building, one of your pieces was uh, really celebrating that site. I forget the name of the piece...

Anderson Pigatt 00:11:54.140
"In Honor of the Brothers and Sisters of Reclamation Site Number One."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:58.101
That's right. It was a very interesting piece. It had a variety of colors, a variety of uh, positions of the people who were involved in those, in that particular struggle. And now, right at this very moment, you and many other sculptors and artists are involved in a competition... to uh...uh...get some

Anderson Pigatt 00:12:19.521
[overspeak] compete

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:19.523
support for your work. I believe there's a hundred and eighty thousand dollars that's been appropriated...for art work, ah, I believe mainly sculptures.

Anderson Pigatt 00:12:27.591
[overspeak] yeah [unintelligible]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:27.594
What you're going. [overspeak] Is a sculpture...

Anderson Pigatt 00:12:29.891
[overpeak] Sculptures, murals, eh, all kind of every form of visual art and we'll be competing...

00:12:35.600
and there are a number of artists, 'cause I've talked to a number of the black artists around town, who have prepared, uh, prospecti for...that particular competition, and I believe the other day you told me that you were in, in the uh midst of getting something ready also.

Anderson Pigatt 00:12:49.460
Yes. Well, I meant I, I have a piece that would be universally, in my opinion, would be very very good for the people. One of the things about the whole, the whole movement of uh the site was... there are people who said this was of no importance at all. And it was very very important. One of the importance is, in that riot, the rebellion of the state office building, it brought about the people, and the people became... and it brought about the recognition of Adam Clayton Powell, which is no longer now Seventh Avenue. It is now entitled [overspeak; unintelligible]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:33.394
[overspeak] Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Boulevard. Could you tell us, uh, where your gallery is located?

Anderson Pigatt 00:13:39.290
My gallery is in the midst of SoHo and it's in One Twenty-seven Green Street, between Houston and Prince.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:47.130
Uh, we are talking with Anderson Pigatt, and we're talking about the uh role of the black sculptor and the black artists in this new revolution in black art. And Andy, you were just saying that you have a gallery which is located on Greene Street, which is in SoHo, and I know a number of artists in Soho, practically all of them white. Are there any particular difficulties that a black artist has in opening his gallery and uh, operating in an area like Soho, other than the usual difficulty of money, or is money the real difficulty?

Anderson Pigatt 00:14:20.390
Yes. Money is the most difficult, but there is other reasons. One is that there is a cultural revolution that is being waged throughout the universe. And one of the trouble is at this time is re-educating black people to appreciate art as an investment, and to be able to understand what the artist is saying. Secondly, is that the...the White audience...must also begin to invest in ah, what the artist is doing, making a business investment, and not so much as, uh, something they really like in the past or not this must compromise and work two ways. One, with this ideas or thoughts of uh his own satisfaction, which is his subconscious, and then, he would have to work for a selling market, now, uh, which would kill a lot of time. The artist nowadays should be saying things that is pertinent to all life...that uh, both black people, white people can ah both enjoy our universal meaning...and the sense that the artist has the right to say what he want to say and it should be that they should be able to appreciate a statement coming from a black man as well as a black man except in a statement coming from a white man.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:06.380
You said a number of things in that dialogue and I think they are very important things you've pointed up the conflict that is traditional with the artist in terms of his aesthetic needs and his economic need, the need to express himself and at the same time the need to sell. You also pointed out the fact that uh black people in general yet have not developed a culture of buying a lot of art, and several artists who've been on our program have pointed this up. In addition, you point up that uh many white people don't either appreciate black art of this sense of wanting to buy it, or don't understand the statements that black art is trying to make. You further pointed up the universality of art and artistic statements. Uh, we were talking earlier about your attempt to reflect this...universality, and you said you do it largely through colors, but as a sculptor you also do it through form...

Anderson Pigatt 00:17:02.591
shapes and forms

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:03.431
and I imagine those forms that you are dealing with are forms that might have their roots in African culture, or in oriental culture, or in South American culture, as well as the more traditional angular shapes that we see in um, Western European and North American culture. Is that what you're trying to do as you develop this universality or are you really trying to deal with political and social themes?

00:17:27.611.0000000001164
Well, uh, one doesn't really start out doing...anything, or one should not go set out to do one particulary thing. If he does, then as consciousness, and if he's doing it for consciousness, he is misleading, because he has a reason to do it, only for his sheer... whatever his reason is...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:51.641
[overspeak] for, for it. Are you saying that...when an artist paints consciously, he's doing it more for commercial reasons

Anderson Pigatt 00:17:57.431
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:57.433
than for reasons of basic self-expression.

Anderson Pigatt 00:17:59.660
right, right. Yeh, actually, uh, for me, uh, art is, uh...a reference book. It's like, when I do one piece, uh, I come...I don't know...what I'm doing as much as...uh...I, let me [laughs] th..jus kidding... Let me get this thing straight, because I really want to try to get this...to tell you, the subconsciousness of being ...and ah, being is that uh, when I'm doing a piece at this time...10 years from now, I will understand what I was saying at this time. And at this time, ah, I may, or may not be able to...really consciously appreciate...the thought that I am working on at that time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:52.412
Well, you're developing your point, that particularly, the um, the visual artist that also deals with shape and form and color...has difficulty...saying...in a sense, the m-musical artist has...the same problem, uh, the musical artist says, well I put these sounds together, and...they m-mean something to me. Uh, the uh visual artists, uh the perceptual artists are saying well look, this is the way I feel, and this is what my feeling...leads me to express in my form of art. And if the person who is watching the art other than myself...uh interprets it a certain way, so be it. And I have expressed my feeling, and of course this the reason why protest art is so difficult to really deal with...because many times, when you're involved in protest art you are...consciously trying...to, protest, which

Anderson Pigatt 00:19:42.191
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:42.193
...is...one of the problems with protest art. Some of the [inhale] best prostest art has been the art, for example, your...business about these, the reclamation site... and you described...earlier, how this really came out of your feeling... you didn't go there to protest.

Anderson Pigatt 00:19:57.631
I read that they get a tre...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:00.181
[Laughs] You went there...alright... but when you got into it, you found that uh your expressions, in the form of this piece that you developed...uh, which you carved... became a form of protest, as other people looked at it and saw it. I-I think that that's a uh, about as far as you can go...until, as you say, you look back 10 years, and begin to say, Well yes at that time, I was into this particular thing and I think this shows...what I was trying to say. But let's go...on to the business aspect of it, or the

Anderson Pigatt 00:20:30.710
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:31.111
aspect of the economic aspect...that you're saying that...if art is going to survive this uh, uh...artistic revolution is going to continue to grow, more people in our society, white and black, has to appreciate art a-and acquire it, and by acquiring it, uh...pay a uh going market price for it...because that is the thing that enables the artist to live, And er because he's able to live, then he can create. And I know when you start a gallery like yours, whatever resources you have, uh the only way you can keep that gallery going...a place where people can come and watch art and buy art is to have some people buying it. And that's really the point you're making, I believe.

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:11.760
Yeah...Well, actually tech- ah technically also, that uh...we need like, I'm the only black art gallery in the whole SoHo district. I have about four hundred fifty black artists... that, in the past, had had nowhere to take their work at all...One of the

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:32.681
in, in Soho

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:33.391
yeah

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:33.393
because I believe there are some other galleries around...

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:35.430
[overspeak] In Soho... yes but uh, what I'm say in the Soho district, yes, excuse me... But ah, there's this uh, JAM gallery up in Midtown, there's uh, galleries all over, there's uh...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:46.401
[overspeak] Axa Art Gallery...

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:48.690
[overspeak] Axa, a lot... There's millions of art galleries.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:50.940
I wish there were millions, there're a lot of em.

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:55.771
[laughter] Well, I would say millions...there's, just in reference,

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:55.779
I know [laughs]...

Anderson Pigatt 00:21:57.073
But an and...it still turns out that...when the black artist, and the pairs did his work, he had to carry it to the market...and the market was controlled by this uh, by the....

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:12.691
the white artistic community..

Anderson Pigatt 00:22:13.550
Right. And uh, this is one of the reason why...they would say, my clients do not like this kind of work. And they had a right to say that, because they were businessmen in their business ah, ah venture. They was out to make money. And so they had to please their audience. But uh, at this time, we are, we're fast finding more and more people among the black people who are now in the 25 or 30 thousand dollar bracket, that have began to appreciate that. Uh, and I think that uh, uh...sooner or later, uh, black artists...will not have to only uh depend upon the white market, but uh, we can create an art, a market among our own people. But before that time, I think that there will have to be re...educational experience among all of, uh among our people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:16.380
Of course, one of the things that we do on "Soul of Reason" is to do exactly this...to make an opportunity for black people who have statements to make about a variety of things, whether they be art or politics, or health or education or music, uh, to do that. Uh, on the other hand, it is very important for us to realize...that...even as we became, become more aware...of these considerations, we have to know that the world that we live in is an economic world. In other words,

Anderson Pigatt 00:23:45.811
[overspeak] it's

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:45.813
a [inaudible] the Pigatt Galleries cannot exist...without people going and acquiring art. And um, r-right at this particular point in time, in our society, most of the people, even though there are some blacks who are acquiring art, most of the people who are acquiring art, who are buying significant pieces, pieces that cost three, four, or five, ten, twenty thousand dollars, are people who are white or...institutions. For example, we know that a number of businesses...uh...public buildings, such as The uh, uh New York State Office Building at A Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street and, correctly stated, Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard... [laughter] um, now have money, to buy art. There, there are very few buildings that open without...some money for art, and particularly in the public domain, since it is public money, Black artists should be competitive, not only in the state office building in Harlem, but they should be competitive for some of the other state and federal facilities. Do you know of any other public buildings, where black artists have had an opportunity to compete, in terms of getting some of the artistic commissions?

Anderson Pigatt 00:24:52.901
Well yes, this uh, model program throughout the United States, that is uh, being...just just recently, there is down at a special service in Washington, D.C., which has set aside...money for blacks in black communities...other words, what is happening is that ah...when one go into, to Chinatown, you know you there because you see... the telephone booths are all designed and are like that of China. And when you go into, Little Italy, you know you in Little Italy because of the Italian movement. But when you go to...black communities, there has been an only...uh, abstract forms, of representation for the black people. And uh, at this time, it is now becoming aware that uh, the people in the community, themselves, did not like what the artists were saying, other word, they did not, uh, they couldn't live with it. One must learn to live with the piece, and love the piece to get there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:09.080
That's an interesting point, because uh, artists are always telling me this...that even though you don't like it, you have to like [laughs] it. And that really isn't exactly the word, but when you say you don't understand, or like this expression, yet it's art, and if you look at it long enough, you'll eventually like it. I've seen some pieces I've looked at for 20 years, and I still don't like.

Anderson Pigatt 00:26:28.900
[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:28.902
So, the question is, really is, uh, what do you really mean in terms of the black community has to begin to understand, could you develop that a little bit?

Anderson Pigatt 00:26:38.590
Well, I'll try to uh actually, the appreciation of black art is at the one, uh, say after 400 years of oppression, which had removed the mind that says, I like me because I like me, because I find me beautiful. Then the other people who says I dislike me because I find other people beautiful. Now that is a conflicts right there...because all of black people do not like black work simply because they are not proud of themselves. And this is one of the things that I feel that must be in the community to bring about togetherness.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:21.280
And of course, what you're also saying is that as...we talk about what the art means and as people who view the art get a chance to talk with each other about it they may not like every single piece,

Anderson Pigatt 00:27:33.281
right

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:33.283
but they may understand the cultural theme that runs through a group of pieces. And I think it...is important for black people to support galleries, and other people, that we want to make that very clear, because it is the support of the general m-movement... involving black artists. And again, your gallery is located uh, at what address in Soho?

Anderson Pigatt 00:27:52.901
At One Twenty-seven Green Street, and that's between Houston and Prince Street, uh, our hours are from ten to six, seven days a week. And also, I like to say at this time... our audience is mostly white.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:10.910
I see...and that's probably true in a great deal of the art work. And at the Pigatt Galleries, I believe you have work of some 400 black artists, or 400 pieces of work of black artists, and there's a tremendous amount that the public can view. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Anderson Pigatt, a black sculptor, and we've been talking about the role of the black artist, in the black cultural revolution.
