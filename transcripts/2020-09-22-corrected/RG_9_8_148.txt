Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:22.150
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the black poet. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, in association with the Community Affairs Department of WNBC Radio and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:00:56.475
With us tonight on "Soul of Reason" is Christopher Edley who is executive director of the United Negro College Fund, who as we said helps to support 41 of the 108 Black colleges in the United States. Glad to have you with us tonight Chris.

Christopher Edley 00:01:10.330
Nice to be with you Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:01:12.160
Well 1975 is going to be a tough year. 1974 was a rough year, and '75 is probably going to be rougher. And when we say rough we're talking about rough economically, we're talking about rough politically, and we're talking about rough conceptually and philosophically; and particularly in terms of the black colleges, who have provided such a tremendous amount of intellectual resource, and black community in this country. The times are getting tougher and tougher, and the role of your fund is to help them to survive. So could you begin very briefly by telling us what are some of the objectives of the Fund for 1975?

Christopher Edley 00:01:50.980
Well the key objective is always to raise a large sum of money to support these schools. In 1975, we hope that we can raise thirteen and a half million dollars. We do not know at this time precisely the amount of money that we have raised in 1974.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:02:08.289.99999999998545
Of course not because the end of the year accounting is always tough.

Christopher Edley 00:02:10.390.99999999998545
We close our books on January 10th but we think that we have done slightly better than we did a year ago when we raised ten and a half million dollars. The thirteen and a half million dollar goal is significantly less than the total amount of money that the 41 private black colleges that are members of the College Fund will require to eliminate potential deficits in their operating budgets. We have been preparing for the 1975 campaign for over six months even as we were winding up in '74. The economic indicators, the 'prognosticators' of the economic scene, have certainly frightened us. Their prospects and predictions for 1974 were not nearly as drastic on our fundraising as it had been for some organizations and we were hoping that there is growing recognition of the importance of the education of minorities in this country and that this accounts for it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:03:18.830
But one thing, fundraising itself is a very complex activity, and as we were saying before the program began, sometimes the rich get richer. Not that the Black colleges are 'rich,' or the Fund is 'rich.' But when you have an organizational network, when you have a track record, when you are able to do the type of things that you and other staff members of the Fund do, it does tend to put you out front. At same time, as money gets tighter, now the competition for that money increases. Education has a very high priority in the Black community, but I would surmise that a goodly amount of the money which you raise comes from sources other than the Black community, which means that you have to be able to sell the importance of Black higher education. Is my surmise correct, the fact that more of your money comes from outside of the Black community than from inside of the Black community?

Christopher Edley 00:04:14.510
Oh yes you are absolutely correct. We are very much concerned about this. We believe that the economic status of Blacks has reached the point in the country where we should be getting larger sums from the black community, and we have already started intensive efforts to cultivate better giving patterns on the part of Blacks. Blacks have traditionally given money to churches but they have not built up the charitable traditions that exist in some of the other ethnic groups in this country. And we feel that it's part of our responsibility to help to cultivate this charitable aspect. It will benefit the College Fund of course but it will benefit many other very worthy minority causes. The white community has been very very generous in the support of the Black colleges. That isn't to say that we're getting as much as we need. But we do have to give recognition of that. For example, some 45 percent of our funds come from corporations. That's a tremendous sum of money. In 1974 it will be in the neighborhood of 4.2 million dollars, and the corporations of the country have supported the College Fund to the tune of 40 to 50 percent of our budget ever since our formation in 1944.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:42.930
Now of course that relates to something that deals with the demographics of the statistics about Black colleges. Approximately 38 of them, I believe, are state-related in some fashion, and then some 42 private accredited colleges.

Christopher Edley 00:05:58.651
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:59.041
And your fund helps to support 41 of those. That's right. In other words, your fund does not contribute directly to any of the state-supported or local-supported colleges.

Christopher Edley 00:06:11.131
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:06:12.061
And there's a reason for that of course.

Christopher Edley 00:06:13.561
Of course. They have the latest federal aid money right coming through and we feel that the pressure for improving state-supported schools should properly be on the governing authorities and the tax money dispensers after it's been collected.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:06:30.820
One of the interesting things that I've observed is that today at least the larger black colleges are state-supported, which in a sense comes from the fact that they can rely on the state treasury, and in a sense, having more money, they have in some instances a broader variety of programs. Many of the private colleges, all these really superior Black private colleges, tend to be smaller, and tend to really be struggling to educate those youth they deal with.

Christopher Edley 00:07:02.911
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:07:03.331
And I imagine that really puts you and the Fund under the gun to give these folks survival money, because one of the things I want to talk about a little later on is the whole question of survival of the Black college.

Christopher Edley 00:07:15.690
Well you know, our schools have 46,000 Black students, which is a large segment when you consider the total pie, the total number of Black students who are enrolled in colleges today. And increasingly our students are coming from poorer and poorer family backgrounds. In fact some 65 percent of these 46,000 students come from families with total income of less than 5,000 dollars a year. And those figures are creeping up, which means that the students who are admitted to our schools are not part of a creaming operation. These are kids who have shown that they can perform at the college level and have no financial withal to get there without the support that they receive through the United Negro College Fund and the other funds that the schools are able to muster.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:08:12.291
It's an interesting historical picture, because sometime right after World War Two, approximately fifty five percent or more of all Black youth who were going to college went to predominately black institutions. And now it's switched around so that some 70 or 75 percent, I think one statistic I read about freshmen said something like 80 percent, of Black youth entering college in '73 entered what we would call predominately white colleges. Now it's true that some of them weren't predominately white because they were public supported colleges in Black communities in the North. But this represents a tremendous shift in the balance of trade as it were between predominantly Black and predominately white colleges with the consequence that you mentioned earlier of some of the more able students being moved into the predominantly white institutions, and leaving some of the poorer economically, and sometimes less prepared (not necessarily less intelligent) Black youth to be worked with with black institutions. Yet at the same time the budget crunch gets harder and harder on these black institutions to do a job which is increasingly more expensive, namely to take young people who have academic problems and deficiencies and poor backgrounds, and bring them into the mainstream of college life. What does the future hold? We talked about your target for '75 which is 13 and a half million dollars which is certainly a good positive target, but I'm sure that the presidents and the boards of these institutions and the Fund, must have given some thought to what's going to happen, and not necessarily in 1975, or what's going to happen in 1985, what is the prospect? Philosophically, obviously Black institutions are needed. Financially, the question is can they survive?

Christopher Edley 00:10:13.401
I don't think there's any question but that they can survive. I recently saw a listing of the colleges in the United States which closed in 1973, just a year ago. And that listing showed some 200 colleges closing, and there wasn't a single Black college on the list. There are colleges closing every day in the United States. Every week, in any event. And these are not the Black colleges. When you consider the fact that the Black colleges have survived the post Civil War period, and all that has gone on in between two World Wars, depressions, and recessions, it's highly unlikely that they are going to be folding their doors within the immediate future. That's a pretty good bet. In other words there's a need. There is a need and there are resources that are not necessarily measured in dollars and cents. There are physical plants. There are commitments from the faculties, and in some instances church denominations that support some of these schools, and there is a richness there in the midst of physical poverty you might say. Now, we had one school that was in severe financial circumstances and when it appeared that it might have to close its doors, it was able to raise a million and a half dollars in three months to keep its doors open. The money that we are raising is primarily needed to assure a high level of academic achievement in these institutions. When a school has to cut its budget 15 or 20 percent, it doesn't close its doors. It cuts off the number of options that the students have in the selection of courses. It may cut out an area of study; the curriculum is less rich, but the school itself does not fold up in the sense of closing, and we shudder at all of the speculation about the possibility of Black colleges closing. I'm very close to the scene and I can say to you very candidly that there is no possibility of this.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:12:37.940
Now there is this issue that you're speaking of, I would imagine essentially with the private Black college. However with the public Black college, predominantly Black college, with the civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Act, with the EEOC activity in terms of integration etc., I know that there have been several meetings and conferences held about how do you really deal with that. For example, in some states there are some relatively (even though they are large in comparison to the private Black college), relatively small public institutions that have 99 percent Black students or ninety nine point nine percent Black students, sometimes right in the same town with a predominantly white-supported institution and suggestion that they be merged. The great resistance on the part of the Black community because of the heritage and tradition of the school. Also because when they're married, frequently the leadership moves from Black hands to white hands, that the number of faculty positions diminishes considerably. So that there is an issue there that in some way, those of us in the Black community and education community are going to have to deal with in relationship to the public Black institutions. On the other hand, as you point out in relationship to the private Black institutions, the fact that they meet a need and the fact that they have this long tradition and this reservoir of energy which enables them to meet the crisis, tends to suggest that they will survive. On the other hand, there is this problem about this gap: the haves and the have nots. Education is a tough proposition. Takes more money to produce the same quality a person today than it did 10 years ago.

Christopher Edley 00:14:27.412
Right. But before you, before we get to that point, let's get back to the public institutions where there are traditionally Black colleges on one side of the town and there is a publicly supported predominantly white institution on the other side of town. The pressures to force the integration there are pressures that are coming essentially from the white side and from AGW. If you consider for a moment that at none of our Black colleges, private or public, have we ever discriminated against the admission of white students, and most of our student bodies have been integrated from the very beginning going back over a hundred years. Then why have they remained segregated? And this is a matter of choice. They are not segregated in the sense of having a predominantly Black student body because they are in, say the Black part of the community, because many of them are not, many are in the outlying areas, and many of them draw their student bodies from the entire United States. So there is a self-selection process that has resulted in Black students going to Black colleges to the point of making up ninety nine percent of the enrollment in some of the public colleges, and white students electing to apply to a historically, predominantly white institution. If one could theorize that the students might reverse that, if next year, all of the white students applied to the Black school and all of the Blacks to the white school, the complexions of those schools would be changed overnight, and there's nothing to prevent that. There are no barriers.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:16:13.300
Matter of fact there are at least two examples of that: West Virginia State College.

Christopher Edley 00:16:17.670
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:16:18.150
And Institute, which at one time was 95 percent black is now about 70 percent white, and I believe at Lincoln University in Missouri, they are moving up to a 50 50 or 60 40 ratio between whites and Blacks

Christopher Edley 00:16:29.551
And in some of our institutions, the white enrollment is four, five, six percent. In some of the areas like the School of Veterinary Medicine/veterinarian medicine at Tuskegee, the student body is at least 50 percent white. At the School of Social Work at Atlanta University, there has always been a large number of white students there, and these trends will continue. The, as you know, at the two predominantly Black medical schools, there are are as many white applicants as there are Black applicants applying for the spaces. So an integration is achieved in these settings simply because the white students elect to apply to predominantly Black schools. So I think that there's very little that the government can do to prevent students from electing to go to the school of their choice. There is freedom of choice that operates at the level of higher education. There are no mandatory laws that compel a student even to go to college. It's optional on his part. I think that we have to bear that in mind. Also I think in this connection that we have to bear in mind, that some of the great institutions of this country are ethnically identified. Just to mention two: Brandeis University and Notre Dame. I don't know what it is that might urge a Jewish kid to apply to Brandeis, or a Catholic kid to go to Notre Dame. I know that a lot of Protestants go to both schools, that there are no barriers that are erected for people from other ethnic groups. And I don't think we should be so surprised when a Black kid at age 18 coming out of high school decides for whatever subjective reasons there may be, that he would like to attend a predominantly Black institution. And tied in with that is the demonstrated fact that our schools have been highly successful in preparing Blacks to live in an integrated society, and to prepare and to provide leadership for an integrated society.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:18:47.890
'Course there is one thing that we tend to overlook and that is that most of these Black state-supported schools were maintained as separate institutions to keep the Blacks from going to the white universities. And now that the things have turned around, and Blacks can go to white universities, and the basketball team at University of Alabama for example is all Black, and 10 percent of the football team is Black, and Louisiana State, and Mississippi has a Black quarterback and so on. There is a sort of competition for both the more able Black student athletically, and the more able Black student academically.

Christopher Edley 00:19:27.211
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:19:27.631
And one of the allegations, and it's a, in a sense, a logical consequence of the segregation, is that the Black institutions, because of the segregation and the limited resources, tended to have lower quality programs in certain areas. Now you pointed up in certain other areas, like the School of Veterinary Science at Tuskegee and School of Social Work Atlanta, the reputation is such that they're better than the average white counterpart. But as we begin to get into this balance of trade (and I use that term in terms of who goes where and who selects what), you're finding that Black students, just like white students, are going to opt for institutions for a variety of reasons. Some of them based on the quality of the academic program, some of them based on the quality of athletic programs, some of them based on the quality of a social life. And I think with higher education becoming such a valuable and important commodity in our society, more and more, there is going to be this competition for quality, which then gets into the question is, how can or how does the predominantly Black institution, public or private, maintain the quality that's going to attract a whole range of students? So that, as I've heard it said, the Black institution doesn't always get just a mass of students who have academic problems. Not as I mentioned earlier, that these students don't have the intellectual potential, because personally I believe that everyone has intellectual potential. The question is what kind of backgrounds have they had. And if one particular type of institution tends to get a larger proportion of students who have limited academic backgrounds, that does raise some questions or give institutions some problems in terms of how to function. First of all it takes more money to bring students who have academic problems into the academic mainstream, and the other is the question of the mix of the institution.

Christopher Edley 00:21:27.990
Yes, but I think that you may have overstated that. You have to realize that, and I'm sure you do, that our institutions started out as colleges at a time when 98 percent of the Blacks in this country were illiterate. And college was at best a euphemism. We had to teach them first elementary school, and then those who finish elementary school became the teachers, and eventually we moved up to the point where the elementary and secondary departments were cut out, and we were left with only the college level instruction going on.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:01.141
And that's a pattern that many of the Black colleges went through, particularly many of those that were developed through churches.

Christopher Edley 00:22:06.783
Unquestionably. And many of the white colleges went through the same pattern back in the late 1700s and early eighteen hundreds. We were just later getting in the game because of slavery. The, but the college has an obligation to provide an education to the students who come. We have in many of our institutions had something very close to open admissions for the better part of a century. And the only limitation on the open admission for the students who had some showing that they could do college level work, was the amount of scholarship available to maintain the students. In many of our institutions, some 94, 95 percent of the students are receiving some type of financial aid. And the average is extremely high as compared with white students. Now, it is in that setting of providing an education for the students, and meeting the students wherever they are. One of our distinguished professors who's done a study of eleven Black colleges, Dan Thompson, points out that instruction in the Black colleges differs from the white schools in this sense: that in the English course, the teacher does not assume that the student has mastered English or that the student has mastered history through high school. They know for a fact that many other Blacks are coming from ghetto areas, and from third and fourth rate high school systems, and they simply can't afford to make that assumption, which is taken for granted at many of the top level predominantly white institutions and that's one reason why our students, our Black students, have such a high attrition rate at many of the predominantly white schools. The, on the Black campus, the teacher starts at the beginning, and very quickly brings the entire class up to the level where it is ready to start as a group in college level English courses, history courses, science courses, and what have you. This is remedial education that exists for those Black students who need it going into our institutions. And there's a great deal of cultural enrichment that is involved in the process as you well know as a teacher. Now to look at those students and to say that because the student who may have been the valedictorian of his class in a very small community in Mississippi, and he goes to a Black college, and he is not of the same academic level at entering college that, say a freshman is at Harvard, is not to say that that student is inferior or cannot achieve. And the fact that our students go on to college in four years, and in some instances five years, get their bachelor's degree and a high percentage of them, over 25 percent of them, go on to the best graduate schools in this country, means that we are achieving something. I think that the graduates of the Black colleges have to be measured in terms of the product turned out rather than the caliber of the student who is admitted.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:25:24.780
Yeah ,really essential that's what I was suggesting earlier, because basically I think most people in education believe everyone has the potential to learn and to benefit from higher education, unless there's some medical problems or what have you.

Christopher Edley 00:25:37.991
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:25:38.381
The question is how do you do it? And I think the issue that you face through the Fund, through many of the private colleges as well as the public colleges, is the cost of doing this, because you talk about teachers, professors who take students where they are and use a variety of ways of reaching them. These are creative people, and to hold these people on your faculty, and to get significant numbers of them, takes money. It's true enough, professors at these institutions hopefully are committed. Not all of them are Black. I think in most institutions, only about 60 or 70 percent of our faculty are Black, which means that you really have to get into the academic marketplace and be able to purchase good professors, purchase the type of equipment, develop the type of libraries, which really puts you right to the gun in terms of producing the money for these institutions to survive. And it does raise a question which you asked earlier, and that is the responsibility of the Black community itself to support these institutions. Much of, many of the predominately Black institutions have been supported by rich white families and corporations, etc. What can be done to get the Black community itself to support these institutions better?

Christopher Edley 00:26:55.870
Well I personally feel that it comes down to a matter of publicly accepting a responsibility. I know that there are many middle class Blacks who are not contributing to the United Negro College Fund, and whatever the reason is for not supporting us, what is the reason for not supporting NAACP or the National Urban League? They are simply cop-outs and I think that we have to have a higher level of accountability. There are some ethnic groups in this country, as you know, who do hold members of their group to a higher level of accountability. And I think the solution has to lie in that direction. I think that a Black of means, who's earning good money has a responsibility to stand up publicly and be counted in terms of contributing to Black causes.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:27:42.011
And I think that's one of the things that we hope will happen as a result of this program. Let's say Blacks in the New York area and throughout the country will support the United Negro College Fund and help to support these Black institutions which are essential to the development of Black people in America.

Christopher Edley 00:27:56.261
And that whites will continue to do so also.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:27:58.183
Right on. I'd like to thank our guest Christopher Edley of the United Negro College Fund for talking with us about the objectives of the fund for 1975. Thank you Chris.

Christopher Edley 00:28:07.831
Thank you.
