Speaker 1 00:00:01.580
58 percent of black medical students in the nation are receiving some support from the national medical fellowships Inc On November 7th The NSF will sponsor a fundraising event at the Westchester premiere theater in Tarrytown Here Dr. Benny J Prim Clementine butts and Marian bond are on discuss the work of the NSF on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:46.450
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:10.810
With us this evening Dr. Benny prim Clementine butts and Marion bond right And we're going to be talking about the national medical fellowships Incorporated which as we said at the top this show has a tremendous role in supporting black medical students to help fill the gap this need that we have for more black physicians So Benny possibly you could begin the program by talking about the national medical fellowship Tell us what it is and what you're trying to do

Speaker 4 00:01:37.480
Well this organization was called was founded in 1946 as the Providence Medical associate by Dr. Franklin C. McClean He was a pioneer in medical education for black Americans educational purpose was to assist black physicians seeking specialty training that is after their medical school completion that would go on and become specialists and obstetricians and gynecologists or etc. In 1962 the prominent medical associate then was renamed the national medical fellowships Inc And it's now has that present name In 1970 it began to include other minority groups underrepresented in medicine i.e. for Mexican Americans mainland Puerto Ricans and certainly Native Americans or American Indians And from that point it has been working to assist them throughout the United States to get into medical schools to assist them financially to complete their medical school education

Speaker 3 00:02:40.850
Now they've been a number of extremely illustrious black physicians who have received assistance from the IMF and Marian You work with the national medical fellowships as an assistant director of development Could you tell us the names of some of these really eminent people who did get some support from an AMA

Speaker 5 00:03:01.540
Well some of the more prominent ones I can list are June Christmas She's head of the New York City Department of Mental Health and Retardation There's Leslie Alexander who's chief of radiology new off shore hospital Cubas who's director from the state hospital We have also Edith Reed who's Medical Director of Carter community health clinic and Elizabeth Davis is director of psychiatry at Harlem Hospital The six that I just named will be honored at our benefit on the 7th We will be highlighting the while will prominent physicians will be highlighted at the benefit And those six will be giving honorary plaques now as director development

Speaker 3 00:03:45.490
You have an assistant director of when you have a lot to do with raising funds What about the financial base of this organization Obviously in addition to doing education and helping to get people into medical school they provide financial support in order to provide financial support you have to have money So what is your financial base basically

Speaker 5 00:04:03.960
Well the base festival most of the funds come from foundations We get about 55 percent of our funding from foundations and about 45 from corporations and the funds are raised through local committees that we have set up across the country We have standing committees in Boston Cleveland Minneapolis Detroit And when I say committee I mean a group of volunteers mostly physicians and businessmen who really beat the bushes for us so to speak and raise funds to help students nationally or in their respective areas

Speaker 3 00:04:40.330
Now on November 7 the West Chester premiere theatre is going to be a fundraising event And Dr. Benny Prem was with us tonight And Ms Clementine butts are the co-chair persons So Clementine could you tell us something about this affair Well Who's gonna be there How one can get tickets for it and just watch your activities are in this regard

Speaker 6 00:05:06.370
Yes I'd be glad to On Sunday afternoon November 7 1976 the national medical fellowship will celebrate its 30th anniversary by sponsoring at the 8th party at the West Chester premiere at the hour in Tarrytown New York This is a special matinee performance and it will be given at 3 p.m. on that Sunday vitriol Ella Fitzgerald Count Basie are Oscar Peterson and Joe Pass

Speaker 7 00:05:36.400
This benefit is one of the other fund raising efforts that we hope will become an annual affair for national medical fellowships and is also a vehicle for really further highlighting the national medical fellowships efforts

Speaker 6 00:05:56.730
If you if one is interested in tickets they could contact should contact the national medical fellowships office directly by telephoning us at 2 4 6 4 5 2 9

Speaker 3 00:06:09.600
That's area code 2 4 6 4 5 2 9 national medical fellowships and that's to request information about area code is 2 1 2

Speaker 1 00:06:17.130
Did I say 2 1 2 you said 2 4 6 I'm sorry about that OK It's very important when we get these area codes and get them OK Well it is the New York City office of the national medical fellowship which is located in terms of the actual address It's located at 250 West 57 between Broadway and 8th And I see now Benny let's get back to the original purpose of this organization Provide support motivation admissions counseling and financial assistance to get blacks and other minorities into the field of medicine QUESTION And many times listeners I ask and people ask me is why do we need a special effort to get blacks into medicine Aren't there enough doctors can't white doctors treat black people just as well What about this What is your focus and why is it so important

Speaker 8 00:07:11.580
Well I could talk from many points of view on that and probably all day as you very well know many I know you're a long time

Speaker 9 00:07:24.660
The reason though is that culturally I think it's very difficult for us to expect despite our assimilation within the American society that a white physician can truly understand thoroughly our basic problems and backgrounds A significant thing in that area which I think will highlight it very much is let's take our elderly who have traditionally taken their own medications for numbers and numbers of years when there were no physicians available whatsoever in rural areas and none of these were home remedies that that whites have literally heard nothing about For example policies and sassafras tea and many other things that I could name here Now the black physician who is trained and who has some Semblance of his cultural background residuals he can indeed relate to a problem of a person like that There are many other problems sickle cell anemia diet for example which can be barely understood by a black physician is not always understood and learned by many white physicians And I think they have an edge in terms of treatment Not only that I think that in a population such as we have professionally we should be represented in a percentage amount equal to the percentage amount that we make up the total population

Speaker 10 00:08:52.710
In fact I think the percentage of black physicians are my two or three percent of the total number of physicians that but in actuality Roscoe out of 300 thousand physicians in this country there are about 70 400 black physicians And that's about a four point two five seven percentage and very very small percentage

Speaker 1 00:09:12.470
When we make up 22 percent of the total population of this country and of course one of the reasons why blacks have not gotten into medicine is the poor education that many blacks receive in high school because of the racist system of segregated schools and the other of course is the financial situation Exactly

Speaker 11 00:09:33.630
And of course that's one of the things that NSF tries to really deal with unquestionably medical schools in this country cost anywhere from two thousand thirty dollars and ten cents at Howard to some ten thousand dollars at one other major university in the nation And it requires at least seven thousand dollars per year for a medical student to stay in school That is with room and board and tuition And it's it's very difficult for any family much less black families who are low on the socioeconomic level to provide that kind of support for a medical school education I'd like to make one more statement out of the total enrollment in this country of medical students that which is presently under the 75 76 year fifty five thousand eight hundred eighteen students

Speaker 9 00:10:24.990
That's including whites blacks Mexican Americans American Indians and Puerto Ricans There are only three thousand four hundred and fifty six black students or six point two percent of that number which will far below the level that we ought to be and wanted to bring up the number of physicians to be equal to the percentage of the that we represent have to literally triple the number of black doctors for a long period of time

Speaker 1 00:10:48.690
Actually it a thrust that along the lines of women as matter of fact women have progressed much more rapidly so than some entering medical schools now something mentoring classes in medical school something in the order of 30 35 percent of entering class women which is something that should be done But the point is that minorities blacks in particular need to be represented more Now Clementine as we were talking about your fundraising event you're a volunteer You're helping out to get this event off the ground What is your motivation for this other than the fact that your husband is the thing think Dr. Hugh butts and you sort of logical and obvious vested interests but specifically what are people like yourself do to get into this And what do you hope to accomplish as a result of this activity

Speaker 6 00:11:34.770
Well I think Betty has talked quite eloquently in terms of the need of black physicians in this country

Speaker 7 00:11:44.430
And I had a personal experience quite recently when a woman had her young son to come from a southern state because this young man cannot get medical attention There was not a doctor in And Miles needless to say he on the way up by bus had passed out in a station bus station in Atlanta Georgia and the poor man

Speaker 12 00:12:14.820
By the time he reached here he was near death But the fact is that this man had to travel in this ill condition set condition to try and come to get medical care Now medical care in New York has its problems However when you think of it on a national scale can you imagine where there are places where there aren't doctors for hundreds of miles and particularly where they're not black and whether in areas that are predominantly black Exactly So my motivation while it is or has it's personal is certainly has I hope a much more altruistic race

Speaker 8 00:12:52.900
I'm sure it does

Speaker 3 00:12:54.010
Now Marion could you tell us what the average grant is from the fellowships because Benny talks about the cost and seventy thousand dollars a year to go to medical school What is your average grant

Speaker 13 00:13:05.070
Well the average grant last year that see 75 76 school year was 12 23 We really Well first of all the grants range from about eight hundred twenty five hundred and they're based on a student's needs What we try to do is provide one third of what the student requires for one year of medical school

Speaker 1 00:13:24.820
And I think that is really a relatively small amount in relationship to the overall purpose and many What are some of the other things that you folks in the medical profession are doing to try to get more support for black medical students

Speaker 11 00:13:37.230
Well we certainly personally make no significant contributions to scholarships and to places like the national medical fellowships We encourage high school students to begin very early on in our direction to go to medical school and to try to save

Speaker 3 00:13:55.890
We're talking this evening with Dr. Benny prim Ms Clementine butts and Miss Marian Van Doren of the national medical fellowships

Speaker 1 00:14:02.970
And we're really dealing with a very important issue for society that is that black people are really not adequately served medically in any way Certainly they're not served adequately in terms of the number of black physicians And of course the ratio of black physicians to the black community in general whether it's white or black is very very low And one of the things I'd like you to address yourself to Bernie is really why is this other than the general syndrome of racism which premieres everything and affects black but in particular in medicine and things to be very very bad Why do you think this exists and what can be done about it in a sense

Speaker 14 00:14:44.670
Probably the most lucrative and the last bastion of individual entrepreneurship in this nation is that of the practice of medicine on an individual basis as the only place where a man can actually sit down in his office and negotiate with the patient how much it would cost to take on a thyroid etc. etc. I prefaced what I had to say with that remark to let you know that medicine has been a fraternity It has been one that has been all exclusive of any group any group other than those that work on the controlling interests and that controlling interest has always been by the white Anglo-Saxon partisan Americans As you know many minorities have started medical schools in order to break through that market The Catholic started their Catholic schools the Jews have started sort of primarily Jewish schools Blacks have had to institutions throughout the nation that the to for all of our people but not enough at all to do any good in terms of breaking that fraternity It's a racist profession has notoriously been controlled by the American Medical Association and up until about 1961 62 It was impossible for a black physician even to get into the ACMA First you had to belong to his county medical society of which he was excluded to join the ACMA And then he had to be a member of this society in order to practice into a hospital He ofttimes lost his patients when they were ready to go to the hospital because he had to seek out a white physician to take care of that patient when he was hospitalized So it's been racist continues to be racist And the numbers are reduced because of the entrepreneurial kind of system that is perpetuated by the medical societies and associations of these United States of course as I said on sole reason

Speaker 1 00:16:41.030
And I interview black leaders from every profession from law from engineering from dentistry from medicine from education I hear almost the same words because the percentage is actually in law even less Something like one percent or one point two percent of lawyers are black in the field of dentistry It's less than 2 percent I feel if engineering is like point six percent so that what you're really describing is a generic syndrome that affects blacks in professional areas partially as we said earlier because of the education that is required for entry to the fields but more specifically because of just the general societal racism that first depresses education and the public schools and they related private schools and then has its impact on the colleges then behind that then you have the financial situation for example pointed out earlier that the national medical fellowship provides about a third of the support for some 58 percent of black medical students in medical school That means there's two thirds to come by whereas other two thirds come by I understand I believe Marin you said that some of the medical schools do give a another third

Speaker 5 00:17:54.890
Yes that's correct Most the students that we assess come from families with average incomes of under ten thousand dollars therefore they're eligible for some sort of financial support from the medical school So the student really makes up pass a package of third from M.S. And then he gets one third of his tuition from the medical school

Speaker 1 00:18:14.390
But then on the other hand you air for the rest of the ride or he has to take out a loan I see now hopefully through the activities of organizations like an IMF first will get an increased awareness of the need for black physicians We'll get an increased awareness of the need for more financial support and through the leadership of people like Clementine but we'll get more citizen participation help raise money Now talking about raising money this way these fundraising events are very high visibility Ella Fitzgerald great person you know Count Basie won't be there himself because he's recuperating at least I understand he is we sail in the Bahamas someone But we expect him to make an appearance so he'll be there may not play right but he'll be quite a gentleman and Oscar Peterson and Joe Pass they will be performing But how do you as a citizen leader Clementine see what you're doing in terms of raising fund you raise some money from it but in terms of letting the world know about this very peculiar and particular important problem that blacks have How does a fundraising event like this fit into it

Speaker 15 00:19:21.110
Well one one way in which it does I think it's it's reflected just by being here today for example of the fact that we are having a fundraising affair on November 7 provided us with an opportunity to use this affair as a vehicle through which we could really express a much more basic and urgent cry And that is the need to help black young candidates for medical school young people who not only are in medical schools but young people who would like to dream about I have a dream to go to medical school and through this venture on the 7th we hope that we will have nearly 3000 people we will have three thousand people seated and at that moment we can educate just a wee bit We hope 3000 people many of whom are not that familiar with national matter medical fellowships and through other resources media resources we can use this as a way if people help this general and right behind that would send that national medical fellowship then you know maybe this is a way that we have to unfortunately sometimes have people hear us to tie it in with with the greats And this is what we hope to accomplish On Sunday November a little bit more of educating people about our cause and then of course you will be educating some of it not educating because you'll be doing that too

Speaker 1 00:20:53.640
You'll be honoring some of your distinguished alumni as it were people who received support themselves when they are in medical school Benny do you think that black physicians get the credit the public credit that they deserve I know for example in your case you're an outstanding person in a field of drug addiction control and helping people to come back from this abyss that they fall into And you're well known throughout the nation for this But in general do you think black physicians get enough credit for what they do

Speaker 16 00:21:28.910
Not at all I think when you look at all the difficulty that black physicians have had to overcome to become a physician it means that he had to have a certain kind of perseverance and everything else that within him to within her to do so and to Not receive the kind of accolades it's rather discouraging in many instances you know when there had so few black physicians who still have so few Lots of people still believe that only the white physician is the one to go to Even among our own people I think that we are now dispelling that myth because of the the national medical fellowships because of some of the great people that that we have produced in black medicine But it's just now becoming well known and I think that that was this kind of effort It can change

Speaker 1 00:22:30.860
And of course there are some black physicians who are in key leadership roles in a New York City area Dr. John Ellis Holliman Mike Holman and Dr. June Christmas Dr. Hollerin heads of Health and Hospitals Corporation he's been on our show and talked about some of the problems that he has The city has the providing health care And Dr. and Christmas with the Mental Hygiene division a mental health division of the city of New York And there are some visibility because of their public position But as you suggest the average practitioner in the trenches the average researcher doesn't get the publicity And even when they do have positions of visibility sometimes their racial identification with the particular concern is not noted For example Dr. Hugh Busby has been involved in some really significant problems at Bronx State Hospital And yet as you read this not that they should see a doctor but black physician There doesn't seem to be any awareness unless there just happens to be a picture that here's a man who is dealing with problems that really face black people and has a particular sensitivity to them not that white physicians can have sensitivity that's not the point The point is that some of the problems as you point out earlier Bernie are so indigenous to the black experience not the mental health problem necessarily indigenous but with the pressures that black people face In a sense proportionately they have more of certain kinds of problems Marion could we go back a little bit to some of your support What are some of the foundations et cetera that support national medical fellowship

Speaker 5 00:24:15.110
Well some of the foundations and supporters from Sloan Foundation is one of the Irvine Foundation in California and Commonwealth Foundation And while those are some of the more important ones we also get a lot of support from some of the major corporations you might be interested in knowing some of them Exxon for example gives their support equitable life insurance company Prudential

Speaker 8 00:24:42.890
We seem to get a lot of support from corporations where there's a vested interest in health care and that's one of the problems in other words the oil industry pollutes the air ways that could not be hard to live and where and certainly they have a vested interest in their health care Well I'm sure you do I was just

Speaker 1 00:25:02.540
Yes know you're just buddies but the point is very very true that in all of these areas where blacks are underrepresented it is to the benefit of the white society just to support the training and development of more black professionals and that is the key point that I think black leaders like yourselves continue to emphasize

Speaker 15 00:25:23.840
Also I want to speak to many may be able to certainly highlight this even better than I you know the future We have those that are there just seemed to kind of get beaten down or if you will kill us or for just by working just twenty eight hours a day So I think just no more people to in order to say that the work could be shared more with people like Dr. Prem who you know has to put in my notes how many I really like the wave of diseases

Speaker 1 00:25:56.930
But let me ask you another question which goes beyond your role being relate to your husband and that is the role of private citizens like yourself in raising funds for significant black causes I think it's laudable that you take the time and energy to do this Are there more people like yourselves who are not physicians who are involved in this effort

Speaker 6 00:26:18.350
Yes in fact I Marian can certainly also speak to this point I think we think in terms of our committee we'll have a committee meeting tomorrow evening

Speaker 7 00:26:30.680
We've been able to call on people who have who will just come in and work for several hours in the evening to try and put this benefit together for us We have a lengthy support list of people who will sell tickets for us

Speaker 8 00:26:45.980
And you really shouldn't have any names because if you mentioned one we have a list of 200

Speaker 1 00:26:51.810
If you mentioned one I think you would be really doing a disservice I think the point you have developed is very very good that there is a large citizen support for this and it is important as you suggest for people in the black community support not only the national medical fellowship but some of the other activities and organizations that are devoted toward improving the conditions of black people

Speaker 10 00:27:13.340
I think we should mention here too that any contributions to the national medical fellowship are certainly tax deductible and the tickets are indeed tax deductible and the price of a ticket yeah

Speaker 1 00:27:24.820
You can give it the price of the tickets

Speaker 12 00:27:26.180
The price of the tickets are 25 dollars for orchestra and twenty dollars for mezzanine

Speaker 3 00:27:31.970
Hopefully with a big chunk of that going to national medical fellowship after expenses for those interested in obtaining tickets for the benefit for national medical fellowship should contact the NAMM effort very close 2 1 2 2 4 6 4 5 2 9 0 get done tonight on so sole reason have been Dr. Benny J Prem and Ms Clementine Butts who are chairpersons of the benefit for the national medical fellowships to be held on November 7th at the Westchester premiere theatre and Marian bond Wright who is assistant director of development for the national medical fellowships Inc We've been discussing the important problem of providing support to train additional black physicians to meet the need for physicians and to improve the quality of health care in the black community
