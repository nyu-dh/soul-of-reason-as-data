Speaker 1 00:00:01.560
In the 1972 presidential election black voters accounted for 25 percent of the Democratic candidates vote in 1976 Black voters will again hold the key to the presidency here David Dinkins chairman of the black elected officials of New York State discussed the black vote on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:48.060
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:09.480
With us this evening on soul of reason is David Dinkins who is chairman of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State and is very active in practically everything involving black politics not only in New York but also in the nation Glad to have you with us tonight Dave Thank you Happy to be here Roscoe Well one of the things is very important is that as we address black audiences and white audiences as well is that they really understand the nature of the black vote what voters respond to what black voters are concerned about and what black elected officials are doing to get more black voters out and to influence the course of politics So let's begin the show tonight

Speaker 4 00:01:51.240
Dave maybe you could address some of the issues that you think candidates must deal with if they're going to get the black vote in fall's election

Speaker 5 00:02:01.020
OK I can enumerate for you about a dozen issue areas but before I do I think it would be helpful to to say to our audience that with which I'm sure you're familiar and that's the conference that was held in Charlotte North Carolina this year conference of the caucus of black Democrats which is headed by Basil Paterson who's also the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee And this this conference was held to not select a presidential candidate and a Democratic nominee for the presidency but rather just to address some dozen issue areas And thanks to some very fine excellent staff work done largely by Barbara Williams who is the or headed at least by Barbara Williams who is the executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus and Frank Cowan who is the director of the Office of Minority Affairs the Democratic National Committee and many many other very fine dedicated people those of us who arrived at Charlotte had products that were points of departure for us to discuss these areas which are list in just a moment and I'd be said that the president in this conference were black elected officials and party officials and civic leaders and labor people and clergy and educators from across the nation and it was a heartwarming to see what tremendous talent we had and the ability we had to come together for this kind of purpose when we go on day one thing

Speaker 3 00:03:38.910
I think it's important to point up is that when you talk about black elected officials in this country unfortunately or maybe fortunately most of the time you're talking about black Democrats because that's true 85 90 percent of blacks registered Democratic and those who vote to have a vote almost in the same proportion Democratic So that it isn't necessarily a partisan issue it's just that rather than time the Democrats seem to have been the group that black people have been attracted to just as at the turn of the century they were attracted to the Republican Party growing out of the work in reconstruction and post reconstruction

Speaker 6 00:04:16.829.9999999999709
I agree your point well taken and our statistics from the Joint Center and other Joint Center for Political Studies in Washington and other sources we claim that that blacks vote something in the neighborhood of 90 percent or more democratic that is 90 percent or more of those blacks who vote vote the Democratic line

Speaker 3 00:04:36.300
Another issue which had some future program probably we talked with and another black elected official from the Republican side is that maybe there ought to be more black people in the Republican Party because this does tend to limit the mobility and even the pressure that blacks can bring on the Democratic Party unless they just rely on their numbers

Speaker 5 00:04:56.820
I can't quarrel with that but to digress a moment from from where we are in enumerating these issue areas which we will not forget to do

Speaker 6 00:05:06.480
It is true that there is a value in the two party system as it relates to blacks and to the populace generally But I think that the black Democrats have found a way even in the absence of two party pressure or pressure from the other party so to speak to to be effective even though our numbers be small For instance the Congressional Black Caucus has compiled statistics that show that they are marginal areas across the nation where in whites who have been elected to Congress in November in a two party in a two person contest have emerged victorious by a margin of 8 percent or 7 percent or 12 percent and the percentage of blacks voting in that congressional district exceeds the margin so that when Charlie Rangel and Yvonne Burke and Shirley Chisholm and others and whites For that matter white liberals in the Congress go to those persons and suggest to them that perhaps their black constituency is unaware of the position they've taken on a given piece of legislation And perhaps they'd like to reconsider their position I think that the appropriate properly used with the in selecting the spots when to use it that we can be effective in that sense even the absence of a an effective two party system which is not an argument against a two party system by any means

Speaker 4 00:06:33.850
And of course this is something it's a recent development because for years blacks had two congresspeople someone from Illinois Dawson died in Illinois and the great Adam Clayton Powell Junior And it was only beginning somewhere in the late 50s mid 50s that we began to pick up a few with Charlie Diggs from Michigan and finally now the caucus number some 16 people plus Walter Fauntroy from Washington

Speaker 3 00:07:00.310
And that does suggest that this change but of course it's a minuscule change and many people have criticized black participation in organized politics Didn't make a difference And guess what you're saying is it Yes it does make a difference particularly if the black elected officials use their clout in those border areas to begin to mobilize coalitions which will enable certain issues that blacks are concerned about to be moving in a positive direction

Speaker 6 00:07:25.180
That's exactly the point I would wish to make You know as rather example that is frequently cited and I try to state it very briefly but remind us all that back in 1965 here in the state of New York there was inability to elect a speaker of the assembly because they were divided the forces democratic forces were divided between Anthony trivia and Stanley Stein got and Wagner was then the mayor of the city of New York who supported trivia and after 30 days the state's business standing still the Republican governor rockefeller threw support to trivia and he became the speaker

Speaker 5 00:08:01.510
But the Democrats were tremendously embarrassed by this So that in the succeeding year 1966 in our state legislature the Democrats again had a majority we were privileged to have there Then Percy Sutton and Basil Paterson and Shirley Chisholm and a whole lot of shots fired at national politics

Speaker 6 00:08:18.550
And then I was in that number and we went into trivia and made the point to him that although the Democrats were in the majority if you deducted from their number which in that particular year was 90 the number of their number that were black they then would have a number that was less than one half of the total body which in that year was a hundred and sixty five In other words without the blacks they didn't have a majority And we effectively use that got some things which when we look back now were a pittance but were tremendously symbolic then But more importantly they taught us a lesson we learned what power we had which I think we have to some degree USED EFFECTIVELY SINCE

Speaker 3 00:08:57.790
Right now what are some of those issues that we want to address that power to

Speaker 5 00:09:00.790
Well the the issues that we addressed in Charlotte and which were subsequently largely adopted by the Democratic Platform Committee thanks to Yvonne Burke who is a member of Congress from California and also she is a chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus They were full employment And then the whole problem of the urban problems of the cities the Voter Participation health care crime education civil rights welfare reform tax reform Africa and incidentally talked about energy which is not an area that we would normally get in

Speaker 1 00:09:41.590
But we find out that black people are going to be ones to suffer most when the energy crunch comes right And they even came up in this platform with the idea of energy stamps right Which is now being considered very very seriously by the people in the conservation well going out of this as you said the Democratic platform pretty much adopted most of these practically all of these recommendations and you know they nominated Jimmy Carter as a candidate A lot of black involvement Basil Paterson was very active in his role as vice chairman Democratic National Committee Barbara Jordan gave a stirring speech And Young was very influential in terms of the Carter nomination What do you think's going to happen What do you think How do you think the black voting populace is going to respond to the Jimmy Carter candidacy will they come out to vote

Speaker 7 00:10:31.750
Well I think that they will I think it's the job of the black professional politician to try to see to it that they do which means it to me that we must persuade the black populace that it does make a difference And I think that we do this by not not simply pointing out the obvious

Speaker 6 00:10:56.080
With respect to Ford and Reagan and the eight years of them that we have had and what terrible folks they are in my mind Any reference that I make to Ford is he's a guy who part Nixon and I don't feel that that we need to elaborate on who Nixon is It would seem to me that that alone is a sufficient reason but I think that we need to offer more I think that we need to persuade the black electorate that if you would demand a piece of the pie then you must participate at the polls And I think that the Carter recognizes the need for him not only to win but to win big because to be elected is one thing to govern is quite another And I think that if we are as large a part of his victory as we can be given our numbers if we in fact register and vote which is a whole nother area of discussion I think that that we can be a tremendously significant portion of his victory Our statistics claim that in the 1972 presidential election twenty five point six or so twenty five point six percent of the total Democratic vote was black Now if these figures are inflated a bit if instead of twenty five point six it's only 25 or 20 That's still one in four to five votes That's black Now that's pretty heavy

Speaker 3 00:12:16.660
And even though they lost the Democrats lost in 72 if the same situation occurs in 76 they will also lose value Amy that if they don't get enough people out it will affect them negatively Now let's talk about very briefly Voter registration you were formerly head of the Board of Elections here in New York City etc. What can we do to get more black and Puerto Rican people to register to vote

Speaker 6 00:12:41.080
Well I think that we need a lot more discussion of the type that I'm grateful that you and I are having right now because it tends to make the point that it does make a difference that participation is important We need to do away with the apathetic attitude It doesn't make any difference they're all a bunch of crooks anyway and all of that I think we need to persuade our black electorate that there is a piece of pie to be divided and if we don't participate that those others will go off and gleefully cut up that pie without it and wouldn't give less than a darn We have not chosen to involve ourselves so that it does make a difference I think that the time will come in the not too distant future when three people are standing on a corner and a fourth joins them and they ask that forth whether or not he is registered if he is not in fact registered he will lie and say he is and rush off to register because it will become unpopular not to be registered to vote And that's the climate we must create right now

Speaker 4 00:13:42.730
Where does a person go to register to vote in New York City area

Speaker 6 00:13:46.270
Well you of course can go to any one of the five offices of the board of elections but there are a whole host of civic and community and political organizations that are employing the mail registration system that we now have so that you can fill out a relatively simple form and bring it or mail it to the Board of Elections or leave it with that organization which will deliver it for you

Speaker 8 00:14:06.040
We're talking this evening with David Dinkins who is chairman of the Council of Black Elected Democrats in New York State

Speaker 4 00:14:12.400
And as we were talking about the alienation of some black voters from the so-called democratic process and maybe that fell into the same trap because I say so-called democratic process democratic with a small D

Speaker 8 00:14:25.990
One of the concerns has been the concern of black youth and other minority youth They really have tended to stay away I was reading some statistics the other day that showed that only 20 percent of total voters between the age of 18 and 20 voted in the 1974 election And among black youth who was far less And among those between 20 and 27 only about 30 some odd percent voted which tends to suggest a general alienate of youth from the voting process And as we say black youth and other minority youth it's even more alienation

Speaker 4 00:15:04.390
They suggest that even though you run down a housing program or whatever some of the things were in the platform what you asked for is too little too late Instead of asking for 100 million dollar housing program we might be asking for a billion dollar program that people like yourself and other elected officials should be opting to cut the defense budget and put more into domestic budgets And since you don't do that or haven't been successful in doing that they are saying look why should we get involved in electoral process So now when I asked you David Dinkins why should black youth get involved in the electoral process and how can they Well I think that the the there is an obligation

Speaker 7 00:15:49.620
That we have to we who are in politics have to seek to persuade the black you who say those things that you just cited I think it's necessary to to just prevail with them What I do as a as a Democratic district leader wherein I have a so-called clubhouse and I seek to attract young people and have had reasonable success with it I think that what I have found to be effective is to expose them to my thought process and to tell them that I believe there exists a certain amount of power and that power is is going to Which incidentally I always say power like fire and water can be used for good or evil I mean prison can secure great influence and misuse it so wish we are assuming obviously for the moment at least that the acquisition of this power they will follow their from the appropriate and proper use of it But if I can persuade them that there exists this power and that if we don't get our share of it no one will care and those others will go ahead to use it And I frequently say when they argue argue argue I say well what's the alternative And I have yet to have a young person give me an alternative Nobody wants a revolution Not anymore Not anymore

Speaker 9 00:17:11.520
The guys say it You say I don't mean it Of course not

Speaker 7 00:17:14.160.00000000011642
The guys all go out in Oakland California put down the rifles a long time ago and saw it through the election process to to secure some power and influence and and I My choice phrase is that we cannot charge up the steps of City Hall because they have larger guns and more bullets and more troops and bigger bombs and so forth And if this be true and if you will accept also that one cannot negotiate from a position of powerlessness and it is it is just not enough to make an appeal to justice and equity you have to make some demands and not do that You have to achieve some strength and you can do that through this election process by registering people If you go down to threaten what we are going to do if the man says you don't vote anyhow if at least we able to say Yeah but we are able to vote because we are now qualified to vote we are registered but if we lack the registration sufficiently great to make a threat then obviously the people to whom we go with these appeals are aware of it and I think that the future belongs to our youth

Speaker 9 00:18:25.250
You know the question that had a little bit though I know they have it they are the ones that get these out That could be the best times ever

Speaker 7 00:18:32.390
Know I've got as you know children college age children who I think will reap the benefits of efforts that you and I and others make now And therefore I don't have any qualms about asking young people to assist in this cause I think they ought to assess that and I think they should do those political and civic things necessary to assist in the acquisition of power and influence

Speaker 4 00:18:58.710
Well however their argument is that people like us who are in a position of influencing public policy in one way or another don't ask for enough They say that we settle too low down the scale We don't really ask for enough Now in the political halls you know that it's basically the game is compromise That's one thing to ask but if you start out asking a little that generally means you get a little For example let's look at the Democratic platform a platform Most people are espousing in terms of full employment They're asking for the Humphrey Hawkins bill which is a bill which provides government input into maintaining a unemployment rate of no more than 3 percent Now some people are saying well look who you are settling for 3 percent unemployment by the time you negotiate you go here down to five Why not take a stance that every able bodied man and woman should work And if there is which Humphrey Hawkins basically does take but not even to allow the fluctuation of 3 percent unemployment how would you answer someone dies with that you've got to get the legislation passed

Speaker 7 00:20:08.310
And many of our white liberal reform friends take positions of inflexibility on occasion which result in and I blame many of us for the defeat of Humphrey in 1968 and the ensuing years of Nixon and Ford which we just did not have to have but when we couldn't get a perfect person as it were we felt that it didn't make any difference we went fishing and elsewhere Well what I'm trying to say is that we have to be realistic quest And as we sit and talk with with one another I think we have to be realistic It may well be when we go to make the demands We will ask for 100 percent knowing in advance that we would be willing to compromise at 78 percent of 90 percent of whatever thing we're seeking But we have to recognize that you got a house of just under 500 members and you've got a Senate you've got to get legislation passed And that is a consideration So we have to look at what will go that is this is not to suggest that we should not continually pound away for For the The precise thing that we want But I think you have to be realistic because we can It is an easy position for any legislator to take To say that what I demanded job for everyone and I voted against all legislation that that would would have anything if they said 3 percent unemployment or one and a half percent unemployment I voted against those bills and I insisted I will only vote for one that is 100 percent employment That's nice That's a great speech But but it it is not effective that the position is not an effective one to achieve a reduction of unemployment I suggested that obviously the ultimate is full employment And not only is there unemployment there is underemployment and as you well know And I think we need to look at all of those things But I think we have to be realistic in terms of what we can achieve at the moment which does not mean that we just compromise away the whole ballgame but to demand that which we know is unattainable because it will enable us to stand on the corner and say see man we did it like you told us then I don't I don't think that's effective leadership

Speaker 4 00:22:33.350
All right now what about the situation which does arise as black people get into more elected positions where a black official is deemed by his colleagues or others to be not effective appointed official or elected official And then when he begins to be criticized by his opponents many of whom are black then says look you can't do this to me I'm black and you are criticizing a black man You shouldn't criticize a black man And it's interesting that some of the same youth who say that we shouldn't be be involved in compromise then come out and say well you should never criticize a black elected official On a practical level

Speaker 9 00:23:21.640
Yeah Hi Hi Good to see you How do you feel I like

Speaker 7 00:23:24.370
I think it is an issue that I vigorously dissent from added to that that we who hold public office and party position are immune or exempt from from criticism as a matter of fact I think it is our obligation I don't mean petty criticism And I think that that by and large we ought to try to close the door and do battle among ourselves if we can and then open the door and come forth and a united front But if if if some of us fail to discharge our obligations to to our party to our people to ourselves if if you will then blast it then we we just have to take the lumps and we I think have come of age We as black politicians and black electorate I think we've come of age and we will no more or should no more accept inadequacies and MIS and malfeasance than anyone else And it is not enough for a legislator to say well I'm black therefore I can do less than I ought to do

Speaker 4 00:24:31.210
And I think they ought to be subjected to quell this happens and I'm at this point I'm not going to call any names but there are some and have been some very well-known national black political figures whose voting record in Congress in terms of showing up for roll call is very poor when they run they are criticized as not taking care of business for the district etc. At the same time their argument is Look I'm busy being a national congressman for black people

Speaker 10 00:24:59.050
How can you expect me to make every roll call That's a tough argument to deal with And again for obvious reasons I'm not going to mention any names but it is the type of thing that could occur in a city council could occur in a state legislature and certainly it has occurred in the past and Congress How do you deal with an issue like that that the a black leader now yes alleges that he's taking care of so much business for the black community lives that he or she can't make the appropriate roll calls when it comes time to vote

Speaker 7 00:25:30.790
Well there there are those of us who point out that for instance Carmine Shapiro who was the county leader of New York County the so-called Tammany Hall he was a tremendously powerful man who became the Democratic National Committeeman He was very instrumental in the election of Governor Harriman here in New York State He was a confidant of presidents and whatnot And when Carmine who was a tremendously astute politician and when Carmine lost his district leadership in the Greenwich Village area he therefore became no longer eligible to be county leader and his empire crumble And I think that as Percy Sutton said when he first became borough president some ten years ago that he said to to to many to many audiences that he recognized the need to get into the mainstream if he would really be an effective executive But he must not forget where the shore is He would have to protect his district And you would find Percy Sutton on Mondays and Thursdays in the clubhouse and you just one cannot under the guise or the the the real genuine belief that of the need to involve oneself in broad national things Ignore your base It is It is not wise politically to so do that's for sure

Speaker 1 00:26:55.920
All right talking about a base and talking about Percy Sutton and other black elected officials in New York City

Speaker 4 00:27:01.440
What do you think the chances are of having a black mayor in New York City within the next election or the one immediately thereafter And I want to point up and I'm not making this question about what do you think the chances of Percy Sutton being the mayor Because certainly Percy is probably the leading black contender but really I want to ask the general question well what about it Can black Democrats and Puerto Rican compadres which comprise about 35 or 40 percent of the electorate in New York City and elect a mayor who is black

Speaker 7 00:27:36.990
I think the answer is yes But but but I would have difficulty divorcing it from a consideration of Percy's chances for that for the reason that to elect a minority Mayor where you don't have a majority of the populace of the electorate that is black or Puerto Rican to elect such a person You have to form coalitions and whatnot and it takes somebody like a Percy Sutton person who's got 10 years and a Board of Estimate he is as respected as an effective member of the Board of Estimate an effective borough president who happens to be black And I think that if as Percy has said if a beam does not run Percy will run and many many of the people who have supported him and others in the past I think will support Percy And I think that is very very possible

Speaker 4 00:28:29.710
And I think that's a good point at which to end our program is also a good lesson in practical politics

Speaker 1 00:28:34.500
Our guest on tonight's central reason has been David Dinkins who is chairman of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State

Speaker 4 00:28:41.130
And we've been talking about black involvement in the total POLITICAL PROCESS OF THE NATION Thanks again Dave for being our guest Thank you
