Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:00:22.860
The sound of the ensemble Al Salaam is the sound of the new black music. Here Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf and Mashujaa Aliye Salamu of this group discuss their exciting music on tonight's Soul of reason.

Narrator 00:00:57.990
This is "Soul of Reason." A program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:01:24.570
Our guests this evening are Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf and Mashujaa Aaliye Salamu of the ensemble Al Salaam which is a fantastic new group dealing with the exciting new black music. Glad to have you with us tonight, Mashujaa and Khaliq.

00:01:40.562
Thank you.

00:01:41.011
Thank you. Glad to be here.

00:01:41.931
Now, tell us about this group. Certainly just by the name of the group there's a certain amount of mysticism and excitement in the group and maybe in the beginning you could tell us what the ensemble Al Salaam means in terms of a concept and then tell us how the group that started. Maybe you could begin with that, Khaliq.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:02:00.090
I would rather for Mashujaa to start with that because-

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:02:01.650
Okay that's fine.

Mashujaa Aliye Salamu 00:02:02.941
Well we have a statement that's on the back of the album and I'll read it. Someone may ask you, or you may ask yourself, what type of music is this. Well it is music played by the ensemble Al Salaam. Therefore it is Salaam music. Peaceful- peaceful but not- but not weak. Fiery and yet nonviolent. The music is greater than the sum of our collective beings. But then there are the kafir, the nonbelievers who will hate this music. Those who will lie about it, try to steal it, or even deny its existence. Those who will try to define and label it, thereby limiting its ability to soar, to fly above the minds clouded by pseudo-intellectual reference marks. The music will survive all this is because it is truthful. It is dynamic and in fact it is our purest breath of life. Express each time we humbly touch the wood and metal of our musical instruments.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:02:57.020
Well it says very beautifully that there is a certain amount of spiritual impact-

00:03:01.951
-in your music and I imagine a group came together for that. I understand the term Salaam means peace. In a sense, it's in the new album you're dealing with which has just been produced by Strata-East records. It's called The Sojourner which is, as I call it, the traveler. Mashujaa said it's a seeker of peace-

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:03:22.260
Yes, of truth also.

00:03:22.611
-which is a beautiful way of looking at it. Now, tell us about the musicians themselves. What kind of instruments do you have in your group. How did the group happen to get together? Because I know you're all very young and you're doing some very exciting things.

00:03:36.251
Right, okay. The instrumentation deals with myself, Khaliq. I play all the reed instruments on this-

00:03:42.932
You do play all of them, on the album. Planet says tenor, alto, soprano, piccolo, flute, alto flute... Is anything that you don't play?

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:03:51.731
Well. [Laughs] Well I play other instruments, but it's, you know, some of those things. We also have Mashujaa who's here with us. He is on guitar. We have Andre Stromberg on drums. Malika Salam a.k.a. Peaches Parker. She's our vocalist.

Mashujaa Aliye Salamu 00:04:15.901
Leroy Seals on fender bass.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:04:17.671
Yeah, Leroy Seals on fender bass and Fred Kwaku Crawley.

Mashujaa Aliye Salamu 00:04:21.601
Who's responsible for that statement.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:04:23.281
Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:04:23.283
That's a good statement. It really is.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:04:27.451
Right. You know he sat down and he did it and it was like putting all our minds together when he put that statement together.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:04:33.270
Now in composing your music I see from the album that Khaliq and Bevin Turnbull have composed a lot of the songs, as well as some of the other members of the group. Now in dealing with the music, I noticed that you have a number of what I call different types of instruments. You have bells and chimes and so on. I noticed many of the black groups now are including these type of instruments in their music. Is this decidedly because of the African influence or is this just the normal creative movement that comes from exploring new ways to make sound.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:05:11.101
Well I think that's one of the basic difference from, I would consider, the music of the 60s and today's music. I think of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders had a great influence on this... on this part of the music. I think the basic change in the music is a religious consciousness. It's a spiritual order of things that I notice musicians are today's young musicians more involved.

Speaker 4 00:05:40.530
Now when you say religious I assume you're not talking about a particular religion, you're talking about a seeking of-

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:05:47.072
Truth.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:05:48.121
-truth and peace, and sort of a spiritual comfort.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:05:51.890
Right. That's exactly what it's all about. That's about... That's what we're about.

Speaker 4 00:05:58.440
Well on your jacket in your new album, you have a number of interesting titles and we'll be playing some later on the show. I know one is called Peace, "Salaam." Another one is called The Sojourner, the title of the album. Another one is "Ecstasy "which is a beautiful tune. And then you have A Vibration Love Call and we're going to hear that in a short period of time. Could you just very briefly tell us what you were trying to do through that particular song? That's one that you and Bevin Turnbull composed together.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:06:32.032
Right. It's a love song. It's a song for- for sisters, you know and-

Mashujaa Aliye Salamu 00:06:39.392
and brothers.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:06:41.520
-and brothers. [Laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:06:41.525
Love involves all kinds.

Kahliq Abdul Al Rouf 00:06:41.940
Right.

00:06:43.681
Alright, Could we hear "Vibration Love Call "?

00:06:45.334
[Vibration Love Call - The Ensemble Al Salaam]

Speaker 9 00:11:05.260
That's a beautiful expression of love. Billy you really should be really very proud of that.

Speaker 8 00:11:09.640
It's a great midnight music too. That's my first ballot to be written. I'm quite pleased.

Speaker 10 00:11:16.170
Well let's talk about the transition in black music from the music of the 60s to the 70s of course black music had such a long history in this country that two or three hundred years of history. Well the music that we sort of identify with is the music that came out of New Orleans the music that came out of Kansas City. The Armstrongs and the bases and then these sophisticated Ellington's. And then into the BOP period with Parker and Gillespie and then the music of the 60s which began to sort of turn things around. And then the music that you young folks are putting out in the 70s. So can you tell us a little about that evolution.

Speaker 11 00:11:56.650
Well we feel that the music should be responsible to the people you know in a sense because of the history of music in America. Black music does not really serve the purpose of purposes of the people. Most of the music that you hear on the radio it doesn't really address itself to the problems that we have and as you know black people have many problems throughout the world. And we feel this is about is the responsibility of the culture to uplift of uplift the people and let them know you know ways that they can creatively you know alleviate their problems.

Speaker 8 00:12:29.290
It's very interesting you talk about the problems of people which sort of suggests that the music has a quasi political purpose in raising that age old question. Are the arts just for the feeling are the arts to express something about the society. How do you feel about that.

Speaker 11 00:12:44.950
Well I feel that everything is political in this society and whether people realize it or not. And I think music is probably the most powerful political force. Now when you say political What do you mean by political political in the sense that it can help people be aware of the problems that are around them how they can straighten themselves out and make themselves better. You know take care of their problems.

Speaker 10 00:13:05.710
You know I think the themes do from the seven 60s to the 70s you saw some change because I was seeing some of the rock music music people like Fats Domino and so on that you really just talked about. Love you baby. You know what was happening in your immediate surroundings were some of the music particularly a group like they are Salaam deals with peace and a general spiritual love exploring one's self and then some of the other music has been even more overtly political.

Speaker 12 00:13:38.970
Well let us say it loud. You look like you're proud things of that time during the 60s. The music really wasn't allowed to be as expressive as it should be. I mean we were we were allowed certain modes of expression like you said love you know love you baby and stuff like that.

Speaker 10 00:13:51.670
You know it wasn't a thing where we could really say what was needed you know what does this then suggest new forms of music new ways of using instruments you know the basic form for beat of jazz or rock and so on is there. But now we begin to get a lot of more complex beats. Now is that an extension of the technology the use of electronic instruments and things of this type.

Speaker 8 00:14:21.730
Or is that sort of a merging of the seeking for new themes and new ways of expressing one.

Speaker 12 00:14:27.490
I would say it's a combination of both.

Speaker 11 00:14:29.140
It's about exploring the universe for everything that's positive you know using everything as positive for you for your cause and that's what we know we we go into traditional instruments some of the bells and chimes and stuff like that.

Speaker 10 00:14:42.460
You know this part of an African influence because I know that many of the groups that have a high level of black awareness are using more of these instruments yet as you look around you see many of the white groups using these instruments as well. So is it a question of a combination of extension of new forms and new sounds as well as a an awareness of African heritage.

Speaker 11 00:15:08.170
Yes it's true less to is on philosophy you might say it's about tradition and reason you know we feel that we have to go back to our roots. But at the same time you know we have to look forward to other things and it's a combination of everything that we can use past present and future.

Speaker 8 00:15:23.630
Right. Well speaking of past present and future How did you get to be where you are to be such an accomplished musician so young and to be doing some of the exciting things. Producing a record on a label which is from a black own company strategies standing tall and some of those folks. How did you get to this.

Speaker 6 00:15:44.770
Well first I went to schools stated NYU of course to have I started teaching in Mecca Evers College about two years ago and this is where I met the both of the musicians in the group. They are the college students and they were in my class you know and I had prior to that I had been playing with a lot of different groups and I've had I didn't really feel comfortable with the groups because I felt that they had to be a strong or unity amongst the groups it couldn't be just one leader per say. I think seven individuals working together well you know you can even triple the amount of success and taking care of business in one particular person. What I found with playing one person on one person as a leader you want to playing all of his music and so on and so forth. Whereas as you seen on this album on everybody's represented some of the tunes we write together and separate and all and generally what we do is we may write out a melody but we doesn't. We don't really write out each and each part each year each musician in the group adds on their particular part characteristics to that and that makes them the whole.

Speaker 8 00:17:06.329.9999999998836
And I think that's part of the philosophy of your group as well as philosophy music a certain amount of collectivism certain amount of interaction between each other. The one thing that comes across in this I talk with modern musicians is this word school making every one of our modern musicians have had some type of formal training not necessarily in a university but some type of formal training everyone reads everyone is able to relate to the music in a variety of ways which does represent sort of an evolution when in earlier days and days pass some of the real greats at least purportedly didn't read music or did not have formal training. Why is that is that because of development and music or is that because of the extension of opportunities.

Speaker 6 00:17:51.620
Opportunities number one but most hand musicians who have what they call so-called made in the past Billie Holidays and all the rest. You know other musicians at a time you know they were going out and they played in this. Do I necessarily know how to read music or whatever. A lot of them were starving and so young musicians say hey you know it's about time that we support our art ourselves. So finches This is one of the reasons why we have strategies and group like we have here today because not only are we planning to deal with music but we also plan to go into business often offer jazz coffee shops and things of this so we can do that next summer.

Speaker 8 00:18:36.930
OK well let's check out one of the other numbers on the album and then we'll talk about the black music business after that. Tune in circles. Honors those late night things. Maybe. They. Just want to be. Others those things. To be. Does not mean. Maybe. Me. That's a groovy uptempo tune I see you do a variety of things and one of the things we were talking about as a tune was playing is whether you do personal appearances because we were talking about black music and you were saying jazz coffeehouses and things of this type which represents a new dimension for black musicians because too frequently in the past they've been almost totally white owned and white controlled and their movements have been controlled by the larger society.

Speaker 13 00:21:26.120
Now we have black musicians like yourselves getting into dealing with your own business as well as artistic destiny. So do you appear in the metropolitan area. How do you group work.

Speaker 6 00:21:37.330
OK. What we have been doing in the past when we first set like about a year after we got together we join an organization called Freedom Sunday. It's a that has other musical groups in it. We had children's the Harlem Children's Theater on children you know at the Apollo. Right now at the Apollo was as in this organization. And what we did was go around the different college campuses running auditoriums and putting on concerts ourselves. We found that in I believe in this I believe that musicians have to support themselves. They have to make a business and a market for themselves in order to make it. This is the part of the old stigma that I find that I find in older musicians is that they felt that a lot of things had to be handed out to them and they lost a lot. But if you can plan you can know and you it's just a matter of planning if you didn't plan it you can play your music do your creativity and create your own shows. Is this likely uniform a whole creative production.

Speaker 13 00:22:46.490
That's what we're into. Okay. That seems really very exciting. On the other hand as a music fan you know maybe I want to check out your group and the typical thing that we've learned is if you look in the paper and you find out where people are playing at jazz clubs and you go and listen to them. Whereas in your particularly instance you really arrange your own concerts and so on which means that you're getting the world at large to know about you and to hear you other than on your record. Is kind of a problem how you approach that message. What are some of the things you're trying to do to let the world the metropolitan area the National World they play in Africa where I know about your music.

Speaker 11 00:23:26.270
Well like a brother said like our entire approach has to be very creative like we generally we go out and sell the albums. You know we push on ourselves. We have an arrangement with a try to East where whereby they distribute the records throughout on most of the stores throughout the world hopefully and we take care of the rest. We have an agreement and a half and half of women.

Speaker 13 00:23:49.270
That's the beautiful thing about Australia is that strata is is a black owned company. We had Stanley Powell our strategies on our show in the past couple of months.

Speaker 6 00:23:59.340
It's a it's a beautiful way for musicians to I think all black musicians musicians who go to spread he presently you know you can't lose by going. It's a little work but you can't lose by going into Australia is the only answer for like 15 percent of what's going on and that helps with the distribution. The rest is yours you know. And what more can you.

Speaker 13 00:24:22.410
And it gives you complete artistic freedom on the other hand the big sellers and not to any musician necessarily goes into music for money but that is one of the outcomes the big sellers tend to gravitate more toward pop and more acceptable type things things that can be played in discos and people can dance to and become one of these two months hits sell a million records you folks on end of that which really means it had worked a little harder to develop your art.

Speaker 6 00:24:49.010
Let me just say one thing about the difference between a jazz musician and let's say a rock musician you know a rock musician is that they make it overnight you know and the problem that you make it make it overnight.

Speaker 14 00:25:01.580
And if you notice they hit may be out there for about two months or whatever and then it dies down it dies out and a lot of times you don't hear about the bulk of them namely become a hit in the process overnight and then they just wonder they just go away. You never hear anything about them. Well I hope we're out for some time right. Whereas if you take out jazz musicians they can be around for 30 40 years just like Ella you know them. They make the same money is it is possible to make the same money but it's over a longer period of time.

Speaker 8 00:25:31.130
And then jury last longer and you enjoy your trade your rash and really throughout is. Well let's close the show on one of your really symbolic tones. Music is nothing but a prayer.

Speaker 15 00:27:35.620
That is music is nothing but a prayer. From the album The Sojourner the ensemble al Salaam and our guest this evening on soul of reason have been leaked. Abdul Al grew off. I'm a soldier.

Speaker 16 00:27:49.120
