Black players have made an indelible impression on basketball The City Game in the National Basketball Association two thirds of the players are black Here what's happening in the executive suites of pro sports from Simon Godin deputy commissioner of the NBA on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:45.490
Soul of reason is produced by the NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:06.610
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Simon Gordian who is deputy commissioner of the National Basketball Association And as we said in opening the show blacks have made an indelible impression on basketball and Simon about well Dean is one of the people who helped to bring this to the fore

Speaker 3 00:01:23.860
So Cy maybe you could tell us something about your own personal involvement with the NBA how you got involved with the NBA and then talk about your feeling as a black man in the executive suites of pro sports in this instance

Speaker 4 00:01:37.910
Basketball well fine Roscoe I started with the National Basketball Association in June of 1970 I came in I'm a lawyer I came into the NBA really in a very fortuitous way I had been an assistant United States attorney under Robert Morgenthau who's the current Manhattan district attorney and a friend of mine who worked in his office also left to come with a law firm that represents the NBA I then went to the Celanese corporation and I was working there and one day this friend told me that the offices had been restructured and the commissioner's office and that the commissioner was looking for an assistant who was a lawyer to handle the legal affairs the internal legal affairs So I applied for the job and I got it That's really how I started I really didn't know anybody in the NBA I didn't come with any references or recommendations but I found it to be very very rewarding since I had been there

Speaker 5 00:02:30.490
Now one of the things that a number of people are talking about is the fact that basketball is a sport The NBA and also the NBA have made probably more progress in promoting blacks into positions as assistant coaches coaches executives and now at the position of the deputy commissioner of the entire league Is this something that comes because of the increased social consciousness of the owners and the executives and pro basketball Or is it because blacks are just so damn good in basketball and have become such an integral part of the game and the success of the game that they could no longer ignore blacks in terms of putting them into positions of authority and executives

Speaker 4 00:03:16.300
Well I think actually it's a combination of both Taking the last part of your analysis first two thirds of the NBA is black in terms of the players And this obviously has to be something that everyone recognizes from from the owners from the commissioner to the fans and to of course the other players So it seems to me it's a natural progression when you have that kind of base for blacks to progress in other areas assistant coaches coaches general managers and the commissioner's office But I think it's a little more than that too because in other sports the pretty high percentage of blacks are on the playing fields But yet the executive suites are somewhat bereft of any black representation particularly in baseball

Speaker 5 00:04:01.600
Less so in football but baseball probably as a sport tends to have more limited black representation both in the coach's boxes until Frank Robinson just this year coming up in the managerial suite and in the executive suite very very few possibly Hank Aaron's brother and a couple of others and that's just about it And I this is not to cast any aspersions at any particular individual But I do think it does come from the traditions of the sport Baseball really basically was a country game

Speaker 1 00:04:34.660
Basically most of the early players came from the south at the time when there was rampant discrimination in the south and blacks just didn't make it as a matter of fact baseball existed almost 50 years as a professional sport in America before Jackie Robinson became the first black to become a player since that time blacks have won most of the MVP awards and then things like that But baseball still hasn't responded yet Basketball which as we say is a city game a game it came out of the ghettos the Irish ghettos the Jewish ghettos of German ghettos and now the black ghettos and probably tomorrow the Hispanic ghettos tends to have been more responsive Also basketball is a game where you have fewer players You have five people on the court maybe 12 people on the roster Baseball you have nine people on the field and maybe 30 people on the roster Football you have eleven people on the field and maybe 44 people on the roster So maybe it has to do with the critical mass maybe even though there's a fairly substantial percentage in football possibly upwards of 40 40 5 percent still the critical mass in basketball two thirds of a 12 man team is more people proportionately than maybe 40 percent of a 40 man roster Do you think it has something to do with it Or do you really think it has something to do with the awareness and the social consciousness of the people who are in the game

Speaker 4 00:06:02.670
Well I think as I indicated the first part of it is the fact simply the recognition of the number of blacks in the NBA But I think the second part of it which really makes it a combination of both is the fact that the the owners in the NBA seem to be a little younger a little more progressive than do the owners in other sports They seem more inclined I think to to take a chance to be entrepreneurial and sure to try to gamble and win and because of this attitude I think they just feel they're going to gamble with those that they feel are the best and not worry about the social implications or consequences

Speaker 5 00:06:40.230
All of those implications the consequences are always there because even basketball has had its up days and down days Elgin Baylor had to sit on the bench in North Carolina once and their cell takes Bill Red Auerbach plan to take the threaten to take the Celtics off the court because they wouldn't feed bill russell or Sam Jones Also in the South somewhere so the basketball has had its growing pains I think what you're suggesting is that the success rate the success of Bill Russell as a coach for example is your personal success as a front office executive has tended to say well a color doesn't really make that much of a difference certainly there will be poor black coaches and probably executives who are not as good as others who are black but also in the main When you choose a person on the basis of his talent rather than his color he probably will perform So that leads me to ask you the question at As a black person in a very very crucial position you probably have the highest position in organized professional sport in America possibly in the world

Speaker 1 00:07:43.650
Do you feel any particular pressures and or responsibility as a black in this particular position

Speaker 4 00:07:52.650
Well I certainly do I think that I've often heard of blacks who have achieved some degree of prominence and they say that they are somehow incidentally black and that I can't quite understand I think that black is a condition of your being and I recognize that we do not live in a colorblind society So as a result I feel very strongly that my actions might possibly affect those who might want to pursue the same interests after me And I feel that every day I don't mind it I welcome it It's a challenge that I live with but I do strive to be as good as I can as proficient as I can because I think that there are people who are watching me in a kind of goldfish bowl environment

Speaker 1 00:08:36.340.0000000000582
I say let's talk about Simon Gordon the person you are a graduate of Fordham Law School I believe that's correct and you're a friend of a good friend of mine Judge William Mulligan That's right And also your possibly related to one of our good people here at NBC Flash Gordon

Speaker 6 00:08:55.110
That's right I just found that out when I came here and it's very interesting and we're both going to check to find out whether we are in fact related

Speaker 3 00:09:02.250
Where did you grow up where did you go to high school and so on are you a new yorker or Easterner or are you a Southerner

Speaker 4 00:09:08.370
Well no I'm basically a new yorker My parents are Southerners from South Carolina But I was born in Jersey City and I moved to New York when I was for some 30 31 years ago So I consider myself in New York you are in New York

Speaker 7 00:09:21.390
That's right

Speaker 3 00:09:22.230
Over five years I've gotten into the swing of the year in New York back and everyone else is Are you a basketball player

Speaker 6 00:09:28.290
No I'm not I've played schoolyard basketball but that's really been the extent of it

Speaker 4 00:09:32.520
I often meet people and they assume I guess because of the position I occupy that I I must have been a professional player at least the college all-American

Speaker 7 00:09:39.990
But I hated Oh better than that Navy a third stringer who as you get older gets to be a first string dad right when you retire you're an all-American

Speaker 3 00:09:47.700
That's what happens to many politicians Do you have any particular interest in other sports Are you a fan of football or a tennis player or golf player What have you

Speaker 6 00:09:58.470
Well I like I like basketball I'm not as I say I'm just a schoolyard player but I do like the game of basketball very very much is no question about that I like boxing I've been a big boxing fan as a matter of fact I started in terms of athletics I started with boxing before basketball and that was my primary interest when I was a teenager

Speaker 3 00:10:17.400
That's very interesting a lot of blacks are around your age and some somewhat older have identified with the boxing before they've identified with sports like baseball and basketball That probably goes back to the fact that boxing was the first major sport in America really Horse racing was because all the great jockeys Isaac Murphy and so on and won the early Kentucky Derby is 89 years were black But in terms of visibility the Jack Johnsons and the Joe Lewises and the Henry Armstrongs tended to be images that many black youth tended to follow Now the images are you know Oscar a world of Kareem or maybe Hank Aaron or OJ and that's where we're getting more input into these team sports One of the things I particularly am interested in is diversifying the interest in the black community in sports We basically do tie in very closely with basketball very closely with baseball with football not so much with boxing now Boxing seems to be a sport that is identify with people as they come up more more and more You're boxing champions particularly in the light of the business tend to be of Hispanic background which is probably the newest emerging large group in our society But do you think that more and more black youth will be diversifying into other sports or do you think that because of the presence of television and the predominance of blacks in sports like basketball at Black youth are going to continue to just flock and limit themselves to sports like basketball and football

Speaker 6 00:11:52.200
Well on the one hand I just being chauvinistic in terms of the profession I mean in the organization I'm attached to I would certainly hope that black blacks continue to flock to basketball because the ballplayers we have any NBA are tremendously talented athletes

Speaker 7 00:12:08.550
I can see why you Commissioner I see that

Speaker 4 00:12:11.580
But I would say I'm on the other hand those as as a black person I would like to see the diversification and I think you're going to see that I understand with the tremendous tennis boom that a lot of blacks are becoming involved in tennis as am I I have just starting to learn the sport at this advanced age and it seems to be very very interesting

Speaker 6 00:12:31.410
But again I think you'll probably need some more identity figures I mean you have of course Arthur Ashe but there aren't many more after that has there

Speaker 3 00:12:40.320
GIBSON Well I guess it's the numbers in the pipeline for example when Chuck Cooper was the first black ballplayer with the Boston Celtics in the NBA We had other ball players men like Tyson Cooper and Peggy Bell and Dolly King were great basketball players but played with the Renaissance and did not get quite the exposure in terms of television Now you can't turn on a television and you can't go to a college game anyway One of the things that I found find somewhat apocryphal is that the University of Alabama where Governor Wallace stood in the door to prevent any blacks from going in in 1957 now starts a team composed of all blacks in the first eight players on the team of black and you can repeat this over and over again which raises the question some people have ask about pro sports and that is will the predominance of blacks in pro sports starting and all black basketball teams starting a baseball team has eight blacks on it starting a football team it has eight out of eleven players on the defense black Will that diminish fan interest I have my own particular views about it but I like to hear your views on that

Speaker 4 00:13:50.550
Well again I'm not certain that I could generalize for all the sports because I think if you did any kind of demographic studies you'd find that fans differ from sport to sport in their attitudes and in their perceptions But as far as professional basketball is concerned I would think not One reason is that it seems that the two thirds figures of black players seems to have stabilized Now whether that if that figure became 75 percent or 90 percent you might find a diminution of interest is a question that I'm not entirely certain of I suspect that fans are looking first at a winning team at the quality and the excitement of the play

Speaker 8 00:14:32.100
That's correct I think they want to they want to see their team win They recognize the team can't win all the time obviously but they certainly want to see a competitive game and they want to be able to identify with their local teams I suspect that even if the team is 90 percent black If that team is competitive and the fan can go home after a game and feel that he's been satiated in terms of what he's seen then I don't think he's got any trouble with it

Speaker 3 00:14:55.960
Know I recall a situation in one of the other sports leagues two or three years ago where they felt that they had a losing team and they had three or four black players and they said well we're still playing too many black players Let's get rid of the black players bring in more whites and it'll increase the fan interest What happened Just because of the the very building the players the white players that got weren't as good as the black players and they lost ballgames and attendance went down even more which tends to reinforce your point Then of course the point I frequently raise is that probably the sporting event that has attracted the greatest amount of money in the history of sporting events was the Muhammad Ali form and fight and before that the Muhammad Ali Frazier fight as well happens at both the main parties were black and no one throughout the world really cared You know what that color was they were concerned with the quality of their performance So I think that's a canard I think it's a very strongly racist canard and it does lead into things like having now we talk to be having a token black Now I started having the token white or looking for the black hole Now looking for the white hope and I think that really reflects too much the racism in our society And I'm glad to hear you personally say that And I would assume just on the basis of a track record in basketball at least that most of the owners in basketball recognize that they are not going to really be concerned if they have a team that has five blacks out there playing out or a team that has five whites out there playing now that the door is somewhat open I would say basically open most coaches I would assume have the intelligence to play the best players and if all five of them happen to be black that's one thing if all five of them have to be white That's one thing I think there is something about that Another thing that has come up as you talk about sports and that has to do with this idea of the difference in fans I travel throughout the country and I go to many sporting events in different parts of the country and just a couple of weeks ago I was in Chicago at the Chicago Stadium watching the Chicago Bulls play and I noticed that you had more family oriented fandom You saw people actually bringing kids and they would buy the hot dogs and sit down and gradually there wasn't a sell out immediately but gradually more and more people came and they tended to be less facially dressed and people in New York And and I had occasion to go a couple of days ago to the garden and you find very very few children Most of the folks very very well-dressed probably a lot more sophisticated about the game they would know when to cheer whereas in Chicago it wasn't exactly the ID exactly when to cheer What to cheer No that's between city and city within the same sport Now you mentioned the difference in fans between sports maybe you could give us some observations on what you think Let's say that prototypical pro basketball fan is like as against a prototypical pro football fan or an Eastern fan is against a Western fan

Speaker 6 00:17:55.440
Well I'm not interested I'm not sure I really know the difference I think that just picking up on your observation isn't really right because the situation I think that I think that's healthy and good in Chicago though because what what I think the NBA is trying to market to the fans is a kind of interest on a family basis because if you can get the younger children involved in the sport then you're really building a base for four future years NEW YORK It is true does have a more sophisticated fan but I think sometimes too and in all honesty the fans who come to New York to the game in New York probably want to be seen as much as they want to see the game

Speaker 7 00:18:35.040
But I think Hollywood too Right

Speaker 6 00:18:37.830
That's that that's an L.A. syndrome also There's no question about it But I I'm just not sure the what the football fan is really like I watch a few football games but I don't go to many games

Speaker 9 00:18:49.860
I think it's a matter of fact the games that I generally go to are the games involving Grambling with the Urban League classic and that's really that is a classic which really is a different kind of situation that's almost one of those New York fan things whereas as much important to be seen that the game and to see your friends That's absolutely right

Speaker 3 00:19:07.380
See the game 3 Grambling classic of the Urban League classic I think this year was North Carolina E.A. and Grambling has become a tradition and we've had folks on the show talking about this particular tradition and I think that's a very astute observation And also I find that astute that you're very careful in not making a very precise comparison on the basis of inadequate information which probably deals with your legal background Which leads me to this question that a lot of people are asking about sports no longer do you need to read the sports pages to find out what's happening in sports You need to read the law review or the legal pages to find out what's happening in sports and particularly in your instance you came into the executive suite as an attorney to deal with legal matters How much of your work as deputy commissioner is legal how much of it is promotional and how much of it is just basically administrative

Speaker 8 00:20:04.470
Well what I found I guess it's kind of interesting paradox but I found that the my legal work diminishes percentage wise as I have moved up in the commissioner's office

Speaker 4 00:20:14.790
As I indicated I started as assistant to the commissioner and then probably 80 to 90 percent of my activity was legal Two and a half years after that I became vice president of administration and then probably I would say 60 percent of my work was legal 40 percent administrative And now as Deputy Commissioner I would say it's been reversed so that 40 percent of it is legal and 60 percent is administrative

Speaker 3 00:20:37.410
Now in terms of the allegation that pro sports now are followed more on the legal pages of the pages of the law review than they are on the sports pages is it really true that there are a lot of legal hassles in pro sports and this tends to occupy the minds of the owners We all know the name of the game is making money I mean despite the fact that particularly baseball owners tried to sell it to the public that they were doing a public service running a pro sports team in their city I know that's a lot of bunk The basic purpose of pro sports team is to make money for the owners So therefore it is business But aside from that in the past the pages in the newspaper more and more concerned about the strategies and how they play and who plays rather than how much they get paid and who gets traded to whom and what kind of injunction you have against home So what about that

Speaker 4 00:21:32.190
Well I think I really feel that this is an unfortunate situation because I think the fan basically is growing just a little bit tired of hearing about legal hassles I think he wants to as you indicated he if he wants to know about legal matters he knows where he can go for that Certainly a part of the section of a newspaper that can tell him that there's sections of news commentaries that can tell him that or radio or television when he reads a sports page

Speaker 8 00:21:56.670
I think he's really interested in knowing who was traded He wants to know how many points were scored rebounds In other words just the essence of the game itself While it's unfortunate I think it's kind of a natural outgrowth of what has become an extremely sophisticated sport and sophisticated business because of that being highly visible there are people who are going to want to see if there are any chinks in the armor so to speak So there are antitrust suits that were involved in collective bargaining that can become quite complicated And we have high salaried athletes who are interested in becoming higher salaried athlete

Speaker 3 00:22:33.250
Well that leads me to a question it's a really tough question for anyone who's in the administrative end of sports and has to deal with these issues involving the reserve clause and play freedom and the fact that players are treated this as human chattel and are traded around et cetera It is alleged that pro sports could not survive without some type of exclusivity assigned to teams in terms of the rights that they have to use player services On the other hand it's alleged that players are being abused by just being shuffled around from one team to another sometimes in the middle of the season sometimes for less money sometimes for more money

Speaker 10 00:23:15.290
But nonetheless being used in a sense I realize that as the deputy commissioner you obviously have to be involved with maintenance of the entire structure so therefore you really can't attack that structure On the other hand I'm sure that people like yourself in pro sports with legal backgrounds and so on I'm very much concerned about issues of this type in pro football strike they were called the freedom issues in basketball are all kinds of issues about people who don't want to be traded and want to play out the options and so on What is your personal thinking about these issues and to what extent do you think they're going to be increasingly more important issues for sports officials and owners to deal with

Speaker 4 00:24:03.150
Well my personal feeling there are a number of the issues as you indicated the first probably is the whole subject of being traded a player recognizes that he can be traded This is part of his play a contract that he signs that he can be traded either before during or after the season and unless he has a very unusual provision in his contract which is the no trade provision that kind of event can occur and a no trade means not that he cannot be traded but he cannot be traded without his consent

Speaker 8 00:24:33.570
So this this is kind of a standard provision and I think most people recognize it is important because what we're talking about is the promotion of a basketball league and teams do have a need to fill certain vacancies I mean the men are not chattel to the extent that they are basketball players who are playing the game We're not talking about machines that are performing you know for the benefit of spectators we're talking about human beings So when you're talking about a trade it has to by necessity involve a human being being traded

Speaker 6 00:25:04.360
I find an aversion to using the name of a player being traded When I refer to it and we have a procedure in the commissioner's office that any trade involving any player in our league I handle in advance to give them an okay on it I always refer to as the contract player being traded that that just something that goes down a little more even though we've had situations where players are very much involved in team and he has a home and so on and the owner the coach negotiates trade and the player doesn't even hear about and to laughter he's on the court

Speaker 3 00:25:41.090
Halfway through the game and some I said Yeah I heard you've been traded Now it appeared to me that even though there might be some necessity of changing contracts just as you change from one company to another that there should be some kind of advance warning and some type of interaction between the employer namely the owner and the player who is being traded or is being asked to move Oh I agree with you I would have some equity in it

Speaker 4 00:26:07.430
Sure I agree with you 100 percent I think it's a matter of fact

Speaker 8 00:26:10.820
I think I know which case you're alluding to but the difficulty often in some of these situations is that it involves the other players and trying to coordinating and coordinate the time when you're informing your players in one city and telling the others because if you tell the players in one city and then you hope that two hours later the team let's say in New York is going to be able advise its team That's unrealistic because it is obviously a network there and the rumor will spread But I think the teams try to take pains to let the players know before there is a release time But again

Speaker 3 00:26:48.560
Let me ask this question because it's been talked about a lot of times What would really happen if they removed all of these regulations involving the option namely that a group of players could negotiate their services anywhere they wanted to at the end of a given season We do this in semi pro basketball all the time Now we play for the ABC Athletic Club or the Jones Jackson trucking company And at the end of the season yes they have a rule you can't change in the middle of the season but at the end of the season you can negotiate with anybody you want to and usually semi pro leagues work out pretty well I know the allegation is that the rich teams will get all the best players Is that a reality is that really the concern or is it just a concern for more or less a ease of doing business

Speaker 6 00:27:37.030
No I think it's a very vital concern of the league and of the teams that they're in because there is no question that when a player can leave at the end of a given season he is obviously going to go to the highest bidder

Speaker 4 00:27:51.320
This is this is a natural consequence of the free enterprise system The option clause that exists in the NBA protects an owner for one additional year It's not a reserve system where a player is bound to his team in perpetuity It's simply a one year extension of his contract which the team can exercise

Speaker 1 00:28:09.590
