A quota is a quota is a quota According to Sidney Hook the famous philosopher in a recent New York Times editorial here Courtney Brown of The New York State Division of Human Rights discussed the validity of this position on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:39.710
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:04.280
With us this evening on soul of reason is Courtney Brown of The New York State Division of Human Rights And we're going to discuss this very exciting and interesting and meaningful question of affirmative action quotas goals What does it mean Glad to have you with us tonight Thank you very much

Speaker 3 00:01:19.850
Now let's begin with the whole idea of affirmative action and being at the New York State Division of Human Rights which is supposed to monitor complaints regarding discrimination and even take action on occasion This certainly falls in your bailiwick and of course affirmative action comes from an executive order which proposed that there should be no discrimination with regard to race and religion and that not only should it be no discrimination but governmental agencies private agencies business should take affirmative steps to eliminate the effects of longtime discrimination And this has led to certain complaints from those groups that have had preferential treatment in the past to say that what if blacks want what Hispanics want everything They are pushing us out Quotas are bad et cetera What has been the general experience of the New York State Division of Human Rights on this and then we'll get more specific into the question of goals and quotas

Speaker 4 00:02:17.540
Well I think that the division has had a lot of philosophical problems One being charged as a state agency or a state agency brought into being by statute it was not the purpose of the agency in its original design to even contemplate affirmative action affirmative action only has come about because despite civil rights legislation despite official governmental agencies there was no give none of the institutions were giving the question of affirmative action you might also say well affirmative action would be in its roots The establishment of civil rights legislation I have a big problem when I say the philosophical question that I think people get caught up with words and then get it getting caught up with words emotions get attached to it

Speaker 5 00:03:26.450
But if you deal with the original FEC that in itself all the way back in the 1940s that's affirmative action in beginning of World War 2

Speaker 4 00:03:35.690
And the question is that affirmative action that has only come about because of a buildup of law customs and practices So the word is sort of a barely used word is a badly abused word and some misnomer for the simple fact affirmative action that only came into being for the simple fact that the laws that were being used to address themselves to the specific historical problems of exclusion I get very hung up on the word segregation or discrimination that the society excluded persons because of their color that in order to deal with the question of exclusion they had to develop a policy of affirmative action You see I get

Speaker 3 00:04:25.370
Of course you really hit it right on the head Now that has to do with the historical effects of racism on the employment and education of blacks Hispanics Native Americans and the like And what really you found is that because certain kinds of jobs require certain kinds of education and certain types of personal contacts and interaction groups that are excluded from the society by racism just never get a chance to get into them even if they in fact could develop those particular characteristics or if in fact some of them do have the educational qualifications And this of course leads to the question of affirmative action and I think we might view it as coming out of the civil rights revolution and the Great Society movement of the 60s where black people said despite all of these laws nothing is happening because of these internalized systems that prevent blacks and Hispanics from getting jobs and for moving ahead even when they are in an organization where there's some possibility mobility and more recently because of Title 9 Now the Education Amendments Act which deals with women The issue has become broadened and I understand that there is some legislation that either has been contemplated or recently passed dealing with the handicapped And I do know that in New York State at least the aged covered

Speaker 5 00:05:47.810
I don't see a whole panoply of affirmative We also have the end of discrimination We also have the Flynn Act which now begins to deal with the disabled Now what does this mean to an employer

Speaker 3 00:05:57.860
Because what you find as you go around you talk with people most employers will deny that they discriminate They say they want the best person and use the best person into be a white male the best person to do the job And by putting all these restrictions in terms of no discrimination against race sex or age or disability you are hamstringing handicapping their business that they are right to hire the best qualified and I'm certain that you must have heard this over and over and over again because you're a division with this office on the 25th Street must have heard all of these kind of justifications rationalizations complaints as you've gone into the whole question of discrimination in job It's like a broken record

Speaker 4 00:06:46.670
And the question is there is there is an assumption that quote the best qualified don't exist So you have a whole funny question that when that is poise locked into that also is the other concurrent question that there is knowledge that these persons do not exist And therefore because these persons do not exist we have to take less qualified people

Speaker 3 00:07:13.780
And of course there's another question that has to do with what are the qualifications Because we found in research and employment and testing is at many times the alleged qualifications for a job really have very little to do with what the person actually does

Speaker 4 00:07:28.070
Well I'm glad you raised that question because one of the characteristics of our modern society is that the average job quote does not is not really related to so-called quote the training a person is supposed to have received visa of a college or graduate school or trade school

Speaker 1 00:07:49.280
That's right I mean trade school is probably more related because if it deals with certain technical things such as plumbing or electronics it it relates at least at a particular level you are a repair person who does a particular job going past that though particularly into occupations that involve interaction with the public sales accounting law teaching secretarial work even there is a limited relationship You can't say no relationship but there is a limited relationship between training and qualification and then in the atmosphere of discrimination these rigid adherence to these qualifications as such can literally lead to excluding large numbers of people who can do the job And that is what has happened as a result of the Griggs decision in Georgia in which the court held that test used to select people for jobs had to be job related And that's the problem we have with the police exam in New York the fire exam the teachers exam all of which either have been are currently under litigation So that raises another kind of question but how do you answer this question about affirmative action ties my hands I just can't run my shop because I have to look at too many different people

Speaker 4 00:09:06.830
Well what you're good at my my argument has always been why don't you use the real gut issue that what you're really saying unconsciously is the excuse that is being used to continually exclude non whites that if we really deal with it from a theoretical base the country was founded on this principle it developed the whole body of law founded on this principle by the print this principle to the exclusion of exclusion

Speaker 5 00:09:39.200
All right See I going back to the car Yeah I come back to like quite even where three fifths of a man That's our situation that's created

Speaker 4 00:09:45.170
And I just say that we developed a whole thought history which is has affected the development of all human beings in this society We've developed the whole etiquette system a whole racial etiquette system where those who are excluded understand social distance and they understand that certain taboos quote You don't do The argument is keep those people in their place And I see no difference even though we're quote in the 1970s as the argument it was used in 1920s 30s and 40s that's the question is it's got a little more sophistication to it that there is for knowledge and the question of special treatment is very human If you have a child and you know your child needs help quote going to school you get a tutor if you have if you're a father you know that in terms your own children Some children need more help than others I'm just saying it is natural it's a natural response to want to help somebody who needs help

Speaker 1 00:10:52.610
Well now it's interesting having said that that there are some employers who have encompassed the principle of affirmative action and do some very creative things to find people of various backgrounds to work in their organizations I'm always impressed by these organizations that do in a sense establish a certain number of jobs for people who are handicapped and they do things in their plant They have ramps they have a particular toilet facilities etc. that make it possible for these folks to function and usually it turns out the record of these folks on the job is far better than the cross section of people Of course this is another form of discrimination basically people who are in the minority population at least initially when they get into a profession have to be better to get in and usually have to be better to stay in and better to move up And what does happen Part of the success of the movement in getting blacks into jobs is that we have a large number now And like any group of people there are some who don't measure up and there are a goodly number who do And the tendency is to say well you want us to take an incompetent person and push him up and I don't think that ever is the intent of this However when we look at a large organization it has 10 or Ido 20000 employees and say well by a certain time we expect you to have about 10 percent or about the same proportion of the total population that a minority group is in your workforce It's then a quota It's not a goal It's interpreted as a quota And this editorial at Sidney Hook wrote recently in The New York Times where it says you are dealing in sophistry when you say that a goal is not a quota I think we need some discussion and that's something that I know everyone who's been an affirmative action and human rights discrimination has to deal with What is your view on that

Speaker 4 00:12:49.610
I think Sidney Hook

Speaker 6 00:12:53.060
I've always had problems with Sidney Hook

Speaker 4 00:12:56.750
I've always had problems some as his intellectual development

Speaker 7 00:13:01.730
He quote thinks of himself as a philosopher even in his technical training and had to use logic He would have understood quote the extension of affirmative action that affirmative action if I don't care how we use logic then he might as well extended further by saying we don't need quote fair employment practice commissions we don't need human rights commissions we don't need any of these things that let the society as it is You followed me some by some queer using his word sophistry self-correcting itself because it's a natural mechanism

Speaker 1 00:13:45.200
Well in some way it might be sort of an overstatement because I believe he would take the position and for the audience should be known at Sidney Hook is an outstanding well renowned philosopher who recently retired from York University and is still very active professionally He would take the position that the most qualified as a person who can pass the test and can do those things that it takes to do the job And this reflects a dilemma which many people in the human rights movement have run into both black and white probably most reflected in Jewish organizations because Jews in the country in the past have been one of the most Negative have received this negative effects of quotas probably as much as anything particular going back to the old medical school quotas and the like So the tendency is to say well let's rely on a hard examination and that'll really ferret out the most qualified The problem with that is that it doesn't recognize the fact that in order to pass these difficult examinations Society asked to provide equity for everyone to get a high quality of education And because according to the Coleman Report the Brown case decision on a whole bunch of other decisions and research studies education in the black and Hispanic communities is de facto inferior then to put as the test a difficult examination which probably has very little relationship to one's functioning as a good deal of research that shows that people who get the highest scores on a bar exam or on a teaching exam aren't the best lawyers aren't the best teachers so the exam itself becomes a socially related hurdle which doesn't really deal with the issue which leads us into affirmative action But then when it's suggested that an organization you have a goal that they want to get by 1976 10 percent of their workforce all of a sudden some folk like hook say this is a quota Now how does the division respond directly for that position

Speaker 7 00:15:46.980
I don't think the division can and that's the point I'm saying that that division in itself there's some philosophical problems One is does one see that affirmative action in itself is just a natural development and being it a natural development It only came into being because people flouted the law flouted the law about and discriminate That's right And then the question is that it was so bad that government even recognize it had to take on that kind of responsibility

Speaker 8 00:16:19.830
So I guess I get very trouble with the Sydney Hooks who are quote logical thinkers and I might remind them that even though we passed the 13th 14th and 15th amendment we long recognize that we had to pass a special set of Civil Rights Acts because the society at that given time did not and could not see quote unquote slaves as freedmen and then the other question is that the courts wipe that out Now I wonder what well almost 100 years later it's right that in 1964 we got a new set of civil rights That's right So the question is that civil rights is an old reaction of government and an admission that it cannot guarantee the legal personality of non whites who have been constantly excluded from this country

Speaker 7 00:17:09.660.0000000001164
So I get a little bothered with people who want to isolate and develop word games around something that with a gut response they're being terribly dishonest about their gut response I have no problems if one wants to get into real extensions but what these persons do is the cut off the argument and tailor make it to fit their own visceral problems And how do you deal with that I mean the question is that quote The Human Rights Division can't handle something that's locked into a whole philosophical debate that most people in human rights do not see themselves You quote as a part of the government responds to the failure of government to meet the needs of all of its population

Speaker 1 00:17:55.170
Tonight on The reason we are talking with Courtney Brown of The New York State Division of Human Rights and we're talking about the concerns related to affirmative action and the allegation that affirmative action in fact means quotas is a form of reverse discrimination Courtney let us take a hypothetical case suppose a an agency in advertising for a position has said that they would prefer for this position to be filled by a minority

Speaker 9 00:18:26.940
Minorities are encouraged and a majority person applies for the job and doesn't get the job and brings the complaint that they were discriminated against because of affirmative action Obviously this is hypothetical it doesn't hold you or the division to any particular conclusion but what would be some of the considerations that you would look at in the division would look at and handling and complain of it

Speaker 10 00:18:53.190
Well ironically it has happened That's the thing Truth has always change it has happened That's right

Speaker 7 00:19:01.500
It has happened in terms of the pre medical program of the City University one of the free medical

Speaker 10 00:19:10.140
That's right A special pre med. That's right

Speaker 4 00:19:13.260
It is now happening in terms of the assault on medical schools where medical schools have talked about a new set of a whole new set of criteria

Speaker 7 00:19:26.790
And the New York State Department of Education has taken a stand on this issue supporting the attempt of developing a homogeneous body that this in itself is traditional in terms of American education that American education was not quote for the top echelon but American education has always been heterogeneous and therefore to be truly educated one had to interact with all segments of the population to be truly educated Now you've now have an assault that quote spots are now being taken by less quote unquote qualified people And I have to argue with people along these lines that at one time the Ivy League schools did not take in the poor but they quickly recognize that the students themselves were not being educated for the simple fact they had no interaction with the poor so therefore they quickly began to change quote the standards for the school body population of the hobbits the gales and the Princeton's that will once use quote as the exclusive training grounds for the top echelon of the leaders So my point is that you see I'm still bothered by the hooks and all these people who still don't want to admit that really what they unconsciously argue are their own visceral problems

Speaker 1 00:20:57.330
Well my visceral probably you mean their own emotional involvement in maintaining a system which might be beneficial to them at this point in time Well we really shouldn't talk about affirmative action without talking about the defense case which is the case at the University of Washington law student who was passed over in a sense to admit a certain number of minorities Turns out later he did get in and he did graduate and that is why when the case went to the Supreme Court he was declared a moot issue an issue that really had no particular consideration at this time On the other hand they will certainly be other suits where people did apply for medical school and did apply for law school and didn't get in because they were passed over by people who had lower scores on the lower aptitude medical aptitude But the thrust that's being taken is one that you just mentioned that institutions are now saying well we need to look at other criteria which really opens it up for example to have physicians who have very very high scores on aptitude tests but do not relate to people at all whether they be black people or white people or what have you

Speaker 9 00:22:05.330
Means it may be that that might not be the best physicians not all of them maybe a certain number might be able to function in certain other capacities but you have to have a range of people So this is going to be a key issue and I think as you suggest it's going to draw lines very similar to those lines that have been drawn in the past around integration Sometimes a cast of characters will change but basically it has to do with how does a society bring about equity when itself basically has built in inequity I think it's interesting that now that the job freeze the job market is tightening up papers are now saying that college graduates are competing with the poor and this is kind of an interesting twist of logic and some folks are saying well look businesses ought to give preference to the poor not to the college graduate Sometimes I would rather raise some question about the motives of business they have because conceivably a better educated workforce might put more pressure on them for economic benefits and a less educated workforce might not and that might lead them to that But this points up the problem of the haves and the have nots in the society And it's further complicated by race and ethnicity And in a certain sense sex let me ask just very briefly before we get into your avocation and having a black history let me ask you about the women's situation

Speaker 1 00:23:36.180
Has your division found much conflict if any between women and blacks and Hispanics vs v affirmative action because one of the fears that some people have expressed is that with the increased emphasis on women and affirmative action this will mean or could mean a decreased emphasis on blacks and Hispanics

Speaker 11 00:23:59.370
It does I mean see Oh you do think Yeah I think the problem is that I feel women have also been excluded I just have a big problem of how it's manipulated and used I think that anybody who is candid realize that blacks were at the end of the Second Reconstruction that the courts are being used to whittle away all of the kinds of supports that they've needed just to compete in the open society I'm very concerned about the new abolitionists I see no difference say coming back the hook and the garrisons who said well yes a slave we should get rid of slavery but that did not mean that the slave was to be a person And I have big problems of how people develop these funny little intellectual arguments being candidates where at the end of the Second Reconstruction I think the courts are being used as clubs I think what the contemporary Supreme Court as you mentioned at the fund is case they duck the issue which begins to get in to the very nature of the system that they were about

Speaker 7 00:24:58.890
And I think that if anything the reason why I said the philosophical problems with the division the division wasn't set up to deal with racism was set up to deal with individual complaints It has the bias of law And most of the people who are lawyers are trained in case law so they can easily opt out Now anybody who has studied law law has been used as a system to support the dominant group And my point is I see no difference in terms of the extension of the question of exclusion I come back to this word I don't like the word segregation I don't like the word discrimination I think it's much sharper and the sharp word is that quote non whites have been excluded from participating in the society Now all the ethnics who argue in terms of the backlash about the ethnicity of being minority they have been given opportunities to participate Now the question is that if the nonwhites were given a chance to participate some would have risen some would have been mediocre some would have fallen Now the big questions we've all of a sudden discovered the white poor which we never discussed before but they had a chance to tie in with the new emphasis on women

Speaker 5 00:26:15.160
Well Ed I believe that you think the new emphasis or increased emphasis on women is going to bring about decreased opportunity The only thing that I do is look at the box scores in the boxes are the proponents particularly black women who argue this maintain that it really isn't fair to look at it that way because you shouldn't double count

Speaker 9 00:26:33.880
You shouldn't count a black woman as both a black and a woman But basically the society should deal with both women and with me that's what they're doing

Speaker 7 00:26:41.540
See my point is that either we have to deal This is what bothers you that there is a candid set of facts showing that they do do this device I mean they use this device And the question is that what has happened We know that with the exclusion of the black male the exclusion of the Hispanic male what has happened is that the upper mobility of the black male within the system has been blunted the upward mobility of the Hispanic male to compete The Indian you know Chicano this whole range of things they've been excluded And if I have power I can manipulate any situation And that's the point I'm getting it

Speaker 1 00:27:23.440
Of course you very clearly point out the dilemma that officials of various governmental agencies have dealing with affirmative action Well we come into the close our program tonight but I thought maybe in a couple of seconds we might mention that you have an avocation which sort of reflected in your analysis of black history in the past

Speaker 11 00:27:39.520
Well I'm working with a group called the Kennedy project The Godfather it is Alex Haley who was able to trace his family back to the Gambia and Africa We have come up with some new findings which we hope will revolutionize the whole question of how do you look at the black family

Speaker 3 00:27:57.130
And I think that's a beautiful way in which the black intellectual can deal with some of his concerns I'd like to thank our guest on tonight soul of reason Courtney Brown of the New York State Division of Human Rights
