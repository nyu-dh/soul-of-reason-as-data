Speaker 1 00:00:02.320
In today's world of sport is exploding with excitement and energy What are the most important problems that face this world of sports What about the black athlete How does he fare in it Hear Al horn of the New York Times sports staff discuss these ideas on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:46.720
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:08.140
We're talking with Al Horan was a sportswriter with The New York Times and here in New York City And we're talking about this exciting world of sports a sports where all seems to have exploded in the late 1960s and the early 1970s And as we know the black athlete has had a tremendous role in this And I'd like to ask you out to begin our discussion tonight As a black sports writer do you feel that you have the same access to sports stories as let's say the White sportswriters

Speaker 4 00:01:37.480
Well yes Roscoe I think I have the same access one of the things that I guess provides access to stories is the organization you work for and a lot of times I would imagine that people really don't And I say at Harvard they don't hear it and they hear New York Times which is sort of an asset to To be to work for a paper like The Times of course I worked for The New York Post before And again you know the magic words I guess on New York and Post and New York and times when you're talking to an access as far as getting Getting close to Athletes I think the athletes sort of realized that you know the reporters are there to do a job and I usually don't I've never had anybody question me when I come up to do a story on them because they know I'm working and they usually cooperate unless they're in a in a bad mood There is some some confusion because I guess of the lack of black sportswriters around the country You might add that sometimes a black athlete will Sort of before you assume that I'm from one of the black news media like jumping to the Amsterdam or Ebony or something like that But after you get so over that it's you know really no problem it's just a sort of a funny little banal

Speaker 3 00:03:00.930
And what about the allegation that the sportswriters for the major dailies sort of play hand in glove with the professional teams that they don't criticize them that they depend on them for tickets to special events and so on and therefore it's very difficult for us to really hear what the real truth is about the world of sports

Speaker 5 00:03:21.970
Well I don't know You've always had I guess a certain amount of guys who you know no matter I guess if there were free tickets or not who were kind of home team routers and in every major city you know mostly the team they cover the the home team exclusive I think again being with the times and I think we we normally pay our way The paper pays our way to go on assignment or trips or hotels and a lot of towns the these the sportswriter is carried by the ball club He's you know he's we had that some years back at the times and that's why we changed the policy And it was one PR director was looking over the shoulder of a particular Times writer who wasn't writing something too favorable about the one of the ball clubs and the guy was saying hey wait a minute you know we're the home team

Speaker 6 00:04:16.660.0000000000291
And the reporter got his hackles raised a little bit and he he protested and the times subsequently paid decided to pay all their ways and I don't know if you know recently we've been up just about every paper I think in the city now as we were turning

Speaker 7 00:04:34.330
We don't really accept anything but working press tickets to events anymore we don't take two seats the garden for your family or something if you want to take them you pay by buying from the paper

Speaker 3 00:04:48.160
Well I mean I think it's a certain amount of maturity that's coming into sports reporting because for a long period of time it was thought that you know sports reporters were sort of gee whiz Guys and Guys we really wanted to be athletes themselves and sort of worship the ground that the athletes walked on and rode in like fashion But now with sports obviously being big business being investigated by Congress having its own scandals both of a financial and a personal nature It requires a tremendous amount of maturity to be able to see these things and to write about them because you are in the locker rooms after the championship game you are in the locker rooms after the defeat you do got into the courtrooms into the inner sanctum when somebody is brought up on charges of one thing or another And it requires I imagine a tremendous amount of balance in dealing with this Which leads me to ask you what do you think is the most important problem that faces the world of sport today

Speaker 8 00:05:48.130
Well I think getting along in this in this line one of the problems One of the things that's really come out in sports today is the sociological aspect of sports sports At one time was thought to be completely a diversion a diversion for entertainment What have you and now we're coming to sort of realize I think that the athletes actually Employees and while I think more than more than that the fact is that this is probably people people scoff at it when you hear of guys making one hundred thousand dollars and such and such but it's probably the less legal form of slavery

Speaker 6 00:06:30.140
And a sociological thing and you hear guys like I've noticed some some the black athlete probably was was more aware of it because he came from that background than anybody else But the fact that you know when a guy has a draft or something like that he's you know or trade or you know they're really actually what they're doing is they're selling body and soul and body back and forth and back and forth and I know that some guys when they sit down to negotiate with their contracts with various clubs because of the fact they felt that they just didn't want to see their bodies being sold back and forth they would go get attorneys to represent them you know and they just felt you know And I think John Brockman said you know he said if I'd sat in on a meeting and saw the guys the way they were selling me you know he said I would have you know didn't want to play football for fun anymore It would have been what it was like business It's a business And I think what is from the black athlete has kind of introduce this feeling and now you get it and you get this feeling now and in a sport that is predominantly white Say for instance hockey when they when the new league came out and they saw like the tremendous bargaining back and forth that's raised salaries fantastically You guys really actually saw that they were kind of being you know exhibiting what had

Speaker 9 00:07:45.100
Right

Speaker 8 00:07:45.970
And I think that's one of the things that the black athletes bought this kind of awareness to the two American sports for instance It happened some years ago I guess in the NFL players strike when when I guess John Mackey was

Speaker 6 00:08:04.470
The president of the players association they said prior to that the president of players association was you know kind of like a company union a company a union man you know and he really kind of like took the cue from the owners to the owners and they really didn't believe he was going to like you know hold the players out for any length of time

Speaker 8 00:08:22.390
And it was difficult because you know the the sports organizations are huge They have fantastic and competent public relations people and you know who can really sway the press who have all the contacts who have all the you said sway the press it's very interesting

Speaker 6 00:08:42.850
Well possible for a public relations person to sway a writer who's also there and sees well a thing is a lot of things that sway is access really access rather you know if you don't hear if you only hear one side and that one side is the one that has access it's you know it's it can't sway you it's like the same kind of criticism they had against riots and very other sources because reporters generally go to official sources you know for their first contact and they you know they say well I wonder if that other guy is out there and if he if he is maybe he'll contact me if he contacts me maybe he can persuade me to see his point of view But the other guy doesn't know that the reporter is saying you know that particular thing So police you know they said it in riot situations the press often had the the the police viewpoint and not the point of view of the point of view of the battle on the other side of the lines

Speaker 10 00:09:42.910
Well this is interesting because I was reading in the press the other day about a player well-known player who was criticizing his coach right after a game something had been done and he hadn't been treated fairly and the reporter reported it Now I thought to myself I'll bet he wishes he took those words back Now I'm sure that in a locker room a reporter overhears a lot of things and even is told things directly What criteria do you use Let's say in reporting the fact that a substitute or star player is criticizing his coach Rick recognizing that when that coach reads that criticism that next day he's gonna be mad as blazes at this guy and might actually not play him or you know do him in in some way

Speaker 7 00:10:32.470
Well you know it's it's a matter I guess of judgment just like any other news sources if you're if you're doing a Watergate story and you know that your sources are really inside the office and you're going to you know you're going to jeopardize you sort of do it a soul search piece a source piece or you maybe you you may have heard you know several different players voiced the same criticism and you can you know just sort of printed as news without without you know doing the source of sometimes I've heard I've heard players who've come over to me with say specific complaints and he'll say and print it you know and they know that if they're talking to you that you know that you have the access you probably will

Speaker 6 00:11:16.360
You put down what they just want to bring the situation to to a ball and there's certain certain players like I remember one of the famous things about like Joe Namath who was talking to reporters you know and he said something that was really kind of like you know hair raising and the guy says Joe can we quote you and he said you know like I said it didn't I You know and he was talking to reporters and he you know he said you know that was his his attitude he really He would always like you know if you quoted him correctly he would always back you up

Speaker 8 00:11:45.280
And say you know yeah I said it some guys you know who might say there are certain players you know who will say Yeah I said it you know and they want you to They want you to write you know what they say And You know I don't know I guess you view it in different different different lights if you want to You want to bring out a problem but still you know sometimes a guy is unhappy but you don't want to lose his job for him

Speaker 11 00:12:11.560
And I also like to ask him you know you know I can cut Joe said on the record you know that can cut your sources too in the sense that if he realize that you don't use good judgment whereas he told you this time when he's blowing off he may not tell you another time Yeah right But let's talk about something I know it's a great interest to you and particularly to me as well That's the idea of discrimination in sports So many things have come out now the Olympics and the business about the lack of a black manager in the big leagues and so on that have suggested that there is discrimination still against blacks in sports

Speaker 10 00:12:46.590
Now how do you view this Let's take the idea of the black manager I think copied the Times wrote a story the other day about how managers get selected You know it's kind of a buddy system since a buddy is all white and they select each other It makes it very difficult for black to become a manager Do you feel that there is an obvious attempt to prevent this from happening or do you feel that it's just sort of a business as usual thing that is bringing about the lack of blacks in managerial positions executive positions head coaching positions Well it is it is partly partly the buddy system and you can see certain aspects of it going on you know

Speaker 7 00:13:32.330
Your friends

Speaker 8 00:13:33.870
Even though you say you're on the same team there are certain areas where you know you don't go like a lot of people say what you look on on a football team in the black sometimes you know they they'll go sit in the back of the bus or when they when they land in a strange town The whites may go to one one watering hole and the blacks will go to you know to soul ville or you know someplace else And you know that social kind of relationship I remember there was interesting story about I know about Matt Snell who mentioned about he was on the Jets with The White Team These are talk a lot These were good friends but they would talk about different things The White teammate would talk about business and things like that when he was around and Matt was interested in business because now he's in stock market on Wall Street And he just mentioned you know why don't you talk to me about business sometime and the guy said really I didn't realize that you know you wanted to talk about it And it's kind of a thing that we get into a habit of doing you know Hanging out you know with our buddies and we do develop our friends and when we get a if you get a coaching job you want to bring in people that you know about and that you talk to and that you have confidence that they're not people not necessarily in terms of ability Yeah you have confidence in his people you know So subsequently you take someone who has a broader a broader view of humanity and has a sort of broader circle of friends And I think that's basically what it will take to get a black manager I think in baseball or somebody who is I think he's somebody who's gonna be a sort of like a rebel from a society somebody mentioned before that would be that Finley may be a likely candidate to to institute that kind of a thing but I don't know You can't have a towel a one point that I've often racist to whether given the fact that baseball is interstate commerce a class action suit

Speaker 11 00:15:40.950
Against a major franchise alleging discrimination might break this because it is pretty obvious that with the large number of years that blacks have been in baseball and the high quality of their players that it is more than just accident that not one major league club has a black manager And given the fact that baseball like all sports now because of television is an interstate commerce

Speaker 1 00:16:08.260
I wonder if a class action suit initiated by some public spirited citizens might not bring this out because we do have affirmative action programs now and organizations ranging all the way from AT&T to local industry is being made to make compensatory payments and to set up hiring practices that do assure that people who've been previously excluded from that particular job market are now included The suit doesn't necessarily say you have to hire Frank Robinson but it does have to say that within x period of time from a number of vacancies that exist at least 25 percent of them ought to be filled by blacks or Hispanics because obviously the Hispanics fare even worse than blacks particularly in baseball where they are a tremendous number But the number of Hispanic coaches is minuscule as well as the number of Hispanic people who are in management positions So I think that that might be an interesting avenue for some of you in the sports media to raise questions about it

Speaker 7 00:17:13.650.0000000001164
Yeah I think it's an engineer of course You know baseball in particular has always kept itself kind of above above these things by the fact of being exempted from the anti-trust and all kinds of other things that they got a hold of you know in the early days when everybody thought it was a you know a purely a spook sport you know rich people threw their money away on

Speaker 9 00:17:33.670
Yeah you know

Speaker 8 00:17:34.380
Whereas it's really you know a business or a job and actually it is in the realm of fantasy all sports are in the realm of fantasy And But I think they ought to come into the reality and I think you know all of the arguments against the the black manager in baseball are practically been you know kicked out because you know they talk about experience where or you know a guy with great playing ability like Frank Robinson can you know not only that he has managerial energy

Speaker 9 00:18:05.130
Championships right Caribbean league and they hire Bobby winkle out of Arizona State right

Speaker 8 00:18:09.760
Can never say hey guys who played or who never had any coaching experience in any in any league at all and they hired guys who who have not even been superstars I mean you know

Speaker 9 00:18:22.450
Matter if I got seems to be a prerequisite to be a manager to be a very average player at least

Speaker 6 00:18:26.840
And there's some merit in the fact that you know they say that sometimes superstars don't make the best coaches there's always a suspect because the same thing we were talking about Ted Wells because a guy always had such natural ability that he never stopped to really analyze and say teach younger players you know what was that really wasn't true about you

Speaker 12 00:18:46.030
But it was it was true you know student of the game

Speaker 8 00:18:48.160
And but you know some of the guys who've been great managers you know you look up there major league records and they don't look you know very impressive say Walter rolls and Dick Williams I think often has one time at bat

Speaker 9 00:19:00.340
Yeah you know but he has been a great manager

Speaker 6 00:19:03.160
He has been a great manager so it just kicks out the window You can't say and then you've have experienced guys besides Robinson you've had well with two black managers in the Midwest League this year one was Deacon Jones a Tommy Aaron Hank Aaron's brother was managing a savannah club I believe in the in the Atlanta chain

Speaker 13 00:19:23.420
He's now managing in Mexico during the winter leagues And you know he you know this guy

Speaker 4 00:19:30.580
There are guys around with experience so we can't say you can't find guys with experience You know if they want those guys but experience is not the sole criteria

Speaker 11 00:19:38.600
You know you know the biggest story in sports next year certainly will be the Hank Aaron story when he tops maybe his record and behind that is a tremendous amount of racism which has been mentioned in some segments of the press but other segments of the press I can't think of a sportswriter on a major new york daily who writes a column every day who says it was a shame that when NBC did this special on Hank Aaron they had to bring in racism

Speaker 10 00:20:04.060
Well to me that's absolutely ridiculous It's impossible to talk about Hank Aaron in American baseball with its white power structure and his challenging rackets and all of those racial epithets that have been thrown at him recently Not to bring in the question of racism And I really can understand how people in your business sportswriting business for example are so insensitive to this I'm not saying all but I think that many of the social and racial issues that exist in sport are sort of swept under the rug with what I call sort of a gee whiz school of sports reporting

Speaker 5 00:20:43.990
Yeah right I I think one of the you know one of the things you measure the racism in is not so much the things that they do to you as maybe the things that you don't get to do And one of the significant things that about the Hank Aaron story is that you know this is the first year that the guy really has gotten any publicity I mean he's a very articulate and you know he's not flamboyant but you know he's thoughtful and thought and articulate Randy I think now he has a he has a contract with you know appearances and things like that here's a guy that's been you know kind of almost a superstar you know for at least the last five years and you know he's almost a superstar a superstar Yeah well a superstar Yeah You know over a superstar and he's just getting really an appearance his contract now So it's like you know and he's just getting the publicity now and I think you know he handled it very well and and one of probably one of the reasons he did is you know he he's just you know laying back ready He's been ready You know Hank Aaron is just not popping out of the the oven

Speaker 12 00:21:49.010
He's been ready to accept the wider role I think in sports for some time but that has something to do with the way in which sportswriters tend to cover stories white or black they look for the guy or the gal who says the odd word who does the odd thing who is flamboyant in some particular way and that gets into something that you mentioned earlier that sports is sort of a fairy land for people On the other hand some of the sports sociologists are saying that sport is sort of a microcosm of the society and we play out in sports Some of the things that we value in society Loyalty for example aggression and violence for example Competition winning and so on And I think that it's quite possible that sport is a major means of communication of social values and that you in the sportswriting fraternity have a major responsibility and helping to deal with that

Speaker 4 00:22:49.460
Right it's you know it's it's amazing to me always because of the fact that I always say that it's weird you know we go into the locker room you know the whole gaggle of reporters and we approach some guy who's just hit the winning homerun

Speaker 5 00:23:03.170
And I always wonder I always wonder you know does anybody ever go up to the truck driver who's just made a fantastic U-turn on Sixth Avenue and you know and give him a long detailed interview you know what other what other job in America you know has this kind of attention and you know like a focus on it and really you know what does it all you know what does it all mean in the end you know in the price of eggs

Speaker 12 00:23:27.780
Well you raise about a lot of humility And of course as a writer you are basically a journalist Your beat happens to be sport possibly at sometime in the future

Speaker 14 00:23:37.810
Beat might be something else I mean a number of reporters who have gone from sport to drama to politics and so on And one thing that we do notice is that whereas there are many more black journalists doing general stories on the major dailies all over the country we still have a dearth particularly in a sports field We have some black critics in drama and so on we have some black political critics analysts

Speaker 12 00:24:05.900
But we have very very few black sportswriters Now why is that and how do you think we can bring about a change they have because since there's so much black input in the world of sport at least in my opinion they should be a better representation in terms of the sports writing in

Speaker 4 00:24:22.490
Yeah well you know it's a sports writing is is a good job One I guess one of the things is is example a lot of kids you know they want to if they want to go into journalism they want to go into something you know they think that's more serious I think sports is is plenty serious but some guys who you know they want to go into journalism they want to do news or they want to be a foreign correspondent know or what have you I think that there is probably a need for like more you know black sportswriters because there are so many black athletes and perhaps the black sports writer can sort of like bring out some of the problems you know pertaining to the black athlete

Speaker 12 00:25:02.210
But now how does a kid get started let's say there's a kid who's listening to this program now and he's in high school How does he get started getting into the journalism that sports writing profession

Speaker 8 00:25:13.700
Well I'll tell you how I got started I started out really in high school I started working on the high school newspaper in high school

Speaker 5 00:25:20.930
DeWitt Clinton I think in high school the Bronx that's the largest high school in the world I understand I don't know it's pretty large now They've gone on triple sessions since I left a thousand So yeah something like three times a day I think about twenty five hundred When I was going there back in 1955 and I started out doing sports there and covering you know the sports teams and I also

Speaker 8 00:25:44.860
At that time I was covering swimming for the Herald Tribune All of those swimming in the Bronx was held a deal clip because we had the only pool so it would could cover like all the teams at one shot and Then from then I went to college and I just

Speaker 5 00:26:00.830
Experience worked on the college level became added to the collection that that was that at CCNY and I just you know worked at it And this is You have to do this I think in the face of a lot of discouragement from counselors and what have you because at the time I was going along there weren't any there weren't A heck of it They weren't as many black reporters generally speaking as there are today You know I think at that time I remember only the hosting of the You know and and guys were telling me listen kid you're you know you're not too you're pretty smart why don't you be a doctor or a lawyer or something you can get into You know you get your into but I think that the journalism training whatever you're going to go into it helps you in in expressing yourself

Speaker 6 00:26:46.540
And I think that journalism helped me in doing you know in passing history and in passing English and doing math and you know and I used to say well if even if I just be a bricklayer I think it'll help me to to study this particular thing because when you get into communications you are into actually the business of life I think or living And I think that if a guy is interested you should stick with it And you know and take all the journalism courses he can and work On all of the newspapers he can whether he gets call or not

Speaker 1 00:27:21.820
That's right You know you have to start

Speaker 8 00:27:24.130
You have to have a place to be bad You know like just like when you're an actor you know you have to have someplace to be on the road And they say about boxing and things like that Now the guys you know there right away on national television but in the old days they had clubs to be bad

Speaker 12 00:27:41.170
Well gee Al you have said it about as well as it could be said if any youngster or any person whether he's young or not or she is young or not is thinking about going into sports right and you really sort of laid out the map and through your example your role modeling your interest your enthusiasm you've shown where it is where it is and where we have to go Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been al Harvin Sportswriter of the New York Times discussing the exploding world of sport and its impact on the black athlete Thanks for being with us Thank you
