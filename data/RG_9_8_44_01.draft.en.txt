Speaker 1 00:00:01.730
1974 will be known as the year of Watergate As a result of the Watergate revelations substantial changes have happened in the political life of our country

Speaker 2 00:00:13.250
What will these changes mean to black Americans With us tonight on soul of reason is Basil Paterson of the Democratic National Committee to discuss these questions

Speaker 3 00:00:44.580
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 2 00:01:11.370
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Basil Patterson vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a black person who has been right into the core of the politics in the system of our society And since we've talked about the political story of the year being Watergate Let's get right to the core of the question What will the impact of Watergate be on black Americans

Speaker 4 00:01:38.940
I'm not quite sure the impact is going to be that great on black Americans I doubt very much that there are many black people in this country who were surprised by the revelations that were forthcoming Two years ago I recall making a number of statements concerning some of the information we already had The amount of cash money that was being carried around and handed over by some of those who were campaigning for the then President seeking re-election Richard Nixon But no one in the country seemed to be too disturbed about it In black America though everybody had a very understanding not about it they understood what cash meant I'd said that a lot people said I Continue to Repeat that we in our committee have always understood why business America uses cash when they claim that everything should be done by way of checks and other Means of certifying payment It always means just one thing it means that something illegal is going on Now Watergate does mean the country though is something else again It means that the country found that there was too much for it to swallow With the revelations that came out of the Watergate expose A's Now what it will mean to black America in terms of improving the conditions of life That's highly questionable I am not one of those was particularly encouraged by the new president I think he's a man of candor and openness a very attractive man very amiable but I heard a young girl say the other day After Richard Nixon Anybody would look good I'd like see what his policies are going to be We already know what he's done He has signed at least two measures into law which cause a lot of us to take pause Just being part of the of the urban America scene We know that what he did with mass transit was not good for poor people and low income people Namely forcing the Congress to cut its Intended appropriation for mass transit from 21 billion to 11 billion It means very probably that the New York City Transit pay will go up above the 35 cents which is backbreaking now for working people He signed into law with a great deal of fanfare new education bill which contained an anti busing amendment The code word the the symbolism that had endeared Richard Nixon to a lot of very reactionary Americans And now we see that there's a pension bill that received a great deal of fanfare in his grave doubt that it covers the workers who desperately need the protection of government

Speaker 2 00:04:14.100
Of course as you get into what is going to happen in the new administration we can't help but look back to what did transpire in the Nixon years In the years where the unsavory conditions of Watergate were allowed to fester And we said on the program before and some other guests have reinforced this point yet basically the nation got rid of Richard Nixon because he was afraid of black power black political power black social developments etc. And as a result literally gave him a blank check to do anything that he wanted to Under the guise of controlling a society and controlling black people And what we found And I guess it's ironic that it was a black man who found the scratches on the lock has the Watergate burglars were in there Is that even white America couldn't stand all of the unsavory practices that were going on And in a sense they caught a lot of people with their hands in the cookie jar And this does create a climate for re-examination It's true as you suggest that the the new president has sort of put the squeeze particularly in terms of inflation on spending and since many defense expenditures are fixed it really comes out of social programs That's true But on the other hand is there not a climate

Speaker 5 00:05:43.880
In the country both in the white community and the black community that is one that says let's see if we can't look at some of the lessons we may have learned And I'd like to hear you reflect on what might some of those lessons be and what might be some of the actions that might be taken both by the Congress by the voter by the executive branch to try to benefit from those lessons I think the prime lesson to be learned from Watergate and what we mean by the expression Watergate

Speaker 6 00:06:18.170
Is the menace of big money to the entire concept of democratic government After all it was a four hundred thousand dollars and IPT pledge for a Republican convention It never came more But they got their quid pro quo beforehand namely that the president did make that phone call to that to the then attorney general Kleindienst who now has been convicted of a crime for failing to reveal that when he was asked during his Senate confirmation hearings the president made the call to tell them not to continue the appeal of the attempted merger of Hartford Insurance Company with ITC which took place society got its bonus got its benefit got its quid pro quo in advance We had the milk deal in of America pledging two million dollars and even wilting on that because apparently from all sources that have been identified

Speaker 4 00:07:07.400
They paid maybe about six hundred thousand but they got a rate increase of over half a billion dollars for one year so that the big lesson to be learned is what money can do to representative government and the machinery of it And yet I have grave question as to whether or not we've learned those lessons

Speaker 7 00:07:25.430
I think there is a great effort on the part of the people in government today to try to act like with the resignation Richard Nixon Everything is fine everything is the old expression is is copacetic So we can proceed and ignore it Forget it I don't see the kind of reform legislation that would really be effective in political campaigns It's interesting that George Bush who's now been named to head the American mission in China The chairman of the Republican National Committee he and I were speaking before an audience in Philadelphia a few months ago And It was forced be nonpartisan And he dropped a very interesting when he dropped a little remark that I say one thing let's make sure even a nonpartisanship and in a spirit of bipartisanship let's make sure we don't walk down that silly path of public financing of elections Well frankly that's probably what the only direction we can go probably because it's the only candid direction we can go Today the public does pay for all elections Let's not kid ourselves what happens by just example we've seen with Richard Nixon who paid for the marriage of Hartford in 1980 the public paid and create exactly who paid the milk deal is the public paid who pays And there's so many illustrations of it I mean made for San Clemente absolutely the public always pays

Speaker 8 00:08:49.580
And I think it's time that the public understood that it's gonna pay at least get credit for paying of course as you talk about the different types of legislation that might come forth And you really hit it right on the head the idea that Watergate is a synonym for political chicanery for political manipulations And the real villain is big money and you say cash is the thing is sort of amusing yet sad as to think of these great figures going around with ten and twenty five thousand dollars in their pocket

Speaker 9 00:09:24.260
Marines I'm going in the men's room and giving it to somebody in an envelope But Maury stands acknowledged that he walked down the street with a satchel with three hundred thousand dollars in it And Mr. comeback who was the personal private attorney for Richard Nixon acknowledged he had more than one safe deposit box or locker in this country containing hundreds of thousands of dollars

Speaker 8 00:09:46.220
And it really makes you wonder about the security of our country when men with this type of intelligence as well as morality are carrying this out And the real question is what can we do to increase the awareness Because really we've just opened the door and here's the public A lot of people really don't believe that a man like Morris stands

Speaker 10 00:10:11.570
So John Mitchell will walk down the street with one hundred thousand dollars in their pocket and they always thought it was only Al Capone That's right And of course a sense of who the real racketeers are the ones that we select

Speaker 8 00:10:22.490
And that gets into the question of what about our process what can we do to make our campaigns more lucid more clear Even in one of the current campaigns in New York people talk about a television blitz and all of a sudden someone gets three or four hundred thousand dollars and buys up a lot of time and goes out and shoots some commercials and pats few babies on the head and walks through Harlem and bedsides that we were the people and then they take the polls and all of a sudden yes that particular candidate regardless of who it is who is what that time has shown an increase in terms of people who at least claim to vote for him So what can we do you're in the political arena You've thought about this You work on these campaigns What really can be done to help make the American political dialogue the electoral process more effective Certainly we need to get more people to register to vote and that's a high priority probably highest But even after you register The question is how do you get to know the issues How does a society control the way in which the issues are presented Because even in public financing we still have those problems even just gave somebody some money that's still quite is the question is how can a society raise the quality of its political dialogue

Speaker 11 00:11:40.150
Well I think you've opened up a Pandora's box of issues there But on that question of money in political campaigns going back to the days of George Washington when from I just wrote an article the other day indicated George Washington turned out barrels and barrels of rum and rum punch and every other alcoholic beverage you could think of in his day So much so they came out of something like two quarts per voter where he was influencing the vote when he was running for the House of Burgess in Virginia I think we've got to understand unless you broaden the base Of support for a candidate financially As wide as possible then you're going to have narrow vested interests having a greater voice in what that candidate does after election

Speaker 1 00:12:25.780
When you say widen the base you mean widen the people who perceive that they will benefit from voting for this candidate because what I'm well I'm not just saying by widening it I'm saying diminishing it

Speaker 11 00:12:38.530
We have a candidate running for the U.S. Senate in New York today who said I will not accept contribution excess of 100 dollars Well that's putting it where it's at Obviously that nobody who paid one hundred dollars that candidate's campaign is going to be able to come back later and say you owe me something because the numbers involved make his contribution almost negligible and yet it's important now It goes it means that you move towards public financing You're broadening that base to the very highest extent you're saying the entire public Even those who did not vote for you contributed to the course of your campaign Therefore you are independent of any individual or any small narrow base who are trying to dictate to you what you will do That's one of the things I think the other thing that's that's just as important maybe more important is the caliber of men and women who we attract to politics For years I think we've all known that there's been a mysticism about politics that causes very able people might have an interest to turn aside They're always worried about who they're going to be bucking and who they're going to be competing with and confronting if they get into politics You know I've always said that if the INS who fear competition most who spread that worry the politics is dirty And then the outs who have the most to gain from getting in pick up that story and just send it around It was a do It means that the ones who should be competed with never get competition The people with ability and talent say Well politics is dirty I want no part of it I'm not stay in whatever field I'm in I don't want to get into government and all they do that they're little debating society is saying that John Jones is not a good assemblymen and and Martha Jones is not a good city councilwoman but they never go out there to find out what they could do that would be better if we broadened the number of people who are actually involved We will have again done something extremely important to the to the process

Speaker 1 00:14:45.130
That is a very interesting point Tonight on soul of reason we are discussing the impact of Watergate on black people in America and on the overall political establishment Our guest is Basil Patterson vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee Now building on the most recent comment that you made about the type of people we attract and broadening the base there are some real substantive questions there What we pay our political representatives is very very small We're having trouble attracting judges to the federal bench because I think they make 42000 honoring them and resolving them Where in private practice they can make two or three hundred thousand dollar Some of them will say substantially more when you attract an assemblyman to a state legislature for fifteen or eighteen thousand dollars and he puts in a lot of time One of the questions it does have to be ask is he must be doing it for something too And we do notice that lawyers who go into politics find their private practices burgeoning construction men who go into politics find themselves getting good construction contracts and are we in a situation where in order to get good political representatives we have to pay them more Or are we in a situation where the population in general should just recognize that people go into politics because they want to get something for themselves rather than because they want to do something for their society as their primary motivation What about that because it's frequently led when you talk with a young person or by going into politics Well yeah I'm going in that because I can see as a result of this I can get so and so and so and so there are a few idealistic youth and older people that I'm going in because I want to change it And this is particularly true of people who have earned wealth and now want to change the very rules of society and probably allow them to earn that wealth right

Speaker 12 00:16:50.150
What about immediately or that last remark I don't believe that there's virtue determined by man's affluence Oh no I like that last thing and you said those have already earned wealth and now we're interested in doing something to their society I think it'll be very interesting to see during the confirmation hearings in the United States Senate on Nelson Rockefeller whether or not it's possible for a man of his family's wealth and we're talking about the wealthiest family in the world family probably is a financially and economically the most influential in the world We're going to find out is it possible the man that enormous wealth to do anything that does not affect the added wealth of his family now but just on that point I believe that corruption affects anybody it affects poor people affects people of fairly decent means it affects rich people Different reasons some people want more money Others want more power Some want money to get power Somewhat power to get money So continues on that vein but I think that one of the things that we could do if we were willing to face up to the real world as a society and recognize the very things that you were saying a moment ago lawyers whose practices can increase construction men who can get more business and we can run down the list of those who can add to what they've got by going into public service and said A public office elective office legislative office as well as executive we've already done an executive we say legislative office is a full time post and you cannot hold another job And that we regulate how much money you can make on a lecture tour because we have to question what are you doing on that lecture tour Making money when you've got matters in your own district that need attention So I think there are things we can do and I'm not sure that we will have a dearth of aspirants for public office I say five years the state senate I found men in the Senate and the Assembly and women Who were doing a job who many of whom were lawyers who never went to their law office one day they gave up their practice their incomes did not increase diminished because they felt a sense of responsibility that if they were in the Senate representing 300000 people they had to work it because it was impossible to get all those people but they could get as many meetings as they could to hear what their constituents were talking about what they were thinking what they desired They are men in Congress who feel the same way they are women In all roles who feel that way I think if we set a realistic salary and then just sit on it because every legislator is always afraid that he votes for an increase in his own salary he's out of business Well we're finding different techniques to handle it Commissions have been appointed in various states and even federally who make the recommendation only way It's knocked off is if the Congress votes against it So that's I think it's a kind of a round about way it's greatly hypocritical but they're saying OK let's Change the salary base as is necessary I think you would get people would want that job because I think there are an awful lot of people in our society who do want to see things done who do want to see government function properly and are willing to make that sacrifice

Speaker 13 00:20:07.800
Well certainly services are part of the mystique of our country And I think just as we run into immorality we run into tremendous amount of morality just as we run into people want to use political office for their own ends or a goodly number of people who want to use it to help the public as they perceive it And of course this allows for differences in points of view that you can understand I think the real problem is when these alleged differences and points of view really of no covers for vested interest on the part of the people who supposedly are representing the public going into representing the public the basic unit of political organization local it seems to be the political club And it's always been alleged that the way in which you work is to go to the political club and you work for your candidate You don't get paid but the payoff is in something else you get a job You get some influence et cetera And this is just as true in the black community as it is in the white community as a matter of fact it might even be truer because of the fact that fewer people proportionately in the black community have really become interested in politics What if anything could or should be done with the concept of the political club being the basic unit of organization in politics

Speaker 12 00:21:32.840
I don't know a substitute at this time We have a system an electoral system that requires in order for a candidate to get on the ballot in the lowest office of the highest That he must obtain a certain number of signatures on a petition from his neighbors and friends Somebody has to carry those petitions Somebody has to get those signatures The bill the political club is the best vehicle for doing it I don't find it a political club is such a ha either I initially got into politics without a political club I got injured running freely independently with my own organization But I find a political club serves a very useful purpose and is a very effective instrument for getting information about One of the things you find in political clubs is that they invite People in who are running for office or in office who report to the people what's going on You'll find that most members of political clubs are pretty sophisticated about politics not all but most of them are They get a chance to meet and talk with the people who are in government As far as the patrons system that you're referring to I don't know how else to attract great numbers of people into the political process And yet I don't find the patronage itself is the evil It's our patronage is abused If a man has served in a political club he has served his community He has been part of the political process He has helped to make it possible for candidates to be on the ballot for his neighbors his friends of other people in the constituency to have a choice If he's got the qualifications that should be one of his credentials On the contrary I what I find having knocked Brown is the reverse That now you'll find the people running for office I won't name a particular office the number of offices and you've heard the comments I will not take a good look at anybody who comes recommended from a political club Well that's nonsense We don't have the political clubs We don't have the system functioning And where do you want to call the regular organization club in a district where it's an independent club in the District the political club is a vehicle which I find no substitute at this time And very frankly if I find it a major evil is the impact of the media upon the bigger campaigns Yes the media doesn't have that much an impact on assembly races state senate race accounts romantic race But when you talk about District Attorney or gubernatorial or U.S. Senate or Presidential you find that political club has very little impact on what's happening The impact is made by television pure and simple but and that's where we get back to the money problem those with the money not only get the time for themselves they blot out the time for their opposition

Speaker 5 00:24:16.430
Another point though you talk about the media its impact There have been a number of debates and media almost every week between major candidates

Speaker 14 00:24:27.710
What I find is that because of the nature of television the issues really aren't addressed Someone will come up with an alleged fact and there's no substantive information to rebut that fact or to reinforce that fact And so maybe a lie gets spread or maybe a promise it's absolutely impossible to fulfill get spread which gets into the point that we're trying to develop and that is increasing the police political sophistication of the total population And the reason why we raise a question about the political club is maybe there might be some other mechanisms maybe there might be some nonpartisan mechanisms not necessarily the League of Women Voters model but something like that which allows people who interested in politics and issues to debate them see in our society in the early revolutionary days we used to have debating groups where we would argue about where we're going It seems that cause our politics are so tied in with major political parties in the main and clubs that we don't have this opportunity for really open and aboveboard debating of the issues You know bringing a subway link to a candidate through Forest Park is a good idea For this reason and a bad idea for this reason What are the alternatives The incentives what we try to do in sole reason to provide forums for people to come and articulate ideas The rapid interaction so that people can make some decision but without telling them exactly what they should be

Speaker 12 00:26:00.800
The reason is done better on solid reasons because of the interview the moderator you because you're not being horsed around and taken down that Mulberry path to the extraneous irrelevant issues However I don't delegate television its impact on politics I'd suggest to you there's far greater numbers of people Have an intelligent understanding of at least some elements of the political system today than it had during the days of the Lincoln Douglas debates And I'd suggest that a good debater Abraham Lincoln was able to run off with a phony issue with Stephen Douglas and swamp him So it's been going on it's always gone on I think much of it depends upon who is conducting that interview What kind of programming is sought by the media Let's not kid ourselves They prefer to entertain and educate us and when we get to that point that we can put the two together Then I think we will be attracting an audience that's going to be edified by what is presented to them

Speaker 5 00:27:00.960
Okay As we come to the close of our program I'll put you right on the spot You're a black man high in the overall national Democratic political establishment What do the Democrats have in mind for black people in the next election Both the congressional elections and in the 1976 presidential election

Speaker 12 00:27:19.610
I don't know but I would tell you this very quickly I may be a Democrat but I'm a black man phrase and I understand the realities of the world I don't I would hope that we would get to the point where the Republican Party would offer some positive and constructive alternatives as things are now the only hope for black people as in the Democratic Party and we are experiencing is experiencing some very difficult conflicts You know what happened in Kansas City and we think that was a plus for us

Speaker 9 00:27:44.870
Blacks have shown again that they are leaders in that walkout in Kansas City of your recall The real walkout didn't occur on affirmative action Real walkout occurred because black leadership personified by Willie Brown and Barbara Morgan from Washington and so many others were able to understand what the issues were and how to coalesce progressive groups with them That's beautiful

Speaker 2 00:28:05.780
That's an excellent way in which to look forward to 1976 in black politics and American politics Thanks to Basil Patterson for being our guest on tonight soul of reason
