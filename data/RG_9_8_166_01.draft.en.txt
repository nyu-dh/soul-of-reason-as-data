Speaker 1 00:00:01.540
Is the City University of New York meeting the needs of minority and low income youth Are there sufficient numbers of black and Puerto Rican faculty on the staff of the City University What is the future of its special programs here Dr. Hilda Fortuyn professor of sociology at York College of the City University of New York answered these questions on tonight soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:48.500
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:08.660
With us tonight on soul of reason is Dr. held a fortune who is a full professor of sociology at York College in Queens which is part of the city university system and one of the things we want to talk about tonight Hilda is the effectiveness of the City University in meeting the needs of blacks and other minorities And I'd like to start out by just asking you a direct question that is how effective has the City University of New York through all of its branches been in meeting the needs of this special group of students

Speaker 3 00:01:38.840
Well the answer to that Roscoe I have to give you a bit of history and I know you're well acquainted with this It hasn't been too long ago that blacks were just beginning to come in to the City University in large numbers And that was around the time of what we call the black revolution

Speaker 1 00:01:52.730
Why were blacks not in the City University previously in large numbers

Speaker 3 00:01:56.600
Well there were no particular programs to bring blacks in and the standards were very high in some of the colleges and blacks by their standards

Speaker 4 00:02:04.640
Both did not qualify because that because they didn't have the ability or because of some other social phenomenon

Speaker 3 00:02:10.370
Well many many problems I was a Brooklyn College my first entry into the City University was Brooklyn and there the entry score was at the time 87 Now that's very very high 87 high school average 87 what they call combination they would combine the high school average and the S.A.T. every now and Yes And then a test which they gave it Brooklyn College And this brought it up to about 87 percent This is tough you know really tough to get in

Speaker 4 00:02:39.140
And because the educational programs in areas where black and Puerto Rican students tend to go generally are not as good as they are in the more affluent sections of the city This led to there not being a large number of blacks and Puerto Ricans and low income whites for that matter going into the city university prior to 68 69 Is that about Atlantic grand change And that was due to the development of the seek program and then later on the open admissions policy I believe

Speaker 3 00:03:08.210
Well again history if you recall when the students took over City College they moved the target date for admitting minorities down from 75 to to 60 68 or 69 It was only then that they began to take in blacks and Puerto Ricans in larger numbers They started with this open admissions program which is still being tested So now we are getting black and Puerto Rican students in and down the car layer to that is that we're getting more black and Puerto Rican faculty

Speaker 1 00:03:36.260
Well let's talk about the effectiveness of the program for these black and Puerto Rican students You said that the target date for admitting larger numbers of students who didn't meet the normal requirements was moved from 1975 down to us 1968 69 And this was basically due to a sit in Do you mean that physical pressure and the threat of violence caused people in the City University to do things that they didn't think was good judgment or they thought it was good judgment and because of the political protest they were able to get the money to implement the program

Speaker 3 00:04:12.470
Well they moved a little faster As I said they had a target date for it But I think the movement on the part of students activated their program instead of 70 75 they brought it down and they opened up the school quicker

Speaker 1 00:04:26.090
Well as a result of opening up the school quicker have these students been helped Has the university really met the needs of this new group of students As for example I hear that over 50 percent of the open admission students are white Well which reflects probably the economic situation within the city and are not all black or all Puerto Rican as some opponents of open admissions have said but taken this group collectively

Speaker 5 00:04:55.460
How effective has the City University been in meeting their needs at least in your perception

Speaker 6 00:05:02.340
Well I would say they have a good start but there's a long way to go Many of the students came in with some deficiencies and it was understood that the university would have supportive remedial programs understood by whom by the public and by by the faculty and by the administration And money was allocated as you know for the SEEK program and they did set up tutorial services and cloud Six program three dates

Speaker 5 00:05:27.560
The open admissions and the SEEK program was that search for education elevate elevation and knowledge did have built into it This extra amount of counseling and reading services and tutoring and the like One of the allegations that I've heard is that similar services were not built into the open admissions program And as a result the attrition rate has been somewhat higher than the average student who had been entering previously

Speaker 7 00:05:58.970
Well this is true The average turnover in the colleges runs about 30 percent The average turnover as I recall among the open admission students may run around 50 percent So those are the figures Yeah And some people say that the it's the revolving door that you satisfy the public by admitting youngsters who graduate from college but you have no programs to hold them there And they have set up a few programs

Speaker 6 00:06:26.510
If you talk programs and some remedial courses and some specialized counseling but there is some criticism that this is not sufficient that they're not not enough staff to demand these programs

Speaker 5 00:06:37.880
Well some of the large Midwestern universities have been doing this for years Yes taking in by law they have to take in anyone who who's a high school graduate and they rotate them in and sometimes that turnover rate is not 50 percent between 60 and 70 percent which at least in my opinion is unconscionable Now you had indicated that some moneys were to be had been made available and maybe have been made available by now to help alleviate this situation

Speaker 8 00:07:06.080
But some other people have suggested that some of the faculty in the City University who were already there were somewhat hostile to a new group of students whom they perceived as not being as evil as requiring more help at things which they probably should have gotten in high school and as a result didn't put themselves out to give them this additional help Is this a correct allegation is it something that only happened with a few or is it just a function of the size the vastness of the City University Well I think that

Speaker 6 00:07:44.600
You will find some committed faculty people who are very happy to have the opportunity to work with young people who have been deprived because of the system and then the system by the system by the Educational Complex Oh OK

Speaker 7 00:07:57.560
And I think you have some who still have an ivory tower concept of the academic world and they are so elitist and I think they they think they should teach students who come into the elite category

Speaker 5 00:08:12.320
Well how do you deal with the argument that says that if you have a student body I'm not saying this is in fact the case but if you have a student body that has a very very low reading level let's say the eighth grade when they come into college that this just pulls down the standard of the whole school Now I know that there are programs that are devised to deal with that situation but how do you really deal with that argument with your colleagues who say we used to have youngsters come in here with reading levels of 12 and 14 years and now we have to deal with youngsters with reading levels of eight years What is your argument as a colleague to professors who say this is cheapening the currency of a city university education how do you respond to that

Speaker 9 00:08:57.170
Well I respond very negatively to that I feel they have a responsibility I mean how do you respond to them to them

Speaker 6 00:09:02.960
Oh I'd tell them and I have said it rather publicly that there's a lack of commitment on their part and also a reluctance to do more work I think that is a challenge really to work with young people who haven't had a chance I don't think all agree with me but to me this is a challenge

Speaker 5 00:09:21.860
And in the long run I would imagine that you don't think it cheapens a currency No it's what you're suggesting then because of the extra work that it takes to meet this challenge that the people who graduate will be close to the same quality of the people who have graduated in previous years

Speaker 10 00:09:40.910
Is that do you think they should test the test is is how many are able to graduate and those who do graduate do meet the standards

Speaker 8 00:09:47.750
Well that might give some justification to the revolving door policy that maybe what they are doing by eliminating 50 percent in that first year is saying well it's 50 percent and can't cut the mustard and therefore we only want to work with the 50 percent who can What's your belief about that particular position

Speaker 10 00:10:05.750
Well I I think those who can have responsible to help those who cannot and take for example peer teaching I think you you know how this has worked out When a student who can helps a student who cannot both benefit but a student who can benefits more than a student who can Some of the research has shown this to be true in peer teaching so that when we use young people who have abilities who have talent to help the others those who have ability do profit they do benefit And I think this is something that the college has not pointed out So we have the myth that those who have talent are suffering and this is not necessarily true They are to be used by the faculty if they know how to do this They ought to be used to help those who who are having problems

Speaker 8 00:10:54.250
That's a very good point However my question had to do with the fact that maybe it is a good social policy to expect 50 percent to flunk out If you're going to continue to maintain the quality of the school and then I guess what I was asking you was whether you think that it's appropriate that 50 percent of the open enrollment youngsters should flunk out or do you think it should be a smaller number Well if you think it should be a smaller number Well if it is a smaller number how do you retain students who are not performing and still maintain the quality of the school

Speaker 10 00:11:30.400
Well first of all let's set this way I think those who are who are In college and we know this is true not only of the open Missions group but in college because of the pressure And this is very true You have to look the reasons why young people go to college some go to college because you under pressure to go some go to college because it is Vogue some go to college because they feel that this will help them job wise so that happens to be true Yes of course the last letter one especially that's more schooling the better the salary so they say I think those who who drop out perhaps are not college bound then what they call college material and we don't have to assume that everyone is and this isn't true only open admissions is true I think that the general college population and this is one reason you have 30 percent dropping out So maybe 50 isn't so many as you suggested a few minutes ago When you look at it from an overall point of view and we find also in this I think is a phenomenon that many who do drop out sometimes double back after they've had an experience on the outside world again And I used to counsel students who said well I don't know if I should be here And I said What did what do you think you would like to do Well I'm not so sure yet So I take time to think about that and maybe get a job for a semester and I find when I do come back they are more dedicated than because they wash dishes

Speaker 8 00:12:54.610
Well I do find it hard the world is out there Yeah

Speaker 11 00:12:57.670
One other thing that comes up in the whole idea of the open admissions is that it doesn't guarantee everyone a four year degree and guarantees them education commensurate with the interest and abilities and some of the programs in the community colleges at least are certificate terminal programs Once individuals learn a particular skill and then some of those programs such as in fashion or in computing or in metallurgy the salaries are very good even without a degree even without a two year A.S. certificate applied our social and flight arts certificate So I think that possibly you have a counselling vacuum I What about the adequacy of your counselling services We talked about the professors the way in which they teach We talked about the tutoring their peer involvement and tutoring What about counseling How important and how adequate are the counselling services provided

Speaker 1 00:14:03.190
Now in the City University for your open admission students

Speaker 10 00:14:06.280
Well I don't think we have enough counselors and I don't think that some of the counselors are prepared to work with disadvantaged young people

Speaker 1 00:14:13.540
Well what kind of preparation is it take to work with disadvantaged young people

Speaker 10 00:14:16.720
Well I was looking at a study the other day of a in-service training program in Phoenix And you mentioned earlier that out west they have made progress and working with disadvantaged young people This particular program was trying very hard to bring blacks in Mexican councils into the system because they felt they had an advantage of color The advantage of language for the Spanish speaking and they also had an advantage of being able to identify socioeconomically because many of us started from the bottom and they felt that if they could recruit more minority counselors to work with minority youngsters that the young people would have an up they'd have a leg up on this So they set up because they were not able to find qualified counselors who met the certification

Speaker 6 00:15:03.640
They recruited teachers and they gave them in service and they set up a practicum for them And as soon as they were able to work through their training they were move right into the counseling And this kept down a number of explosions which this this particular school system thought they were set up to have you say explosion You mean one student riots and discontent and dropping out

Speaker 1 00:15:27.550
All right well in the open admission situation the main role of the counselor is to help the student to mobilize his energies to stay in school And in addition to the counselors there is a question of the ID with minority faculty which brings us to another question and that has to do with the the adequacy of the numbers of black and Puerto Rican faculty members and staff members and counselors in the City University

Speaker 6 00:15:57.370
How is that shaping up in spite of the affirmative action program there still are not enough faculty and counselors and administrators black and poor you say not enough

Speaker 11 00:16:13.330
I then moved to ask a question What is enough

Speaker 6 00:16:17.380
Well let's say proportionate to the population and I use that because of a recent study that came out over the weekend And this study disturbed me It was published by the Carnegie Commission And in the study it suggested that By the year 2000 We still would not have The number of women and minorities in the universities in proportion to the population with the end with the population in New York averaging 25 or 30 percent black and Puerto Ricans A grade in New York We still have less than 10 percent of minorities in the City University

Speaker 1 00:16:57.520
I see now is that a purpose of thing where the City University just doesn't want to hire minorities or is it a question of available positions or is it a question of the training and the equipment that different minorities bring to the school situation

Speaker 6 00:17:17.980
I would say all all three of those Roscoe industry use the one that blacks never apply the academic world uses the argument that it's hard to find blacks with P HD which is true which is very true I know that in sociology we really tried this last year And they sent letters around to the press and they sent letters to the colleges and they went to the conferences are being held where blacks were assembling and we got no results on that because black pastors are very much and men you everyone's looking for them The Southern colleges and the colleges elsewhere Also this there is some truth in this but there are ways to do this Now what we did in sociology we had a very alert young man black who was working on his doctorate And he was working as agile at York and we worked this out that we would move him in as an assistant instructor with the with the expectations that when he finished his doctorate he would become a full time line person So there are ways to do it And I think if people are committed to it they're really sincere about it Affirmative action says if you operate in good faith and I think really if you do operate in good faith you can find some answers

Speaker 4 00:18:33.430
Well of course some of the answers are limited by the number of available lines or positions

Speaker 11 00:18:39.370
For example if a given department has most of its staff members tenured and the rest of them permanent and only let's say 2 percent of them or two of 40 people a black Puerto Rican this doesn't make it very easy to get somebody else in which raises some other kinds of questions

Speaker 12 00:19:00.910
Do is there a kind of a negative reaction among some of the staff to the affirmative action idea or is it just a question of lack of aggressiveness in pursuing blacks Puerto Rican and also women in the case of affirmative action Well you know that's that's a very hot issue right now because those who have are saying that

Speaker 6 00:19:26.320
The push for integration and hiring more minorities and women is discrimination reverse and they're saying that the affirmative action authorities are setting up quotas and this is really something that I think is beginning to tear the universe

Speaker 1 00:19:41.690
Well Art let me ask you the question do you think they are setting up if not quotas goals

Speaker 6 00:19:48.280
Goals

Speaker 12 00:19:48.910
Yes I would accept that suggests that some of the goals might be over the next five years if you're going to hire 10 people five of them would be minority women

Speaker 8 00:19:57.190
Yes I think it is being misconstrued on black to be well to be brutally honest about it If these 10 positions in the past had gone to white males to say now that they want to go to everything else being equal to blacks Puerto Rico's a women that in fact does limit the options of the group that has had the benefit of the system

Speaker 4 00:20:20.860
And I think this is something that people like you who are in advocacy positions are going to have to deal with I think it does involve a tremendous amount of understanding because the real argument that is difficult to deal with and that is that by hiring a black or a Puerto Rican or a woman you're actually not hiring the most qualified person And that raises some other kinds of questions How do you deal with that kind of question when it comes up

Speaker 7 00:20:49.460
Well first I would have to say if you want to get into the women and women bit there are qualified women within the system and the in certain fields in certain fields and the studies have shown that they are hired at entry levels at the lowest salaries and also the study of the university will show that there's been a dominant number of blacks at the entry level and that the lower salary

Speaker 9 00:21:14.810
Why do you think that is Oh well this is where the

Speaker 7 00:21:20.960
The lines are As you said before entry lines they really have full professor lines available They rarely have associate lines available Sometimes they have a system lines available

Speaker 1 00:21:31.160
I do know see situations where they brought into the city university professors and associates when they had years of teaching experience and the doctor's degree is it not possible at the predominance of blacks and Puerto Ricans at least at the lower end is due to the fact that not a large number of them have either the doctor degree which is the requirement for a professorial position all they experience is that a possibility

Speaker 10 00:21:58.280
That's a possibility And as we said before there not that many black P H D but I do think we have a responsibility to to encourage and to make available in-service training and also opportunities for people to work on their doctor while they are employed

Speaker 4 00:22:14.750
Because some people would say that the doctor's degree is really a paper requirement and it doesn't really mean anything And what we should do rather than trying to encourage blacks and Puerto Rican women to get the doctor's degree is to eliminate that as a requirement What do you think of that as a strategy in contrast with trying to get more blacks and Puerto Ricans into doctoral type programs

Speaker 6 00:22:42.620
Well I would go along with that As a matter of fact I was very well rather enchanted by program in at Kent College where they took welfare recipients to come in and teach about the teach the welfare courses because they knew more about them than some of the professors did who had not who had never been on welfare And they called in professors of the street I am quite willing to bend somebody's requirements to help meet the needs of the students

Speaker 10 00:23:11.180
And I think this should be the the the goal What can we do to get these students said of putting all the the the build up on credentials

Speaker 12 00:23:21.500
Well that certainly is a very good point However when you deal with the system and you have bends in the system and you don't have checks and balances if rather than these bends or flexibility is being idiosyncratic and her only occasionally if they become the rule then you do have another kind of problem

Speaker 11 00:23:42.350
It is certainly easy to criticize the doctor's degree as a requirement for a professorial position On the other hand when you try to develop a system where other things substitute for it it does make it much more difficult to police For example in the case that you gave about the professors of the street with the tenure regulation being as it is named after a person has been hired for a certain period of time What do you do with people that you bring in who don't have the credential flexibility because whereas the credentials are not always meaningful Usually they do assure that a person has been exposed to a certain variety of experiences and maybe rather than teaching just one cause he might be able to teach four or five

Speaker 8 00:24:29.690
So that raises a practical problem to deal with What basically is your model

Speaker 1 00:24:35.930
I know there is a faculty and personnel Association of Blacks and Puerto Ricans at the City University What are you really encouraging your members to do in terms of dealing with a movement within the city university system

Speaker 10 00:24:48.440
Well we had a meeting yesterday and it was titled workshop UNC careers for black personnel and in Canyon City University And we got on this business of credentials and of course people were encouraged to meet the requirements by getting the doctorate but we also thought that we also got into waivers and we know that there are a lot of waivers for people and this is some of the politics that goes on in this inner city university as well as other universities And we feel if as if it's being done for some it should be done for others

Speaker 11 00:25:19.430
Well in a sense you'd have to do it and probably a disproportionately larger number for blacks Puerto Ricans because not that many have the degrees at this point

Speaker 5 00:25:30.410
This puts you right into the political arena which raises another question about the fact that the city university is probably too politicized now What is your view in got to that do you think there should be more politics in the city university or less

Speaker 7 00:25:44.790
I would say less as you know right now There's there's pressure on the City University from Albany And everyone's crying politics at the same time we're not dealing with the politics that's internal And I think this is something we ought to address ourselves to

Speaker 1 00:26:01.230
How do you how do you best deal with those kind of internal politics

Speaker 7 00:26:04.620
Well I think the front of actions is is going to help a lot with this because as one of the speakers said yesterday Bill Zeller the president of the Professional Staff Congress which represents the City University instructional staff she said that you won't be able to say I have an opening send me somebody She said because of affirmative action you're going to have to say we have openings and let's recruit And we also announced we have to announce that you have to post openings and you have to recruit broadly and you have to show good faith by not only recruiting in the professional journals but also in the media where you will be in contact with minorities

Speaker 1 00:26:39.660
Well as we come toward the close of our program tonight I was wondering what your general assessment of the City University is do you think it will become more responsive to blacks and Puerto Ricans and low income people of all backgrounds

Speaker 7 00:26:54.570
I think it has to I think it has to to be true to its own own concepts and purpose and philosophy If you recall when the university was started 125 years ago there was free tuition and they didn't admit people and then we became a little elitist

Speaker 9 00:27:09.540
And I think the tuition was always free But the standards stand me up and up and up and now I think we're going back to our original purpose and that is to admit people give everyone an opportunity and support those who need help within the system

Speaker 4 00:27:21.270
But ultimately it does require a great deal of effort effort on the part of faculty effort on the part of the students and effort on the part of administration effort and commitment

Speaker 12 00:27:31.830
And as you say an increasing awareness of the political process related to the City University both in and out of the university Absolutely

Speaker 1 00:27:42.060
All right I'd like to thank you Hilda Dr. Hilda fortune professor of sociology at York College of the City University of New York for being with us tonight on soul of reason and discussing the impact of open admissions on the City University and various things that have been done to make the City University more responsive to the needs of blacks and Puerto Ricans Thank you Hold it Mr. Mayor thank you for having me
