Speaker 1 00:00:22.000
This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:24.280
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:00:50.030
On March 16 1977 at 5 Varick Street in Lower Manhattan our ceremony was held to celebrate the 100 fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the black press the founding of Freedom's Journal by Samuel Cornish and John Rush worm talking with us tonight on solar reason will be John pro Koepp who is publisher of The New York Amsterdam News and Billy Roe who is a dean and distinguished person in Black journalism We'll be talking about the significance of the 150 anniversary of the black press and Billy Sands you've probably been around a little bit long and John could you tell us a little bit about the symbolism of this one hundred and fifty years anniversary of Black Press

Speaker 4 00:01:34.340
Well thank you very much Dr. Brown I was aware that you would get a slide in there someplace and I've been around at least two weeks longer than John and three weeks longer than you

Speaker 5 00:01:44.300
The significance of a hundred and fifty nine anniversary Black Press of course is that based on everything that's been thrown at the black press it's a miracle perhaps that it was able to survive 150 years and it's growing stronger And it's very significant because it's called attention to the black press based on some of the things that we have done and some things we plan to do this particular year The black press is really I would say it's the conscience of America And I think that the black press it's it rouses though it doesn't rabble rousers And it's come through all the ages with all the problems and the data we have which reminds me that we we actually started 50 years after the beginning of New York State which I think is just just finish celebrating its 20th anniversary It's a little behind the country so we started we've been going for quite some time and

Speaker 6 00:02:39.950
There are many many angles to it that actually I think that Mr. profile probably would tell you some of the things and then perhaps we'll get back to some of things I think this out after that curve you threw me

Speaker 3 00:02:50.220
Now Billy if you think back to 1897 and I really know you weren't around at that time but do you think back to 1827 and you wonder what life was like in New York City for black people

Speaker 7 00:03:02.480
If you recall the Free African schools were just being founded The AMH church had only been founded about 30 years before that And these two men one of them John Rush worm who was the first the second black college graduate The other one Samuel Cornish was a very well educated man decided to publish a newspaper called Freedom's Journal

Speaker 8 00:03:24.850
And of course that really deals with the theme of the black press And John John pro cope with asked him news How do you see this concept of the black press as being the Clarion for freedom for black people even today is that the essential role of the black press or has that role changed somewhat

Speaker 9 00:03:46.280
Oh I think it's a continuing the changing role the black press started out as a fight for freedom The very name implies the that they were fighting for freedom today running of a newspaper as a business not that we depreciate the editorial thrust for freedom but freedom itself has many complexes and it changes in its connotation The black press has been in the forefront for Equal rights It's been in the forefront of civil rights that has been in the forefront for better education better jobs and a better lifestyle for black people And incidentally the spillover is that in its eventual quest for democracy for all people I think that

Speaker 10 00:04:42.590
The impact of the tributes and the things that the black press sets stands for has been manifest and the entire growth of the black community the black press has been the forerunner of a number of things

Speaker 1 00:05:01.730
Some years ago long before journalists were going to China I think William Worthy was writing for the Afro-American in Baltimore and Washington went to China and wrote stories on China when it wasn't popular to be in China

Speaker 3 00:05:17.600
I know and probably you read some of these events Billie when blacks were being persecuted in the south the black press was the only part of the press to publish those

Speaker 1 00:05:28.550
I remember when I was a kid the Scottsboro trial the famous Scottsboro trial of the black boys in Alabama who were falsely accused of raping this white woman became a cause celeb you could barely picked up a newspaper that was black and that read about that

Speaker 8 00:05:46.120
Yet if you picked up a white newspaper you didn't know anything about so in a sense the black press has had a significant role

Speaker 6 00:05:53.920
Bill you work with the leaves the associations called the National Association of Negro publishers the National Newspaper Publishers Association the Association of Publishers of the major black newspapers throughout the country And Johnson publication with his Jet magazine is also happen to be a member and this is known as the organized black press And Mr. Brock of course is second vice president And we just really began to have our thrust begin to be began to be felt We haven't been too active I should say perhaps in the last 10 years as organizations really sort of come come of age It's 37 years old and I think this is the 15th anniversary we'll hear more about the National Newspaper Publishers Association commonly known as an NPA

Speaker 3 00:06:48.760
How many members belong to that How many newspapers and publication belong

Speaker 5 00:06:53.440
Well we have to I would say we're about about 200 and some members but we have 180 members paid up so we usually go back to paid up members and that each one of those represents a particular publication

Speaker 3 00:07:06.310
That's true And those would be both the weekly and the daily and even maybe the bi monthly newspapers that are published throughout the country and the various elements of the black community

Speaker 6 00:07:19.420
Any newspaper that's been popular the publication for three years that they're eligible for membership and we're now tied in with the American Newspaper Publishers Association which is a so-called white organization and the N and a which is a National Newspaper Association and many many newspaper associations and we're sort of tied in with the major ones at this point Now John looking at the black press in the major cities of the nation New York

Speaker 11 00:07:48.580
Los Angeles Chicago Atlanta Detroit etc. How many of these cities really have large newspapers like The Amsterdam News I think the internet news has a circulation of ninety one thousand but I think that let me let me just hitchhike on your question a little bit

Speaker 10 00:08:12.760
Firstly you should understand that all the black newspapers have over a million circulation and the impact of that million circulation means that that's a million families which in turn means that it's four and a half million readers week after week after week

Speaker 12 00:08:34.690.0000000000582
Now how that relates to the big city newspapers as far as blacks are concerned all of the top 25 markets in the United States have major black newspapers Their impact is measured in many ways

Speaker 10 00:08:51.190
One is the editorial input The other is its marketing tool aspect and another is its threat of power which is so important as the central cities of America turn black The black press has been through its trials and tribulations They've had their ups and downs People tend to criticize the black press because of their under capitalization and the results of being under capital capitalize many times causes people to to misunderstand their professionalism and the thrust that they actually have for example up until let's say between the time of the First World War and the civil rights revolution of the 60s they the big thrust and the big impact that black newspapers had was in civil rights and fighting for that which black people are are entitled to after right after the 60s Black newspaper went through a transitional period as a matter of fact We have had to convert the big city newspaper from a sociological phenomenon to a marketing tool which means that we have to compete in mainstream America We have to adjust to the fact that your great black writers are now with many of the daily papers Many of them write for us and they come back to us but they do they feel that they don't have particularly young people They do not have the emotional feeling and understanding of the input for the black press Therefore we have to make adjustments for this type of thing I think the innovation of routes has had a great impact on what's going to happen to the black thinking about the press Many of us know that have been to black colleges and universities that the black history has been taught for years and years the events of routes to us was not necessarily new Yet it startled most of America and I think that because of that type of difference in the thinking that many whites and many so-called black middle class are going to view the things that we write in the press differently

Speaker 13 00:11:33.140
And I think that they will become involved more with what the black press has to offer Too often people tried to equate the Black Press of America with a daily newspaper We're not a daily newspaper We're a weekly newspaper and it must be regarded as a weekly newspaper We're not a mass media We are edited and and we relate to the so-called black middle class with some spillover I think black radio addresses itself more to the lower income our median income is much higher and therefore we we're not all things to all people And it's interesting that the the the the way that one must view the Black Press of today and of course now as you mentioned you do have a lot of black radio

Speaker 14 00:12:28.950
You have a number of black magazines like Ebony and Essence and on core that also are communicating and marketing agents for the black community So when you say that the black press becomes essentially a marketing tool I'd want to raise the question as I read the black press as to whether this is only one of its roles and maybe even not its major role in it as I read the black press I learn a lot of information about what's happening in the black community what's happening socially what's happening legally what's happening educationally what's happening in the artistic world for example the Amsterdam News has an excellent as an excellent Arts and Culture section so that I feel that it is both a marketing tool and also a tool of social communication and I think that the black community would have would be at a great loss if it did not have these particular organs True its role as a social protest organ may vary from time to time but as you said earlier is there is always the threat of protest There was always if the white media don't have it you can always go to Amsterdam and blow me away on a front page of Amsterdam So I think you're a little modest when you say that its main role is that of a marketing agent

Speaker 9 00:14:00.900
I think that it still has a major role as a social communications agent and as a socializing agent I did not mean to imply or by any means that the role of a business entity as manifest as a marketing tool is its only role I think that that is an important role for the survival of the black press and as it survives it survives to

Speaker 12 00:14:28.780
To to communicate with black people We see the world through black eyes We certainly endeavor to become topical so they are black magazines as black radio but the printed word is the thing that will interpret the day to day activities as it relates to black people Certainly our arts and entertainment section is one of the best in the city and it interprets one of the closest things to do to the reaction of black people because we are far advanced in the arts then we are in many other areas and I think that we tend to to interpret what's going on there We have women's features and fashions Black people are very fashion conscious as you know We have nine full classified pages which means that the the the daily papers are still not communicating to black people in terms of goods and services and apartments for rent and jobs that are really known to be able

Speaker 13 00:15:36.810
To to be induced to black people I think on the other hand we're the only newspaper in the city that has a West Indian page there must be three or four hundred thousand black West Indians in Brooklyn and we have a West Indian Ed in Brooklyn to service that particular community first time it's ever been done We have church news a hopeful a full page of church news every day that no other newspaper gives to the black community I use the term marketing tool so that we do not get into an ethnic connotation I think that we feel that New York City is a two part marketplace One is black and one white rather than to say that it is Jewish It is a tie in It is Puerto Rican One is black and one is white From a marketing point of view and the two and a half million people here are blacks that are here are certainly guided by the advice and the interpretations that that we give through the Amsterdam News tonight

Speaker 15 00:16:55.460
And so the reason we were talking with John Breaux cope was publisher of Amsterdam News and Billy row who is a well known expert in the field of black media and himself has been involved in a number of the great stories of our time And speaking of some of the great stories of our time Billy as you reflect What are some of the great stories that you have covered as a newspaper person

Speaker 4 00:17:18.560
Well there are many I would think that were really great stories And from the Paul Robeson concert up at Peekskill as you recall that I'm sure you old enough to remember that Marian Anderson singing before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington the total speeches the six month feature the Dead Poets myself we did on a tour of the south trying to compare progress in the south Black progress in the south as against white acceptance in the south Then that marvelous marvelous speech just before the war cracker generals did and then that campaign would send you overseas via the Pittsburgh courage you know I think we were quite quite a fighting newspaper and I really am very pleased with some of the stories and some of the things that the Pittsburgh Courier instigated and I was privileged to cover

Speaker 15 00:18:09.860
And of course since your days actually sitting at type I know you said the typewriter every week but your days really on the press desk you've been representing a number of the very well-known like people in the field of public relations as well as relating to companies like General Foods and other of our major companies

Speaker 8 00:18:30.640
And you look at the life of black celebrities today Do you feel that they have as much need now for a black person to relate them in public relations as they had back let's say in the 40s and 50s when discrimination was more rampant I know you were affiliated with people like Sammy Davis Jr. and you and the like and many of the other male black leaders and so on You couldn't give us names so many clients at the moment but I'm really asking the question about the extent to which black personalities need black people to represent them before the media as much now as they did in the past Well I think that they really need them more so now than ever before because we think in terms of equal opportunity and we think in terms of of job expansion expanding the job feel and if all the black performers had some black representation managerial wise or public relations wise they could open up an additional 5000 jobs in this country because he very few of the black stars really have black managers all black public relations people I mean there's a Sammy Davis of course as one and

Speaker 4 00:19:44.420
I know that Lucas Virginia Lucas it was I'm sure it isn't Virginia she's gonna be mad as heck with me I can't think of any reason to Victor Luke Victor Victor Victoria Victoria Terry Lucas she represent a number of coming black stars and it's a very healthy sign Of course at one time we did have queens booking which was the biggest black agency on Broadway one of the biggest in the country where they've had some setbacks but I don't think that the black performer really relate to the black public relations people or the black managers as much as they should In fact they don't relate to the black press as much as they should because now they can get into Susie's column or they can get into the daily news and Anybody write them up now you know and but they still that is what really the black problem is that the white press will really write this up but they don't really don't tell our stories So this is why I think that we need to have sort of a turn around and come in a coming together of the two

Speaker 15 00:20:45.070
Well I noticed recently

Speaker 16 00:20:47.360
John Neff Nam News did a cover story front page story on the attempt of the white numbers establishment to take over the numbers business in Harlem And I heard some criticism on the media both black and white saying that you know why should the Amsterdam News representing the black community take a position in support of an allegedly illegal activity

Speaker 17 00:21:16.330
And I use that term allegedly illegal because we know that the numbers and other types of gambling has operated in New York City for years with at least the covert support of the police even though our distinguished Mr. Row here was once a deputy commissioner in New York City Police Department and we give you a chance to get a little rebuttal on that later Velie But again what was the thrust behind that particular story and that type of story and I bring it around to that because that is something that was covered in the Amsterdam News it was not covered in the general cross-sectional press

Speaker 18 00:21:51.850
Well I'm not sure that I understand your question number one when you say saying why did you do it and what do you expect to accomplish by doing Well you said take a position I don't think that we took a position

Speaker 11 00:22:02.350
What we did we reported happening in our particular area I think the advent of numbers as close to the folklore of the black community Anything that happens in the numbers business has great interests in our community I I Have to repeat that I don't understand the nature of your question Of course it was news and we reported it I don't know what their what else there is to say I think what I think that anything that you know the numbers business and our community has been important for years Not only has it provided employment for many people but as I said before it's almost like some of the folklore And many of the black business entities that are very large today as a matter of fact one of the big businesses that was recently sold out of Baltimore started from no business And they are well one of the two that was on the stock market But the point is is that I think this is important the fact that the daily papers said nothing about it I don't think is significant because there are many things about black people that they do not report For example there is in my opinion an alleged boycott of the Percy Sutton campaign in the part of the Daily News and a part of the times the day before yesterday Percy Sutton about President Percy Sutton called a press conference and the news in the Times did not show up We know what's going on So it's nothing new to us that the daily press does not Publicize many of the things that happened in the in the black community

Speaker 17 00:23:55.060
You've never seen a bridal party in the white press for example of course by your answer you responded directly to the type of questions asking which was to flush out the type of story that the Amsterdam News might carry the black press might carry that the so-called cross section of the white press might carry Billie as I said since I did make the allegation that sometimes New York's finest tends to overlook certain things that are on the shady side of the business side of the law

Speaker 14 00:24:26.080
And since you were formerly a commissioner and did an excellent job I might add in community relations I'll give you an opportunity to give a little rebuttals to that particular point

Speaker 19 00:24:35.020
Well thanks very much Dr. Brown because actually you see you if you look around wherever the police is involved in when they are turning their backs so to speak or put name that they and somebody somebodies pockets you can bet that somebody higher up is putting their hands in somebody's pockets very because the police cannot do it without the help of the higher ups you see a little policeman walking a beat There's so many people above him and so many people above the detective so many people above the vice squad and signs of what it has to be a combined situation and all this has combined you see so that is really what the problem is And frankly I would like to see numbers legalize in Holland if it could be taken over by the Holland community money used to better the Harlem community You know that's so bad Not at all one hundred and twenty fifth street Do you do you know that the streetcar tracks that actually come into the ask for now I know that as a matter of fact it's very interesting

Speaker 17 00:25:25.660
This really has to do me there's a story for you as I drove along hundred 25th Street the other day I saw these tree contracts come That's it What are they allowing to happen to Harlem And you know hundred twenty three Street really is the capital of you know the black world in a sense everybody's talking about Apollo and all like that So that this in a sense again chosen need for the black press but as we come toward the close of programs evening John I'd like to ask you to really reflect on the future and the direction of the black press and respond to the question of what you think is needed for the black press to become a and even more viable force communications force in the United States

Speaker 9 00:26:10.560
Well there are several situations that are needed Number one the black press must become more responsible and reflective of the needs of all people For example today in the central cities as as black people become more populated and the school populations and most of our big cities now over 50 percent black If that is so then white people should begin to buy the black press Not every week but at least once a month twelve times a year to start to become accustom and oriented to black thinking and what black people think about That's number one Number two the black press as I said before must become involved as a marketing tool to service the retail business of our communities

Speaker 12 00:27:04.320
If they do that then they can generate enough money to employ more and better reporters more and better staff people and researchers and build a better newspaper and become professional and all of its aspects of the Rams of journalism and the Rams are running a newspaper and a large community But I think it must start with generating capital also Many of the papers are not financed correctly I think we have to go to the financial and the financial community and refinance with modern day techniques As to the best way to generate cash flow so that we can improve our property we must get out of black areas We must move to midtown This is important is no longer the Harlem is no longer the black headquarters As a matter of fact there are twice as many black people in Brooklyn as they are in Manhattan This is not generally known There is just as many black people in the Bronx as they are in Manhattan Therefore the symbolism that has attracted black people through the years is no longer there

Speaker 10 00:28:21.180
Thank you

Speaker 17 00:28:21.720
That really is an excellent analysis John

Speaker 3 00:28:23.980
It really is beautiful tonight on some of the reason we've been talking with John Prescott was the publisher of Amsterdam News and Billy row who is leading a black newspaper People in this country and it's affiliated with the National Newspaper Publishers Association talking about the 150 20th anniversary of the black press as a viable communications medium in our society
