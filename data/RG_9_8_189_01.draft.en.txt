Speaker 1 00:00:01.340
In the next few days thousands of black and Puerto Rican youth will enter or return to the many universities and colleges throughout the city What can they expect How well will they fare What kind of special help will they receive here Dr. John Mitcham chairman of the compensatory education program at Baruch College discussed these questions on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:51.420
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:12.300
With us tonight on soul of reason is Dr. John Mitchum who is chairman of the Department of compensatory programs at Baruch College of the City University of New York Glad to have you with us tonight Jack Good evening Good to be with you too Roscoe

Speaker 4 00:01:26.670
And we're talking about the 1974 school year beginning and based on our teachers you can see hordes of youth just marching out of the subways to swarm in to Baruch and city and Queens and Brooklyn and many of these youth will be black youth Puerto Rican youth and as we have read and as you know very personally many of these youth both black youth white youth as well as black and Puerto Rican youth have problems And what do invasive your experience do you see as the major problems that minority youth might face and also identify where some of these problems crossover with white youth

Speaker 5 00:02:08.400
First of Roscoe we are having declining enrollments City University will probably stabilize as to its total number of students this year And the overall enrollment will probably decline somewhat for the next two to maybe 10 years

Speaker 6 00:02:29.390
And that's similar to a pattern in many private colleges have faced although even with a decline I imagine your freshman class might be upwards of 30 or 40000 or something like that throughout the entire city university

Speaker 7 00:02:42.240
Yes but going back to your original question the overriding problem that's facing everyone today is inflation There will be less aid Everything will cost more Our staff needs materials All of these things will be more costly Paper for example has gone up almost 50 percent So the areas of what we call other than personal services everything of a commodity nature will be more costly in terms of the students directly Their cost and particularly minority students black and Puerto Rican students will have less money available to them by way of financial aid and the coast with which they would spend that money have gone up

Speaker 8 00:03:39.870
That's very interesting You know as I conceptualize the question I was thinking about it from the standpoint the educational social needs of the students And as an administrator which you are an very important administrator you looked at it in terms of how do you manage the educational resource the money that you given to produce the education And it does raise a very interesting point

Speaker 4 00:04:01.110
Many of us in education when we think about educational needs we think about what are young people going to learn and what type of curriculums are you going to present and tend to under emphasize the importance of the financial resource to provide this which in part might be really related to the type of questions we won't ask later That is why do so many minority students require special assistance And this goes back to the high schools which were underfunded and and so on but getting explicitly to some of the kinds of educational problems that minority and other students might face particularly freshman students even though there might be few of them they're still going to be all a lot of people they a lot of black youth a lot of Puerto Rican you are Oriental youth What are some of the kind of problems might you expect them to face from an educational point of view To what extent are they idiosyncratic to the Sydney City university or to what extent are they problems that any freshmen might face

Speaker 7 00:05:08.910
Well first would be our problems being understaffed to handle the various areas of remediation counseling and the other things that this particular group of youth would need but more to the heart of the matter The student really has many great needs relative to his own personal welfare Many of the students that are being admitted to city university start concerning themselves about going to college Really the last year of high school And they are not on preparatory programs for college which intensifies the remedial need and the nature of the remedial need to meet for academic programming The basic needs at Baruch are those of mathematics and reading These are two basic areas of remediation

Speaker 5 00:06:20.080
Primarily because Baruch is a business school and our basic curriculum is business We do offer liberal arts but in the city we are known for business and this is what most of our students come for

Speaker 9 00:06:38.360
Now you are really suggesting something that has been written about in the press and that is that many of the high school graduates namely young people who spent 12 years in school in the public school generally are not adequately prepared in terms of reading skills and mathematics skills to cope with an entry level college curriculum Man thought might be why is this so Probably an earlier thought would be is it really so is it really true that these young people can't read well enough or handle mathematics well enough to do adequately well in their freshman work And if it is true what seem to be some of the reasons for it And then finally what can be done about it

Speaker 7 00:07:30.190
One of the first ever dances and one of our difficulties There's very little articulation between the four year college and the public schools I'm sure you read recently in The New York Times that an effort has been made to determine the reading level of the high school graduates of the city to determine if if and what can be done to aid this group of youngsters in going on to college Well I think this is a pretty late date for us to start articulation but I'm very happy to see that some efforts are being made along this line So we really are in a quandary as to what the needs are what the extent of this need might be and the best ways to attract it Now at City University there are great differences of all of the programs within each individual institution We are currently working to coordinate the remedial effort as a whole for all of the units

Speaker 5 00:08:51.700
But again there is great freedom allowed in each individual institution being allowed to tackle its problems as the institution sees them

Speaker 4 00:09:04.000
Now at Baruch How do you protest

Speaker 9 00:09:07.000
For example we talk about college students not being able to read according to readability indices the daily news newspapers written maybe four and a half grade level reading The New York Times has written something like eight and a half for its a range really four and a half to six for the news an eight and a half to ten for the Times is a pretty particular at a time it's a pretty substantial type of reading

Speaker 3 00:09:37.000
Most college students should be able to read the Times and understand that What about your students almost your students able to read the Times and understand it and if they aren't What kind of programs do you put them into to help them to be able to do this I'm using that as an example so that the general audience can go beyond just scores and put it into some type of frame of reference

Speaker 5 00:09:59.450
Yes we're finding that roughly 10 percent of the students that declare their choice 10 to 12 percent of the students had declared their choice as Baruch either first or second choice are in need of remediation now are attacked for remediation either way

Speaker 8 00:10:25.540
That's a small number because at least according to what the press leads us to believe it might be as many as half of the open admissions type students who are coming in who need this help

Speaker 5 00:10:38.620
The other question I'm prompted to ask is How do you know that these 10 percent need remedial Well we administer tests in a English theme reading and mathematics And on the basis of our individual testing which is not the same testing that is provided say at Hunter or at City College or at Queen's on the basis of our testing then we place those students in need of remediation in some sort of remediation class The areas of remediation at Baruch are in mathematics in which we have special courses remedial math in English and reading We have two programs Basically one program that combines reading English and Speech in a common core program that is team taught called communication skills This is the rock bed group of need are rock bed a level of remediation in which students take this particular course for a 4 two semesters or an entire year Those students that we feel they're writing is of college level and acceptable but have lower reading scores are placed in regular classes of which we attach a study lab to the study lab is high Special reading class that helps a student in the particular academic course that they are taking We have found that it is much better to teach reading and involve the student in his actual work than to have a separate course in which we attempt to gear the reading level to say a fourth grade or fifth grade or eighth grade in which we would give material that would lack the interests or lack the help that we would feel that the student would see as viable to what he wants to do

Speaker 3 00:13:11.050
On tonight's sole reason we are discussing the educational problems of minority students in colleges with Dr. John Mitcham who is chairman of the Department of compensatory programs at Baruch College of the city university

Speaker 4 00:13:27.230
Now you talking very specifically about the type of reading instruction that you give the youngsters the youth really they are young in some ways but many of them are older people do give the students at Baruch and one of the things that I was thinking about as you were talking about the type of reading instruction you give them is what type of problems these students have or their problems are comprehension understanding what they read

Speaker 3 00:13:57.470
Are there problems and vocabulary Are there problems in using different tenses These are things that normally you would cover in high school and junior high school but from the way in which you describe your program and seem to be very rudimentary and admittedly if students have not gotten these skills in high school you must get them somewhere and you're doing a good job in trying to give them to them

Speaker 5 00:14:20.480
But what are the type of reading problems that these students have all of the problems that you have named and who are reading space this attempt to work with the students within small groups especially the study the study levels that I mentioned but one of our other basic problems that you could have guessed is that of language difficulty foreign backgrounds We also I think are innovative in that we consider English as a second language not just for our Hispanic students but for all students in that in our particular situation we are near to Chinatown So we have many Chinese students We have many students with French or Portuguese backgrounds so we attempt to attack the problem of English as a second language as an overall problem not just to provide special tutoring or special individual work for Spanish speaking students We also attempt to keep the student in the regular class as much as possible and then attack his language difficulties in small groups and within those small sections of the class classes the regular classes that they're taking

Speaker 1 00:15:55.480
Well it has been alleged though that by putting a goodly number of students who have reading problems into certain courses like psychology and economics and sociology it tends to diminish the quality of those courses because the professor has to modify the reading materials modify his vocabulary and as you know in some complex subjects the vocabulary is quite difficult How do you deal with that Is it such that the students who are reading problems just generally tend to get lower grades or are the courses actually watered down I know I hate to use that type of term because I and many others like myself are completely in agreement with the idea of providing compensatory programs in colleges But one of the allegations is that putting students who have reading difficulty into the basic courses does tend to water down the course

Speaker 5 00:16:57.440
Yes this is the common fear of the entire academic community You touched upon one of the things that we attempt to do and that is to keep these numbers small in individual sections and we tried to not create difficulties for the instructor because we do not interfere with the academic process in terms of request for special favors for students within a particular academic course In fact quite to the contrary we attempt not to identify those students that are having reading problems or study skills difficulties And I think one of the things that we have done and has been successful is our study lab program We have had some instructors request the placement of students in the study lab that apparently had tested high enough to not indicate that they were in need of remediation So I think that by working with small numbers and attempting to individualize the study labs and also keep these as to small groups and I when I speak of small groups the maximum size group that we have for remediation for an exact course would be 15 whereas study labs We attempt to control this number two not over 15 in a particular section and then we also tried to seed the course with different kinds of problems so that we will not have a number of students say in a particular section that they have language difficulties as you describe these small classes in these special programs

Speaker 3 00:19:08.480
Obviously this sets up to a considerable amount of money is where our costs come in

Speaker 6 00:19:12.140
And this raises another question about the efficacy of the public education system as to whether we are in fact spending enough money in public education or whether we are in fact doing the type of things in public education in the high schools and in junior high schools that would at least minimize some of these problems Because as I interpret what you're saying a number of these young people and older people for that matter come in to at least be through college with serious reading and mathematics problems To me this seems to be a direct reflection of what might have happened in public education Let's say all the way from kindergarten through the 12th grade and now the state the city is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to try to correct problems that were created earlier that might have been avoided if they had organized the public sector and spent more money in the public sector in this direction

Speaker 5 00:20:18.140
How do you as a person who's incumbents or education view this particular analysis I think that the philosophy that I have brought to my particular job is that we cannot continue to point to the public schools are blamed the public schools for not doing the job that is necessary to be done And I feel that we must do the best job at a particular level which we're working I think that there must be cooperation between the public schools and the four year colleges I think in order to cut down my expenses I must make an evaluation of the potential of the youth that I serve as quickly as possible This is a very harsh judgment and I think within the three or four semesters we should make a decision as to the capabilities of this particular group of young people to do college work

Speaker 1 00:21:31.630
Of course you're really just extending the argument that's been made in the high schools that we have decided that after having these youngsters in school for nine years a X group of youngsters are college material and we'll give them all the good instruction and Y group or youngsters or not Now we have a public policy open admissions that anyone who finishes 12 years of school and gets a high school diploma of any type can go to a university which in my opinion is a very positive social development And the question I had asked earlier wasn't one which is to say we're blaming the public schools because it isn't a question of blaming any particular individual but looking at it as a social system that as a social system where a college has to do what normally is done in a junior high school or high school would tend to indicate that something's wrong with the social system by the social system and might be the way in which we teach it might be the kind of teachers we have it might be the kind of expectations we have of students in high school etc.

Speaker 8 00:22:34.540
And as a person who's in competitor education a little bit surprised to hear you say that after two or three years you go three or four semesters you're going to have to make a harsh judgment

Speaker 6 00:22:46.920
You meant it was harsh because it meant that someone wasn't going to be able to stay and someone was going to be able to continue But how does this fit into a philosophy of competitor education a philosophy which at least I hold that everyone can learn and might take some a little longer than others How does this fit into that

Speaker 5 00:23:07.330
Well I think part of the philosophy I recognize that the educational process is a continuum I think that the optimum time to teach reading and the best time for remedial reading would be at the end of the second grade However I also recognize that there's not very much I can do about this and the particular position that I am now I do hope that there will be more cooperative efforts between the public schools and the four year colleges and L.A. they will stop pointing fingers at each other I don't I don't really know that we have a solution for this particular dilemma I it's one that is become a vicious circle particularly for black and Puerto Rican youth

Speaker 1 00:24:07.340
What do you think though that this so-called harsh decision should be made after three or four semesters or do you think that so long as we have opportunities for youth to attend school that so long as they themselves want to put themselves in the position and through the agony if it is agony for the trials and tribulations of trying to gain these educational skills which will enable them to better their lives why in terms of this we also run into an academic bind the student if the student has not made proper progress the student is on probation

Speaker 5 00:24:46.230
Hi you must carry so many hours of credit There are various different procedures that the student runs the file and it ends up in the student becoming disillusioned and dropping out In fact probably one of the biggest problems that we face with this particular group of youth is motivating them and helping them to realize the potential that they have Many of the students that fail do not fail because they do not have the intellectual ability We simply cannot motivate them and develop the interests and the required programming that they may or may not bring to say motivate How is this lack of motivation reflected was reflected in attendance It's reflected in and lackadaisical steady habits And in many ways they simply cannot understand why a particular course or area must be a required part of the program You may have a point sometimes Oh yes I can agree with this

Speaker 8 00:26:05.590
My SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW TO SWALLOW one thing in order to get another thing which reflects on us as educators see so frequently as the expression goes in the streets We blame the victim rather than the system and in a sense a line of questions I've been developing have to do with looking at the system rather than looking at the victim and certainly in your position Your task is to try to help the student On the other hand being part of the system you have to understand how to manipulate the system

Speaker 5 00:26:36.340
Yes I know whenever we talk on this particular topic I remember what a student said in an academic senate At one time in which we as students are paying for a million dollar product and we are allowed to say very little nothing about the product that we are receiving We are not allowed to complain in any way and this is so true Do you allow that in your department Well we Do you realize we have student representation As a result of the student revolution we have students on many committees now they do voice their opinion and they have voting opinions In many many different committees

Speaker 3 00:27:24.310
All right one last question Quick question Do you think that more and more minority and Puerto Rican students will be successful as a result of your efforts

Speaker 5 00:27:33.460
Yes I really do and I'm particularly proud of the fact that they are not going in to the traditional areas of teaching and preaching They are going into all areas and they're expressing interest and I think a great deal of this interest is developing on their own

Speaker 3 00:27:55.660
Also with the help of counselors and the various people at the University Well I think that the young people who listen and the rest of the audience can take some solace from the approach that you're using at Baruch and I'd like to thank you Dr. John Meacham director of content start programs at Baruch College for being our guest on tonight soul of reason
