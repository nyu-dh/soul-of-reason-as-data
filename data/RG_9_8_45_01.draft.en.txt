Speaker 1 00:00:01.390
On September 28 three thousand black and white Americans will descend on the ballroom of the Washington DC Hilton Hotel to attend the fourth annual Congressional Black Caucus dinner This event promises to top all previous CBC efforts

Speaker 2 00:00:17.380
With us tonight on soul of reason are Maureen Broughton coordinator and Cheryl Goggins assistant co-ordinator to discuss this momentous affair whose this is soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time

Speaker 3 00:01:04.69.99999999999272
Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University I'd like to welcome Modine Broughton and Cheryl Goggins of the Congressional Black Caucus DNA coordinating organization to our program tonight to discuss this momentous event in Washington DC on September 28 Glad to have you with us tonight Mo Thank you Glad to have you with us tonight Cheryl Thank you Now this dinner which is well publicized and well known has become an annual event in the black community And possibly Cheryl you could tell our audience what is the significance and importance of the Congressional Black Caucus dinner

Speaker 4 00:01:48.900
Well the Black Caucus dinner is in effect the political affair of the year for black people It brings together black elected officials from all over the country plus our 16 black Congress people And it's just well it is that important I don't think 20 years ago we would have been able to have a dinner like this

Speaker 3 00:02:13.620
All right It is certainly true that it is the black political event of the year And I notice you use the term congress people rather than congressmen and I would tend to suggest that there are congressmen other than men in the caucus Could you tell us who these ladies are and you know a little something about the caucus itself

Speaker 5 00:02:33.690
We have four Congress women We have Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm from Brooklyn New York We all know Shirley We all know Shirley We have Congresswoman Yvonne Braithwaite Burke from Los Angeles California We have Congresswoman Candice Collins from Chicago Illinois

Speaker 6 00:02:51.330
And we have the articulate Congresswoman Barbara Jordan from Texas and anyone who listen to the House Judiciary Committee hearings was really proud to hear Barbara Jordan speak about the Constitution as she did and such articulate sincere and clear terms At the same time to hear our own Congressman Charlie Rangel from New York really give it to them And then John Conyers with his own sardonic wit as he got into the hearing Now the proceeds from this dinner are used for certain purposes by the caucus

Speaker 7 00:03:27.450
What are those purposes

Speaker 5 00:03:29.440
How the proceeds from that dinner used all the proceeds are used to underwrite the research activities and the programs carried on by the CBC staff whose executive director is Dr. Gus at dear The staff investigates or how can I say all this research into different inner city problems and to advise the caucus members themselves as to exactly what the people do need So the money we like to make very clear does not go to the Congress people themselves

Speaker 7 00:04:04.650
It only goes to underwrite the expenses of the staff that they employ and a legislative and research staff is very very important particularly for black congresspeople because unlike so many of the congresspeople from the White Establishment they do not have the physical and the economic resources to hire large research staffs

Speaker 6 00:04:26.310
So in a sense the DNA provides the input for the CBC to organize its legislative and research style And that of course is a very very significant reason for the DNA

Speaker 8 00:04:38.190
But aside from that it's gonna be a lot of fun and a lot of exciting things are going to happen and possibly Modine Modine Broughton who is the coordinator of the dinner organization could tell us something about some of the things are going to happen at Black Caucus weekend which really begins on September 26 this year

Speaker 9 00:04:58.290
Dr. Brown we're planning a concert for the black caucus which will be the first concert they've ever had a benefit concert which will take place in Maryland at Capitol Center on the twenty sixth

Speaker 10 00:05:11.460
Now when you say in Maryland is really just outside of Washington it's just outside of Washington

Speaker 7 00:05:15.940
Let's play Washington hockey team and so on and it's a Poland's a fantastic arena that he's built

Speaker 11 00:05:22.620
That's right I guess most everybody think of it as being in Washington is so close It's only about 10 minutes 15 minutes out of Washington Will be at the onset on that concert We have warm Curtis Mayfield cool and the gang the first choice and the independents

Speaker 8 00:05:42.240
Well those are some of the really top names in the music industry at this time and the concert should go very well And again the proceeds from the concert will be used to help support the activities of the caucus Yes it will And then after the Thursday night concert I believe you have some interesting things planned on Friday

Speaker 9 00:06:03.960
On Friday Dr. Garza dare put together a workshop to take place all day Friday and Friday night We will have a reception for the black elected officials and then the dinner will take place on Saturday at the Washington Hilton Hotel

Speaker 8 00:06:18.740
Now when you say a reception for black elected officials this is for officials from all over the country Yes may be coming to the den and as Cheryl said earlier this does provide a gathering place and a communication time for the many many black elected officials and I believe now we have some 4000 black elected officials throughout the country

Speaker 11 00:06:40.850
Yes we expect about fifteen hundred black elected officials in Washington on that day from all over the country

Speaker 12 00:06:47.570
And on the dinner or at the dinner I believe you have a black man who has become the first mayor of a large southern city He is the honorable Maynard Jackson Atlanta Georgia And he will give the the main address just like Tom Bradley mayor Bradley from Los Angeles who was really the first mayor of a very very large city although Carl Stokes uh had been mayor of Cleveland before to give the address And what about entertainment Is there going to be entertainment at the dinner

Speaker 9 00:07:21.740
A Yes This year we decide to have only one entertainer and that will be Gladys Knight who will close this show

Speaker 12 00:07:29.810
Well Gladys Knight is probably had the largest number of best selling records in the past year

Speaker 9 00:07:34.460
I would say that she is the lady for the year

Speaker 8 00:07:38.000
So you really have a lot of things planned on the weekend

Speaker 7 00:07:40.580
So it looks as though this Black Caucus weekend is both going to be a failure for serious meditation among black politicians and some of their white supporters as well as the many many black supporters in Ohio But in addition there's gonna be a lot of fun Possibly you could tell our audience just how they may make arrangements to attend the dinner over the weekend if they would like to Because this is something is generally done by invitation to possibly there may be some people who the Congress people have missed in terms of the invitations who might want to participate in this weekend I headquarters no here in New York is 2 1 2 7 8 7 0 5 8 3 that's New York City's number 2 1 2 7 8 7 0 5 8 3 and I believe the address of your office is one Lincoln Plaza right or in New York

Speaker 9 00:08:39.880
All right And I wash it in number would be 2 0 2 2 2 5 1 6 9 1 8 2 0 2 2 6 5 2 2

Speaker 7 00:08:51.350
Let's have the Washington number

Speaker 9 00:08:52.730
Why should a number is area code 2 0 2 2 2 5 1 6 9 1

Speaker 7 00:08:59.300
I think it's those important numbers to get because as usually happens at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner there's a rush toward that last day That last week for many many people who want to attend and I understand you have several corporations that have decided to participate Many outstanding people in both the political field and the entertainment field who are going to participate in the Congressional Black Caucus weekend

Speaker 9 00:09:26.220
All right Yes we have Um I would say three quarters of the dinner is really supported by major corporations

Speaker 13 00:09:33.170
That's really fantastic Now of course that's very interesting pass me show you might want to reflect on this and that is why do you think you've gotten so much support from the corporations do you think they're sort of buying off the black community or do they realize that it's a very valid thing for corporations to do to support blacks as they move into the political arena

Speaker 4 00:09:52.250
Well personally I feel a little bit of both I think that there are a lot of corporations that do feel that it's time for them to support and time for them to help blacks become important in the mainstay of American political life

Speaker 14 00:10:06.710
And I also feel there are a lot of corporations who feel that they have to contribute in order to keep the black community off their back shall we say in other words in order to have a positive image right in the black community right

Speaker 5 00:10:20.720
And last year's dinner was such a success that I feel a lot of companies this year have decided that it's time for them to get on the bandwagon So they're coming in this year very strong

Speaker 15 00:10:30.380
I think that's really fantastic Of course it really does attest to the political power of blacks because it is fairly well known that blacks do hold the balance of power and practically all of urban communities and in nationwide elections they have a lot to do with whether or not a national candidate gets elected right That's particularly true in terms of President We hope that we will be hearing from Congressman Walter Fauntroy who is the congressman from the District of Columbia He sits in the Congress unfortunately according to the Constitution he doesn't vote at the present time but I think that's going to be remedied pretty soon He is the person from the Caucus who is the chairman for the DNA and we hope that we will be able to get a call into him so that he can talk with us about some of the perceptions of the Congress people themselves about the dinner Now it's interesting as I understand it that the dinner is organized around a series of committees and they are entertainment committees and planning committees and arrangement committees and things of this type

Speaker 13 00:11:38.390
And let us begin with the Chairpersons for the dinner itself Who are the Chairpersons for the Congressional Black Caucus dinner this year

Speaker 9 00:11:47.240
Aretha Franklin Lady Soul is one of our chairperson Morris lady president of roulette brackets

Speaker 16 00:11:55.460
We have Reverend Leon Sullivan president of LSC and then we have Ted Keel who is well known for his work in arbitration and in many causes related to humanity and improvement of conditions for blacks And it's very interesting that you have a balance in this and you have a black chairperson Jack White chairperson and you have women you have people from the clergy people from the entertainment industry and this does reflect the type of bread that I believe the caucus itself is trying to project And I think we can again note with pride the efforts of our own Congressman Charlie Rangel of New York and providing a great deal of the energy for just keeping the caucus moving of course this year being the year of Watergate has been a time when everyone really should have been tuned in on a political establishment And I think the black caucus people particularly with Congress a woman Jordan and Congressman Rangel and Conyers did more than their share in terms of helping to rid us of this particular scored in terms of the plans for the dinner itself

Speaker 15 00:13:12.590
Do the Congress people really get directly into that or is that something that Modine enterprises does Is that really the job that Maureen Broughton and Cheryl Goggins has to do This is an interesting thing sort of behind the scenes behind the dinner

Speaker 14 00:13:26.990
Well the only Congress people that we really deal with on a day to day level would be Congressman Fauntroy who is the chairman for the caucus itself Congressman Rangel who is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and at times Congressman Andrew Young from Georgia who is the treasurer of the Congressional Black Caucus the other Congress people Congress members we do not actually see or talked to until the dinner

Speaker 10 00:13:57.050
Well of course they will all be there and it will give their constituents a chance to see them

Speaker 17 00:14:02.300
I believe we have Congressman Fauntroy on the phone right now I Walter This is Roscoe Brown from soul of reason in New York Hello How are you Fine and I'm sitting with two charming ladies whom you know a Modine and Cheryl Wonderful We are talking about the caucus dinner and we had already introduced you to our audience by indicating that you are the representative from the District of Columbia And one of these days when I get the constitution straight so that not only will you sit in the House of Representatives but you'll also vote wonderful

Speaker 13 00:14:32.270
And I know you can say right onto that going forward that we would really talking about the progress on the DNA for this year as the chairman for the caucus for the DNA possibly you could tell our audience just how you perceive things are going with the DNA and what an outstanding weekend you expect this Congressional Black Caucus weekend to be

Speaker 18 00:14:54.650
We look forward to this year's DNA being of course the best ever with a well attended annual dinner on Saturday September the 28 and 30 and we'll tell you that the tickets are moving well and we're looking forward to a gathering of large numbers of supporters of the Congressional Black Caucus from around the country for 340 days of activity

Speaker 19 00:15:25.490
Now one of the outlined it for you

Speaker 13 00:15:27.680
Yes you did outline them and one of the things that I was going to ask you about is the political significance obviously this weekend is going to have tremendous social significance because you know whenever the brothers and sisters get together things really happen But because this has been a very significant year in politics with Watergate and things associated with it What do you perceive to be the political significance of these folks coming together for the Congressional Black Caucus weekend

Speaker 18 00:15:52.910
I think it's a great significant and grabs is symbolized by the theme that will be the subject of the all day workshop and that theme is black legislative priorities for 1975 1974 brings hopefully to a close a period in our struggle for freedom and human dignity Where the caucus and black people generally were on the defensive legislatively namely we were fighting to try to preserve and maintain the advances we have made in the 60s in which advances were under challenge by this Nixon administration with the prospect of a now greater leverage on the members of the Congress as a result of greater black registration throughout the South in particular and the prospect of new legislation to deal with the problems of inflation This annual dinner an annual gathering will hopefully be easy Launching pad for serious consideration of new legislative initiatives that we can in fact realize in the night before Congress

Speaker 13 00:17:17.030
I think it's the kind of thing black people looking forward to and I think that white America is aware of the fact that the black Congress people have a lot to do with what happens in this country And speaking of that we know the funds from the DNA are used to support the activities of the Congressional Black Caucus staff Briefly could you indicate to us a couple of those activities so that the audience can really be aware of what the Congressional Black Caucus staff does in trying to fulfill these legislative priorities

Speaker 18 00:17:46.820
Well first and most important the caucus staff does research for members of the caucus on the legislation which comes before forest so that we recognize and act upon the implications of legislative proposals Before I was a representative for the black people of the country and not just blacks but the other minorities and disadvantaged people throughout the land that is a very valuable service and one which equips all of us better to represent the interests of the people in the Congress of the United States And as we were saying earlier and and equally as important is the assistance with the states gives us in maximizing the influence of the black vote on national legislation You know we are only 16 members of a 435 member body but there are about 86 members of the Congress who are white and who depend upon the margin of votes that black voters give them in their district for their successful candidacies And we are working with our staff are able to see to it that those congressmen are apprised of our desire for support of the legislation which we collectively feel is in the best interest of the black and other minorities

Speaker 13 00:19:28.880
And as we were saying earlier in the program before we placed a call to you black Congress people do not have the many many physical and fiscal resources to depend on as some of the congresspeople who are elected with support of industries and groups of this type And so it's very very important that they get the type of grassroots economic support that is provided through the DNA in order to conduct these type of legislative and research services

Speaker 18 00:19:56.930
There's no question about that We're we desperately need to provide an economic base of support for our progress that is independent of other interests in the in the Congress and in the nation as we used to say in a movement of the 60s Freedom ain't free And he who pays the piper calls to see if the black politicians have to depend upon Funds from outside the black community to sustain them in their political efforts then those those sources are going to make demands on us And the best way to free our politicians to do the people's business not that of the moneyed special interests is to support them with the grassroots contributions So that is one of the instructive examples we think we establish in promoting the annual dinner

Speaker 17 00:21:05.120
I think that's a beautiful way in which to summarize I call because that really says very loud and clearly why we need the DNA and what's going to happen as a result of it And in addition as we all know we're going to have a really really good time in Washington I'll see you in Washington Congressman Walter Fauntroy glad to talk with you tonight

Speaker 18 00:21:23.030
Thank you In regards to smoking a cigar a fine job in the court and in this forum

Speaker 16 00:21:28.780
Oh that's beautiful Okay Good night Okay That was very interesting talking to the congressman about just how he perceives it from his end in Washington because through Modine enterprise as we were saying promoting Broughton and Cheryl Goggins are putting the dinner together but uh it does have to tie in very closely with the activities of the Congress people themselves possibly Modine You could tell us uh about some of the other people other than the uh dinner chairpersons who have participated uh from the black and the White community and uh getting this dinner organized by Roscoe

Speaker 9 00:22:12.620
We've worked very closely with the planning committee and I believe Dr. Brown you're on that planning committee Oh we have uh I would say really without the planning committee and the entertainment committee and the Chairpersons we could not pull that dinner off without these people really helping us And I'd like to name some of the people that are involved in our planning committee and and Mike to say that Maurice Leavy president of Roulette Records has done a beautiful job And uh Clarence Avon on the coast Uh President obsessive records We have chairman of the entertainment committee Nathan Mackellar He's really worked very hard And our last year's co-ordinator Harold Simms who this year is working just as hard as last year We have had our chairman um Harvey Russell who worked with us last year and also working on the planning committee this year So we just had our fight

Speaker 16 00:23:16.700
Harvey was on our show last year talking about the significance of the dinner And as you say he's stuck with the planning committee and helping to pull this together In addition I believe you've sponsored several press parties press receptions to alert the press both to the dinner and to the needs and priorities of the caucus

Speaker 9 00:23:38.450
Yes we had a press party in Washington D.C. sponsored by Roulette Records We had a press party in Atlanta that was underwritten by Curtis Mayfield our New York press party was underwritten by chest Janis records and we have a VIP reception at the concert the night of the concert that's underwritten by CRT records out of Atlanta Georgia

Speaker 16 00:24:04.040
Well you really have a tremendous involvement of people as I said in the black and the white community

Speaker 20 00:24:10.360
Um possibly Cheryl you might want to reflect on the philosophical significance of so many black people and their white compatriots from a variety of fields joining around the caucus and the Caucus dinner Do you think this is because they see the crucial role the caucus plays or do you feel that it's because it's sort of a commitment of the black community or is the older it sort of or they are rewarding the caucus for a job well done or do you think it's alerting them to the fact that we in the black community expect them to do more Do you see it as one of these things or all of these things or some of these things

Speaker 14 00:24:55.100
Well from talking to the people that call in asking information about tickets or whatever information they ask about regarding the weekend I feel that's a little bit of everything including people coming just to see Gladys Knight and the Pips That's very you know I really do find that there are some people who are truly truly behind the caucus and behind what they're doing I find there are people who feel that this is the social event of the year and that for their social status they have to say they had been at the Caucus dinner and paid one hundred dollars a plate

Speaker 16 00:25:31.540
By the way it is 100 dollars a ticket although I believe you do receive contributions from some of the folks who want to support the caucus activities but cannot and then right

Speaker 14 00:25:41.360
We receive quite a few contributions from people who can not afford one hundred dollars Who do send in five and 10 and 15 and 25 dollars which we need in which we asked for them to please keep sending it in It's as important as the hundred dollars and we find there People come to the caucus dinner for just about every reason you can name including just coming to see who's there or just coming to say well I was next to Maynard Jackson or I stood next to Congressman John Conyers or I shook hands with Aretha Franklin or asked Gladys Knight and the Pips perform

Speaker 21 00:26:15.180
I think they come for just about everything on a philosophical level though

Speaker 20 00:26:21.990
Some of us would like to think that the fact that black people can coalesce around a group of people whom they may not always agree with tends to suggest an increasing political sophistication that you don't necessarily have to agree with every one of someone on every thing in order to become a part of a group And I think even though you point up the attraction of Gladys Knight which is certainly a fantastic attraction I think there is a kind of coming togetherness around the people in the black community recognize that political action is where it's at and political action takes money and it takes effort

Speaker 14 00:27:01.860
Oh I feel that black people are exceptionally proud of their congressmen and congresswomen You know I really do I think the people in Chicago are just as proud of med camp and Collins excuse me for people who don't know who med camp is it's Congressman Ralph Metcalf and Congresswoman Curtis Collins as we are here in New York of Congressman Charles Rangel and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm

Speaker 16 00:27:23.610
I feel very proud of their Congress people and I think it does reflect this type of thing you're talking about about the desire to be involved possibly Modi and you could again tell our audience just how they can get in touch with the caucus DNA so they can make arrangement that they would like to attend

Speaker 9 00:27:41.450
I would like to give you our new york number 2 1 2 7 8 7 0 5 8 3 and Washington The number is 2 0 2 2 2 5 1 6 9 1

Speaker 13 00:27:54.810
