Speaker 1 00:00:01.470
There are approximately 7000 black physicians and 35 hundred black medical students in the United States The ratio of black physicians to the total black population in most communities is far below the ratio for the nation as a whole What is being done to attract more blacks into medicine here Dr. Howard Brown medical director of the New York Times and assistant professor of clinical medicine at New York University discussed this important issue on tonight's soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:47.810
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:01:15.290
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Dr. Howard Brown no relation medical director and at times an assistant professor of clinical medicine at New York University Glad to have you with us tonight Howard Thank you You're ASCO we do get confused Hikmet through his wife mentioned no relation We were talking about the number of black physicians in the United States and the relationship of this to the need for black physicians First of all I believe there are approximately 7000 black physicians and the number is not really increasing very much because even though some eight or nine hundred graduate each year they are replacing those who retire because apparently going back in history when Howard University in Washington D.C. and Maharishi Medical College in Nashville Tennessee were the main places where black physicians were trained a significant number were trained and now a significant number are retiring as well

Speaker 1 00:02:10.130
So what about the story What is really the situation Are there enough black physicians What's being done to try to get more

Speaker 4 00:02:18.960
I think to discuss the story in its perspective you really have to go back to 1968 The unfortunate incident in April 4th of 68 when the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated at that time if you looked at the minority enrollment in medical schools it was an appalling 854 And many schools throughout the country began to look at this figure 854 54 students black students total held all four year total in all four years in the one hundred and four odd medical schools that was available at that time Now we have 114 medical schools and the numbers that have increased are significant We now have a total enrollment of about 4500 students However I might point out that the number of total medical students enrolled in this period from 1968 to 1976 also increased a good 200 percent

Speaker 1 00:03:20.240
But the percentage Now we talk about somewhere around 30 500 to 4000 black medical students If the percentage in relationship to the 50 some odd thousand does show an increase there is an increase of about 3 of Yes 3 or 4 fall in the number of black medical students Yes there is

Speaker 5 00:03:42.110
However if you look at the total percentage of medical or black medical students or minority medical students as compared to majority medical students it still is an appalling 9 percent The total number of minority students and these include the four categories that we're talking about of Afro Americans American Indians mainland Puerto Ricans Chicanos and Chicanos They represent about 9 percent of the total And of that 9 percent blacks represent approximately 85 percent of that total here in the city of course they represent a much higher percentage because minority groups here in the city have basically blacks and mainland Puerto Ricans So if you look at these statistics certainly the percentages of blacks or minority students I'll say in 1968 was about 1 percent the percentage in 1975 76 is 9 percent but it's still a very small percentage that really is a total relation of a percentage

Speaker 6 00:04:40.970
Well let's talk about the reasons why blacks have not gone into medicine in the past and what's being done today to try to get more blacks into medical school First let me ask Is the barrier essentially a financial one or an academic one

Speaker 7 00:04:56.300
It is both You have to say it's both finances certainly play an overriding factor because if you look at the educational opportunities for minority students finances play an extremely important role We're very concerned about the situation with public education in the city of New York especially in the undergraduate education in City University and also in the public school system in our high schools and elementary school And certainly if you consider what one has to do to get into medical school one really has to start thinking about getting into medical school in elementary school and even perhaps lower so that if they have difficulties and in the academics in that early stages of development they certainly will have problems later on academically and of course financially the financial aspect to this is is pervasive throughout the entire educational system If you look again I know you have an important question answer but if you look at the numbers of students presently being enrolled in medical school regardless of color most of these students seem to be coming from the private institutions which mean that these are students who have money So this this is becoming an important factor in terms of limiting the numbers of students who do not have the financial capabilities

Speaker 6 00:06:18.580
Well let's backtrack a little Well I think you've very eloquently pointed out the fact that there has been an increase and there needs to be an increase in number of black medical students yet at the same time you suggest that there are significant academic problems that blacks students face in terms of getting into medical school as well as significant financial problems Now if we follow this logic to its end result we really won't increase the number of black medical students and eventually black physicians and to any appreciable degree in the near future Yes I understand there's a tremendous drive on both in the black medical fraternity and also in the political arena to get more blacks as physicians to help improve the ratio of physicians who are serving the black people not that white physicians can't serve black people But the fact is that the ratio is still very low in those black and other minority communities So how do we get out of that trap

Speaker 5 00:07:24.070
Yes the ratio is very low and there are very there's some disturbing features that are developing as a result of the financial squeeze that most medical schools find themselves in On the one hand we hear the rhetoric from Washington indicating that yes there is a need to to increase minority enrollment Washington certainly realizes what is necessary to increase minority enrollment And yet if you look at the support the financial support that federal as well as state governments are giving to education to higher education and graduate education it is decreasing There are various federal programs that will be decreasing either this year or the end of next year The federal health professionals scholarship program was decreased by one half in 1975 and will be discontinued in 76 The health manpower act presumably was going to end in June of 76 however there is legislation or the police there's lobbying afoot to make sure that the health manpower act capitation grant which which allows fifteen hundred dollars to a medical school for every enrollee that had planned to decrypt to in June of 76 But perhaps that may not If you look at some of the federal guaranteed student loan programs awarded by banks these have not been utilized as much as possible because the banks have not been granting these particular guaranteed student loan funds There's also a federal health professions loan scholarship fund which has decreased to the amount now of 10 to 15 pounds million whereas before that it had been supported in much higher forms

Speaker 1 00:09:07.550
Let's look at this is this decrease based on some assessment that really the total number of physicians in the nation are too many As a matter of redistribution I know I've heard some people in the profession say that all federal aid should be tied to some type of commitment to serve in underserved areas of the nation Is it really a question of adequate distribution or is it a question of numbers or is it both

Speaker 8 00:09:36.550
Well it's a question of both There certainly is a problem of mail distribution Presently our medical system is one of a non socialistic type one That's the free print free enterprise type system where individuals can a can't are able to go wherever they feel it's necessary for them to go based not on the needs of the community at large but perhaps based on their own financial needs and own financial and other interests There is however foot giving students who require financial aid restricted funds indicating that these students will have to serve in areas that the government designates as being areas that have a low percentage of positions or professionals in that area However the objection to that is this that there are many students who who now do not have the option of other students So again they are put into a different category of fish They are put into a category went because of their disadvantaged financial situation They now are going to have to be placed in a category where they will have to go where someone tells them to go to the mat be in the so-called free enterprise system as other majority students are

Speaker 1 00:10:54.310
Well in a sense if we're talking about the service of the black community I think that it is necessary for something to be done to get more black and others positions to serve the black community Well let's talk about some of the programs that have been developed to attract blacks into Madison

Speaker 9 00:11:12.540
Would you tell us about some of those yes I can speak certainly about what we're doing at NYU I do know something about what's being done in other schools

Speaker 8 00:11:23.160
Again most of these activities developed after 1968 where there was a need to recruit minority students These minority students were recruited in some instances the recruitment commitment was not coupled with a retention commitment so that the students were brought into the medical schools were inadequately prepared and were not supported either adequately financially or adequately academically And the attrition rate for these students certainly increased increased over the overall attrition rate So that what needed to be done by most medical schools was in addition to having a recruitment program they needed to have a retention program And in the case of several schools they they began tutorials and retention type programs and here again you created a second type of citizenship You had the minority students who were put in special remedial programs and they began to feel that they were different from majority students So there you had problems too So we would would hope that in order to best retain students the best thing to do would be to have them academically powerful before they got to medical school and this would get over the problem too of of the issue of not having a standard that medicals that black medical students would would be applied to in relation to white medical students in the admissions policy

Speaker 6 00:12:54.910
All right now is there any place where black medical students can apply for financial aid to help them cover this financial burden

Speaker 10 00:13:02.880
Well what we do at NYU is this we try to take the financial burden off of the medical student by doing this once the medical student is accepted as the black medical student minority medical student A letter is sent to that individual indicating that you have been accepted to New York University Medical School and we suggest that you get in touch with us within two weeks after that contact is made The student then calls the financial aid officer and financial aid officer finds out what that medical student needs in terms of financial aid and then gets that financial aid for the medical student So we want to have the medical student not have to go out on his own to get money And what NYU does is that they presently have been supporting their medical students to the tune of about 4000 dollars

Speaker 11 00:13:48.210
Now is there another outside organization such as the national medical fellowships that minority black students can apply to

Speaker 9 00:13:55.050
Yes they can

Speaker 5 00:13:55.860
Now again part of the economic package that NYU puts together for medical students involves federal funds state funds and also private funds and we rely very heavily on the National Medical Foundation to provide matching grants for minority students

Speaker 11 00:14:10.950
Well it would appear that there are a number of opportunities financially at least if the black students really work to identify those sources and work with people like yourself Yes there is I know Howard as we were talking you had indicated some of the financial aid sources for students let's back up a little How does the student get in because before you spend the money have to be qualified you have to be admitted in order to go to school

Speaker 10 00:14:39.480
Yes well student is not have to graduate from college all you have to do is attend an accredited college and take the necessary courses for matriculation into medical school and the necessary courses really at NYU come down to just five courses and you need a year of English You need a year biology or zoology a year physics a year of inorganic chemistry and a year of organic chemistry

Speaker 5 00:15:04.140
And that's all that really required really require at NYU

Speaker 11 00:15:06.990
What about these heavy pro you say NYU I would surmise that there's not too different most of the other major medical schools Yes What about all of these heavy science programs that medical students are encouraged to carry and also what about the fact that supposedly admission in medical school is so competitive now Students really have to have almost straight-A averages particularly near sciences in order to get in

Speaker 8 00:15:29.670
Is this fact a fishing fiction It's partly both Certainly the number of students who need high grades to get into medical school Let me back up a minute There has been a problem in terms of grade point averages Let me back up even more If you look at what is required what a admissions committee looks at in terms of an applicant the things that they look at is this that they look at their grade point averages from medical from college They look at their recommendations They look at their cat scores That is the medical college admissions tests and then they look at their outside curricular activities or extracurricular activities Now looking at grade point averages there has been a probably in terms of so-called grade inflation last for five years Some of the big schools like Yale and others have indicated that the number of students graduating with honors A's and B's has increased progressively over the years This puts a great problem on the admissions committee in terms of evaluating grade point averages So that that does present a problem However this does not this should not indicate to the student or to the applicant that if he is getting A's and B's that that medical school admissions committees are going to look at this disparagingly We would want all of our applicants to to have A's and B's Now this does not indicate however that C's would prevent a student from getting into medical school

Speaker 10 00:16:58.950
The other thing we look at is what else the student is doing besides just studying Now we have a student minority student who is working 20 hours a week and is getting B's and C's we will look at that in terms of the amount of time he has available to study We also must look at it from the point of view that that student is not going to be as academically prepared as some student who is getting A's and B's

Speaker 6 00:17:22.770
But what are you saying then that the standards for admission for minority students aren't quite as high or as stringent as they offer the majority of students Well I'm not saying it in a pejorative or negative fashion I'm just not getting it from a factual point of view

Speaker 12 00:17:37.560
Yes What we've done at NYU is to create a an executive admissions committee and we broke that down into various into three admissions committee one at one part of the executive admissions committee deals predominantly with minority students and the older students and other students who in some way are disadvantaged

Speaker 8 00:17:55.740
And we look at these applicants in a slightly different way than the majority applicant And we have to because their experiences have been different

Speaker 12 00:18:05.430
And we do take into account working individuals we do take into account barriers that had been placed in front of students prior to 1968 so that we're also looking at the older applicant in the same way There are many students who prior to 1968 knowing what these statistics were did not apply to medical school because they assumed that they just couldn't get in And then we started going out and trying to recruit some of these students some of these very intelligent students who were doing something else and perhaps always wanted to go into medicine so that we would look at their applications in the same light again If you look at an applicant and wonder what can what is considered to be a good applicant we have to look at their aptitude their intelligence their general character and their motivation or what percent of your minority applicants usually get admitted to the percent

Speaker 13 00:18:59.460
Well there are two parts to that

Speaker 12 00:19:02.730
One is the numbers accepted and then the other is the numbers admitted Usually we accept presently about 30 minority students and usually matriculate about 10 out of a applicant pool of about Well I'm not sure about the applicant pool but if you look at the general applicant pool the numbers of applicants the ratio of applicants to matriculate is roughly three to one I say

Speaker 6 00:19:31.920
So that does mean that they might minority student has a fairly decent chance of getting in if he has or she has done fairly well in their schoolwork and also has carried some significant extra curricular or family responsibility Now what about black women Is there a tendency to attract more black women into medicine or are black women much like white women in the past somewhat discriminated against I understand that now approximately 20 percent of the medical students who were accepted in last year's freshman class were women which means that at least there is some movement as far as white women can say to break the stereotype in terms of medicine being a male profession What about black women

Speaker 10 00:20:19.440
Yes I would agree with your discussion of women as a whole Actually the figure is even higher if you look at the admissions of the first year class 75 76

Speaker 12 00:20:30.240
The percentage of women being admitted is about 35 percent The percentage of the ratio of women applicants to women matriculate is again about three to one

Speaker 8 00:20:41.730
So that the percentage of women as a whole is about the same as the percentage of the overall applicant So that that indicates that there is no affirmative action program for women

Speaker 6 00:20:50.220
But again there's no discrimination when you say is no affirmative action You mean there's no attempt to get even more women That's right That's correct Although this 35 percent of that is the figure for this particular freshman class I was saying about the overall medical population I mean that is far higher than it has ever been Oh yes And so therefore that means there must have been some affirmative action and generating more application Well let's talk about the minority student a black student after he or she gets to medical school He's gotten them admit it gotten financial aid for them What about academic support because that seems to be a key factor What about the academic support and what about the type of training that they have because so frequently it's alleged that black students go into professions and they become alienated from the community and the people that they're supposed to serve So we have to question want to deal with academic support and the type of experiences that they have which attempt to relate them to the minority community

Speaker 12 00:21:48.340
Here again academic support is similar to recruitment where each individual college has done their own thing

Speaker 10 00:21:54.970
At NYU what we did there is that we did not have a a tutorial program for all black students who needed help

Speaker 7 00:22:03.340
But what happened is that each department head or each department was then responsible for those students who were having trouble in their particular department to give them whatever help they they could

Speaker 8 00:22:15.460
This has worked fairly well at NYU or attrition rate at NYU has not been great The overall attrition rate for all medical schools had increased after the numbers of minority students began to increase But here again I think that overall the attrition rate is not that bad

Speaker 11 00:22:34.870
Your second question has to do with developing experiences for minority group students to keep them from becoming alienated from their own people from their own communities

Speaker 6 00:22:46.990
I know that's a tough one That is a tough one The medical curriculums basically as I understand it are more oriented to preparing research specialists than the art of preparing practitioners anyway although I understand there's a new area of family medicine that is developed and more and more people are beginning to be interested in that

Speaker 12 00:23:04.540
Yes and here again this this reflects the government policy the government is now interested in providing family practitioners providing practitioners as we talked to before in under the end it is very rare right So that because of this particular emphasis on the part of government the medical schools are taking their lead and they are providing more family type experience to medical students as well as postgraduate medical students in terms of alienation It's somewhat difficult to talk in terms of alienation it would depend on the experiences that the student brings to medical school

Speaker 8 00:23:43.300
If the student comes in having been involved with the community having been involved in a lot of curricular activities or extracurricular activities that related to people related to other minorities related to helping other minorities they all minorities

Speaker 9 00:24:01.750
Those individuals would through medical school would continue to to have that same kind of approach to the practice of medicine into postgraduate training

Speaker 8 00:24:13.450
However if you had an individual who came in medical school who did not have this prior experience the medical school curriculum would not generate that sort of thing it would not generate the need for the individual to go out into the community and do other than the practice of medicine

Speaker 1 00:24:30.280
I know this is asking you to criticize your own profession but as a layman in my case it would appear to me that this is definitely one of the things that medical curriculum should do is to develop insights among physicians so that they will be able to serve people better I do know that there is this emphasis on research and I certainly wholeheartedly support the emphasis on research But all medical education or even most doesn't have to be orient toward research at least as I view it What's your opinion on that

Speaker 9 00:24:59.440
Well I think that it would be hard to say that the medical school curriculum has to provide this opportunity However what should provide this opportunity is the organizations of physicians like the National Medical Association which is an organization predominantly of black physicians These student National Medical Association which is a organization organization predominantly of black medical students who are an affiliate of the professional the National Medical Association have been very instrumental in organizing medical students into political action into social action into the things that you're talking about and I think that they have been very instrumental in in establishing programs for example at NYU we have a young man who is the president of that organization Larry Brown

Speaker 12 00:25:48.670
Again no relationship

Speaker 10 00:25:50.500
He has organized some very excellent programs careers and in medicine careers in the health field where he has been instrumental in getting high school students and college students to seminars that have been sponsored by his organization

Speaker 1 00:26:04.480
And I think this is very helpful I think it is I was really dealing with something more basic There is a considerable need for medical service in a minority community in the poor community There are ways of approaching patients that you the medical doctors come in contact with in clinics as some awareness of their particular medical problems as well as social problem I know NYU and Bellevue and some of the other hospitals have excellent clinic programs but there is also this whole new area of outreach of the community family care centers out in the communities and somehow or another It's my impression that the medical curricula do not provide enough opportunities for prospective physicians to even just learn how to treat patients and not only treat them medically I mean treat them as people that that's very true

Speaker 12 00:26:52.950
And I can't argue with that and I must say that it may be sporadic in terms of the the university or the institution attempting to deal with this But as an established policy it is not being taught or fostered And I must say that this is a failing on the part of the university is failing on the part of most big institutions

Speaker 1 00:27:14.770
And of course this is not only applies to massive blast education and social work a lot of other professions but I think it's important for us to continue to keep this in front of us now as we come toward the close of the program Could you give us some opinion as to whether you think the black medical students are now being trained in our medical schools and quite honestly most of them are not now being trained in a predominately black medical school Do you think they'll go back to their communities and you think they'll really provide service or will they go into this money rat race that so many physicians go into and I know that's a tough question

Speaker 10 00:27:47.260
Yes it is But I think that the answer to that again is going to have to be the government's lead I think if the government is going to take money out of the community and wipe out the areas that they have been supporting in terms of community health services and this sort of thing it's going to be difficult for medical students to organize community health services It's going to be difficult for the community without money to to organize these health services So I think it goes back again to the federal government and I think what medical students as well as all other students should do is to try and lobby in the federal government to try and help and make sure that that priorities are really addressed by the federal government and that things that we think that should be done is done

Speaker 3 00:28:32.200
Our guest on a night celebration reason has been Dr. Howard Brown is medical director of the New York Times an assistant professor of clinical medicine at New York University and we've been talking about the need and ways of meeting the need for more black physicians
