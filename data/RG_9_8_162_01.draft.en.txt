Speaker 1 00:00:22.630
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University's

Speaker 2 00:00:49.680
On Sunday night April 17th at Carnegie Hall Two of America's greatest jazz pianist Cecil Taylor and Mary Lou Williams will present a concert embraced on tonight soul of reason Mary Lou Williams and Peter O'Brien we'll be talking with me about this concert and what it means for American music And Mary and Peter will be glad to have you both here tonight Thank you Happy to be here This is really quite a thrill for me because Mary Lou Williams is one of my great heroes in the field of jazz and Cecil Taylor who's been on the program with us in the past is really quite a creative genius and you put these two people together Peter really must be something

Speaker 3 00:01:36.240
How did that come about and what are you trying to do in particular this idea of embraced

Speaker 4 00:01:40.710
Well it was Mary Lou's idea to the way it actually came about Cecil Taylor would come into the cookery in New York Three four five times a week when Mary was playing there One night Mary Lou said she said let's do a concert together and he said fine That's Cecil's title The title embraced He contributed that But the important thing to realize is that when we say playing together that's what we mean to pianos onstage duets all night long all new music for handed piano not Mary first and Cecil second

Speaker 5 00:02:17.520
So this is what's unique about the concert it's a it's a new fresh and very different One man said no one before of Mary's stature and experience has ever embraced the avant garde

Speaker 3 00:02:33.870
Is that really true and that's really what is exciting to me I've heard the full tale of play it has We joke with Cecil about when he finishes there won't be anything but this the rumble of the piano because he take you literally acts the piano and to bring a you know a legendary figure like Mary together would you say we have our god or something Oh Mary attacks the parent of two very strong strong pianists so

Speaker 4 00:03:03.270
And most likely it will be just the two pianos on stage all night long Going from Mary has a phrase exploring the history of jazz with love The whole history of the music

Speaker 6 00:03:17.190
Well that's what it's really all about And Cecil happens to be my giant of the avant garde because I like originality in playing And it's very exciting and inspiring to me to play with him And we've rehearsed and we've run run over a couple of things you know just playing and I felt really great because He gives you food for thought and play and that's what jazz is Usually while you play and you may play something that you if you if you were recording you'd have to take it from the record and practice like you with the classic you know So it's a really a great experience for me and then to count on to everything that's being played

Speaker 2 00:04:05.130
You know where you are Was that's really part of your genius But this idea of exploring a particular set of ideas you know musical ideas with someone else I can say you know we do some classic so-called classical music because far as I'm saying jazz is classical music but we do this in the so-called classical music where you put two pianos up and two people get up and attack the piano as it were too often in the field of jazz

Speaker 7 00:04:36.930
We accept and sometimes a jam session whatever we do we get the planned opportunity for people to sit down and play together

Speaker 4 00:04:45.960
And as Peter says to play with each other rather than if they have two names on a bill one after the other right it'll be you know there'll be a section dealing with the spirituals or section dealing with the blues all new music CO composed by Mary Lou Williams and Cecil Taylor together But it'll be that simultaneous point of view of the two of them Well I'm quite positive feeling what that musical be it'll be something different a who I don't really know I heard one section I went to a studio in Carnegie Hall one night when Mary and Cecil were rehearsing and working and I heard a little section of ragtime that was incredible But it is not like anything that was written before it's related to it but it's different

Speaker 2 00:05:33.890
Well let's just listen to some of Mary's work This is a original piece by Mary It was recorded live at the cookery down in the village where she played so many engagements and you get the feeling of the audience and you also get the feeling of what Mary herself is doing in some of the newer music And then we can just sort of put Cecil on top of that This particular number is called Blues repeat now that you know see what you did Mary Mary as I was listening to this

Speaker 8 00:08:07.090
And to pick up the depth of the base Yes you're feeling one of the things that I was wondering is is this the type of thing that you and Cecil are going to be doing is this particular piece going to be a piece that's played or is really going to be totally new music

Speaker 6 00:08:23.150
Yeah it's totally new New music it'll be something on this order but quite different then than what you've heard and will probably play in spirit as ragtime Kansas City swing and the history of jazz and everything but probably have maybe some authentic things going on but everything new everything new

Speaker 8 00:08:47.720
Now what about this title embraced What was this What does that really mean

Speaker 9 00:08:52.510
Is it raising a piano again in each other that's allowed

Speaker 6 00:08:57.700
It's between the two of us and that's a part of it And that's what has been missing for quite a while You know musicians getting together in love you know because that's really what the music is You play love from the stand and it reaches the hearts of the people I used to say to them to listen with the ears of their hearts and they'll feel this great love and the healing that's in jazz that has practically disappeared

Speaker 10 00:09:27.940
You know we have talked about this before and you've been on soul of reason Mary but one of the things that I really wonder about is as we go more and more into the record business more and more and the studios and more and more and the various ways of amplifying music and mixing them on a machine I get a feeling that we lose a lot of the Spirit meaning the feeling of joy you get the beat because that's the hit those amplifiers do it

Speaker 8 00:09:58.120
That will give you a beat But in terms of the feeling to the music and for example and blues repeater you could get a feeling that you retire But you really hear the music whereas when you get into other kinds of music not that it doesn't give you a feeling as a person but does a musician lose some of his or her musicianship as he gets into that newer type of amplified music

Speaker 6 00:10:23.410
Well I don't think any musician even a great our great chance really able to play all that they do really play because you have to wait for this signal to start and quite a few things it freezes one waiting sitting there waiting And I know what happens to me I'm trying not to make a mistake Being a musician So that may take me out to see what we'll do on at Carnegie Hall on April 17th two is that Mary prefers a Baldwin one because it has a kind of a mellow

Speaker 5 00:10:57.160
Texture the sound is mellow from the instrument itself And as far as amplification is concerned in the hall it'll be What I call Live on a live sound on Mike In other words easy to hear but not loud so that you hear with perfect clarity and perfect all the nuances also on a electric piano you can't get me tone any any shade or difference you're recording the amplifier not the instrument or what the man does or the woman does with the fingers

Speaker 10 00:11:27.760
It's a several removed from the heart that really has a lot to say about what is happening to us through our music Most of your commercials much you would television music a good number of your records are done with amplification Are they awesome people like Stevie Wonder who are very very skillful at putting these sounds together to give you a feel while he has his voice to his live voice

Speaker 5 00:11:52.870
Yeah real joy

Speaker 4 00:11:55.130
That's right

Speaker 7 00:11:55.570
His voice is an instrument but when we get into something like the piano that to me the piano is really the instrument that that carries the feeling of jazz I mean we have the saxophone which gives some of the soul and the trumpet which gives them the way But really it's it's that piano that had moves it along

Speaker 2 00:12:17.470
So as you sit down and I know you don't do just sit that I'm going to do this with these what I have seen you do and I believe you do in this concert is to as you begin to play and things will begin to play these feelings in this love

Speaker 6 00:12:35.920
Yeah Love create different sounds and different things You never know when something great is going to happen

Speaker 5 00:12:43.260
You know the important thing I think to about Mary is that she's always forward looking It's not that she wants everyone to play in the style of Fats Waller I don't think there's anyone who would have come up with this idea to do a concert or her experience and all the different eras she's changed through to then ask a man like Cecil Taylor let's do a concert together Very forward looking But what she's concerned about is that no matter how complicated or a way out or complex the music becomes that that same feeling stays in there So yes you don't have any difference between Bessie Smith Billie Holiday Duke Mary Lou Monk Cecil Or John Coltrane all different developments or forms of the same thing But the feeling is that is the most important thing the feeling of the blues has to permeate the complexity And I think that's why Cecil's title embraced is so good because that's a worn a tie It means people coming together and playing together and two of them But it's got all that love and which is the really the unique thing about this music and most important effort we know

Speaker 8 00:13:59.620
Mary I had an opportunity to see you and hear you interacting with students at New York University at the institute Afro-American affairs black scholars lecture series And to me it was really fascinating to see you as an older person someone who's really one of the legendary heroes of jazz to interact with the students who were concerned with new music and new sounds and when they heard you play some of the things that you played that went back

Speaker 11 00:14:34.570
Into the 30s and 40s to see their eyes get why it was this what that music was like

Speaker 12 00:14:42.640
And this tells me in a sense that somehow or another those of us who are concerned with the history of jazz and the perpetuation of our music have done a disservice to some of our younger people by not letting them hear it like it really was

Speaker 13 00:14:59.650
Yes because some of those records some of the old Columbia's that as they really were called it so badly that we hear them now they sound scratchy and dull and for you to sit there at the piano and play some of these tunes and feelings of Duke or Billie or lunch or what have you and ze young people just say Well that was good music

Speaker 14 00:15:24.670
Well you see what really happened Most of the young kids teenagers there their favorites were people like coal train and whatnot but they start on the top and that is very dangerous to this great art One has to know all about the past movements and the music you know the very original the spirituals ragtime Kansas City Swing you all and see Coltrane played all that and he knew about it and in order for any musician is striving to be great on his instrument he should go back and learn all these things and how they were played When I have kids then they come to the house students you know for lessons I take them back to Fats Waller I said Don't be impatient now I says because any day any moment you'll be playing avant garde or anything And then about four to six months they're on to it But they must go back to the old music you know you see all that music is absolutely permanent value

Speaker 15 00:16:25.740
Completely That's got nothing to do with 1930s and 1970s it's a permanent value Cecil said about this concert that Mary Lou and I Cecil Taylor will bring everything that we are to this music that night So you know it's it's a great artist just rises above the moment constantly And I think as some young people if they don't hear Fats Waller or monk even by now on the radio on the stations that they listen to or in you know that's the showcases they respect They tend to think of historical and as far more than historical interest it simply is it's almost as if you use an analogy with some other music forms

Speaker 12 00:17:08.319.9999999998836
Chopin Mozart body Brahms neither Oh you don't say that you're playing 17 80s music you play Beethoven's Chopin and one of the things that black people have given to the world is our music

Speaker 16 00:17:25.450
Jazz spirituals are blues and really they are contemporary whether the form which they were written occurred in nineteen hundred or 1876 or 1976 And I think that's a very very good point to develop Now one of the things that you do Mary I think very well is to build on some of the work of some of our greats like Duke Ellington and Daryn when I was a kid I used to go listen to Duke Ellington and one of the songs that I like because that with Johnny Hodges and some of the people was the Jeep is jumping and you did that at the cookery And we have it for our audience tonight That

Speaker 17 00:21:37.110
You really wonder how anybody can sit still

Speaker 18 00:21:40.910
It would still be hearing music like that and you also wonder why it is that the younger people don't get a chance to hear enough music like that I guess part of just the commercialism the record industry And the other part is I guess we forget we really forget what we have done You know always reaching out for new things on the other hand Mary as you and Cecil thought about this idea you coming out bridging a whole range of music What did you think about what it's going to do for the audience We talked about what it does for you

Speaker 12 00:22:24.120
What do you think it's gonna do for the audience

Speaker 14 00:22:26.220
Well I really don't know Well I don't think any musician a performer and really knows what's going to happen but I hope there will being a lot of love to the audience because if we have love you know you know running and playing in our music it'll reach them and I think it'll be terrific

Speaker 19 00:22:43.410
I hope really But you never know And so I think it'll be beautiful And this is going to be on a Sunday night at Carnegie Hall And I imagine the tickets will be available right now fairly moderate prices and

Speaker 12 00:22:57.940
Then they can kind of guess at the box office and through ticket Tron and I see

Speaker 18 00:23:02.970
Well I expect that this will be one of the real top events of the entire 1977 music scene and probably like so many of these things after they have been done

Speaker 12 00:23:18.360
People were talking about it and this was one of the events which leads me to ask a question are you going to record this Yes it'll be recorded in one hour I have a meeting and it should be tied down

Speaker 11 00:23:30.780
Well that's that that I think is it is a plus coming out of it

Speaker 12 00:23:35.220
So the audience will be on the record too

Speaker 18 00:23:37.080
Now when things when concerts like this happen I know that word gets around among your fellow musicians do as musicians make an attempt to get out and as they hear or dig the other musicians when things like this come up do you

Speaker 14 00:23:53.370
I think so I don't know it just what's happening but I've had a few to call the house for tickets and they're anxious to help Dizzy Gillespie I talked with him last night and he's helping because they all realize that it's a great event and it or if it does go off well it will help everyone concerned and even musicians and that we'll be able to get a better sound and bring about Well in other words America really should know about the great art that has been created through the suffering of the French the early slaves and I think it'll help in that direction also

Speaker 13 00:24:29.490
This is true about the arts as well as we help each other and as we make more people aware of what the answer about yes think that our music in this instance and I guess eventually it will help the development of just our general sophistication

Speaker 12 00:24:47.190
And as you say it will actually help the musicians themselves

Speaker 20 00:24:50.050
Yeah I think that's what's especially important about this music above all others You know because it came out of all that experience of black people in America and because jazz people don't like the word jazz or not no one does but for lack of a better word to pinpoint it Jazz musicians above any other artist really work and create from the heart So they play Louis Armstrong played Louis Armstrong and Mary Lou plays Mary Lou and Cecil plays Cecil above any other artist I think this is true of these creative musicians that play themselves and all their experience or their ability is at the service of that they're expressing not only themselves but I think in this case the history of a whole people

Speaker 16 00:25:37.800
Now Mary you work with the new Duke Ellington very well and I know that Duke Ellington through his music

Speaker 13 00:25:47.370
Wanted to tell the story of his people He did it His main instrument was the orchestra Yes Your main instrument is the piano is any real difference in the way in which a composer goes about reflecting his or her feelings through music as when working with an instrument like the piano as against the entire orchestra

Speaker 14 00:26:10.260
Well the difference is that you hear more or less what you have created And I think that's where he was you know when he created something he wanted to hear played by the band and you get a better idea of what you're doing And but I don't think there's too much difference because I create while I'm playing but I'd never get a chance to hear what it would sound like you know not unless I recorded an as I said before you're waiting for the signals to start And I may not be able to do as well but I think that's the reason why a bandleader like Duke Ellington Well at least Duke he wanted to hear what he had created

Speaker 18 00:26:48.170
Well you played with practically every one of the legendary great black bands and some of the legendary great white man's as you think back on this experience Is any one particular band that you played with that you enjoyed working with more than others

Speaker 14 00:27:04.660
Well I enjoyed I didn't play with Duke but I traveled with him six months and arrange things and I enjoyed that very much That was a highlight of my career And I also enjoyed Andy Card because the guys were very patient with me I learned most everything I know through and working the boys because they were born psychiatrists They were born everything and they saw to it that you did exactly what she was supposed to do they would never leave her side and you did it So that was a great experience And through that I was able to arrange for all the bands of the 30s a guess on hand Duke Ellington Earl has Louis Armstrong and the cast along as well I don't think anybody might have heard of them but that was a great band during that period And every band that existed

Speaker 13 00:27:56.260
But my arrangements you know it really must be something it's really beautiful to think about and then to be able to go to Carnegie Hall and sit down with a guy like Cecil Taylor and again get a chance to live out and explore your music and your feeling that really must be a wonderful experience

Speaker 14 00:28:15.100
It is I feel very happy about it

Speaker 12 00:28:17.950
