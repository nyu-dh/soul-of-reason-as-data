Speaker 1 00:00:01.500
Our employment test in government and industry colorblind Many minorities think not here Dr. H.L. white test specialists discuss these topics on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:39.230
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 3 00:00:59.870
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Dr. Herb White director of the executive unit of the wrap program of New York City Department of Personnel and Dr. White as a specialist in testing Glad to have you with us tonight herb Thank you Thank you very much Roscoe Now one of the things that we are interested in and many people in the black community by community is the fact that as more and more people are taking civil service test for example some hundred and fifty thousand I think applied for the sanitation exam and some 70000 took it here recently here in New York City as many more people are taking these test many more minorities and many more minorities are getting civil service jobs There is a great deal of concern in the community about how fair tests are what tests do for people et cetera And since your technical training your doctor's degree is in this field your experience in the New York City department of personnel is in this field I thought it'd be interesting for you to give us some observations about what do you think the implications of increasing numbers of minority people coming into civil service and government work are What are the implications of this for the testing field itself

Speaker 4 00:02:12.170
Well I certainly think that minority groups The concern is very very real There are a number of changes that Have to take place in a number that are taking place

Speaker 3 00:02:28.800
What are some of the changes that need to take place and then tell us a little about some of the things that are actually happening

Speaker 5 00:02:33.650
And then there are 1 1 1 very specific changes taking place is a very very drastic change it's taking place I would say within the last couple of years has been the feeling of minority groups about civil service exams It was impossible to conceive of a hundred of one hundred and sixty thousand people or so applying for the sanitation man exam

Speaker 6 00:03:03.500
As long as three years ago in other words they didn't think they would have a chance of passing

Speaker 5 00:03:07.820
Right And for the police exam forget it I used to head the community liaisons unit at the Department of Personnel and we used to take out to the community as much information on testing as we could We used to work preparing staff of poverty program agencies throughout the five boroughs setting up recruitment efforts and explaining to people what civil service was all about And when it came to the police exam however the added the feeling about the police department was such an extremely negative one And based on the experience that the black community has had over the years in these fields you see that you could not get very many people to go for the police exam

Speaker 7 00:03:57.980
And then of those who took it a very very small number were able to pass the test which in part is a function of the test and in part a function of possibly preparation

Speaker 8 00:04:07.010
These folks had for the test yes I think it's a re it's a reflection both of the kinds of tests that have been traditionally used for so long And also of the of the I would say the educational level the far end of a society which has discriminated so consistently over the past the fact that on the average they hear the the the emphasis in the schools segment a segregated school system the penalty that it's been paid by black people in almost every area of life has carried has brought black people to to the exam situation with a with a different kind of ability than the abilities that the ordinary here a middle class white would bring

Speaker 7 00:04:56.840
Yet yet those very same black people might very would and have performed the job well and of course one of the things that you found it even for middle class people white or black many of the questions that were asked on some of these tests by knowledge of Shakespeare or knowledge of some obscure fact in history really had very little to do I'd have to say practically nothing to do with a job so much so that in the testing field now they're talking about having tests being job related namely that the type of questions that are on the test have some reasonably direct relationship with the job it's going to be performed Now one of your responsibilities now is as director of the executive unit of the rep program which is a program to bring people into the employment mainstream and you have done some very creative things in selecting people for various positions Could you tell us something about the rep program and what your relationships in terms of examinations after this program I should step back a moment

Speaker 9 00:06:01.660
Probably Roscoe and I go into what I've been doing over the last two years

Speaker 4 00:06:10.940
Okay that's good

Speaker 10 00:06:12.280
And then make the chart make the transition into the directly related to how test of trying to become colorblind Yes

Speaker 4 00:06:20.020
And how civil services should be expanded and adapted to the needs of the large numbers of minority group members who are in New York City and it might add to that large numbers of poor whites

Speaker 7 00:06:36.130
They may not be large numbers but they are people from white backgrounds who also have deprived educational backgrounds

Speaker 10 00:06:43.180
Yes every program that is designed is set up so it really is basically and technically colorblind it just so happens that there is such a large model among blacks that Puerto Rican people have Hispanic backgrounds right That it impinges on them And incidentally with regard to Puerto Ricans one of the most interesting things that I found myself involved in was the development of a Spanish language type exam for correction officer and for housing assistance Over the last couple of years that's a perfect example of the civil service system trying to be more responsive

Speaker 8 00:07:24.640
Yes yes the civil service system trying to be more responsive and also an example of the way in which the organizations are exerting pressure upon the civil service system in upon the city to be more responsive

Speaker 3 00:07:37.980
But that's not that is the main reason not that people are necessarily insensitive in government but government does respond to pressures and to the needs of the people when they expressed and

Speaker 11 00:07:49.150
It's a very positive thing

Speaker 4 00:07:52.270
They now say for the last two years I headed a unit at the Department of Personnel handling entry level examinations There's a staff of about 15 people I'm very pleased to say that it was a an integrated staff There were several black examiners there and I was a chief of the unit The real beautiful thing about it for me was the kind of a harmony that the kind of a relationship and report that there was among this particular group of examiners we found during that two years were able to do a a number of things that I feel rather good about although I would have liked to have done much much more

Speaker 11 00:08:52.930
You know the feeling is Yeah right I would like to

Speaker 4 00:08:56.990
I would like to accelerate everything that is everything that would be both of benefit to minority group members and of benefit I'd say to the testing and personnel process We handle that we were able to get out the the housing authority police examination transit patrol police examination We had examinations going almost every two weeks or so and we were able to Come up with a few new approaches to testing which have since been adapted for the police exam

Speaker 7 00:09:37.720
Give an example of one of those new approaches

Speaker 5 00:09:40.150
Well for the Housing Authority police we brought in a a memory a picture memory and observational skills test I suppose that would be the best description of it

Speaker 7 00:09:54.640
In other words much of their work involves or recalling details And the best way to recall details is to do it by memory rather than just having something on a piece of paper that they can look back at and refer to Could you just give an example of what would happen what did they do

Speaker 12 00:10:10.480
Were they shown a picture on a screen and it was taken away from them and then they had to remember details is that the way the first day they had a they had a picture distributed that they looked at for five minutes the picture was taken away from them and they were asked what was in the picture they were given the first the first part of the examination consisted only of that picture And then they went into the regular examination Very interesting thing about the first two pictures is that they were drawn by black artists The experts that as the head of the unit I had to find the people who would develop the pictures and so I got two very well-known black artists They can't reveal their names because it's confidential testing process one One is is a well-known illustrator and the other one who's a is it has an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute

Speaker 13 00:11:17.700
Now this the results on this question are other than the fact it's good to see blacks moving into various technical areas

Speaker 14 00:11:31.840
Was there any particular reason why you wanted the black artists to do this rather than an artist of another background

Speaker 4 00:11:40.150
Because I felt that we wanted to get a scene that was going to be read that the black people would be responsive to it I also felt that there was a validity in developing a picture which is typical of New York and we had a scene that involved It was in a housing authority there The drawing definitely showed black and Puerto Rican people in it and the year the artist was also one of the best artists I know Yeah exactly

Speaker 14 00:12:18.480
Yeah well I can see that that certainly is a good characteristic Regardless whether a person is white black or blue if they're the best in a particular field it's obviously a good reason but another reason it's frequently given for using black artists and dealing with situations in the inner city is that in terms of a replication of physical mannerisms and facial expressions etc. People have had that experience probably would reflect that better in their art than someone who didn't

Speaker 6 00:12:46.450
Oh yeah and I think that's what you were saying You said you wanted it to be reflective of the experience in New York and I think that's one of those little things

Speaker 14 00:12:54.940
It's really a sort of a subtle thing that helps to make test fairer to a wide spectrum of people because even having white people identify black faces if they really have authentic black faces to relate to they can do a better job of identification So up and down the line is better for both both parties and situation

Speaker 4 00:13:14.560
Let me support that with a very good example We When When When I headed the community liaison unit we had a member of the staff was a very good artist Very definitely someone who identifies black now What she had done his head was to set up a picture of a a policeman See and the features were definitely Afro American

Speaker 12 00:13:43.630
And the response of some of the individuals a little higher in the hierarchy was well it doesn't look This might be an ounce or or this might be an insult

Speaker 11 00:13:54.610
You know it's rather random showing authentic black figures made it might possibly Saudi Yeah Which is quite remarkable they chose I think to some extent Well I don't know what I would call that racism or a lack of understanding I got the feeling better wait it today That's about thing

Speaker 12 00:14:11.680
Yeah And the uh the net result of that was that the drawing that we use that we use that our unit was the drawing that this young lady did and not the drawing that was done by the you know the high flown professional artist and we we got a very rather beautiful thing

Speaker 6 00:14:30.810
That's a good diversion but I think it reflects the type of things that are being done by people like yourself to help make test fairer because basically when we talk about tests being fair we don't mean that everybody should pass them with the same grade We're just saying that looking at the range of human abilities that people who are at various points on that range have a fair chance an accurate chance of being assessed And that really is type of thing that you're trying to do right in your programs

Speaker 4 00:15:01.780
Well I feel that the Civil Service Commission is becoming has become more responsive The department of personnel I should say the Civil Service Commission didn't generally general government agencies are becoming more responsive to this need

Speaker 13 00:15:23.260
Last however we give them too many easy bouquets I think it is certainly true that there'd been several court decisions that have Rick wired not only government agencies but also industries to do a better and fairer job of assessment and we going all the way from the range where in some industries blacks just never were even given a chance to take the test over two situations where they were given tests where they were known that they couldn't pass over into situations as you suggest where the tests really weren't directly related to the job

Speaker 14 00:16:00.560
And in response to this businesses and industries and government are attempting to do a better job of assessment And since we are trying to break through some really difficult problems that's where the need for technical specialists like yourself particularly Black Psychologists comes into play

Speaker 12 00:16:20.870
The actions that you mention are initiated by such organizations as the Vulcan Society and the Hispanic Society Vulcan societies and black so like firemen's group right

Speaker 13 00:16:32.300
The Guardians stay by at least one group Right We've had Sergeant Scully on our program one of the officers in the organization

Speaker 5 00:16:40.600
Sergeant Shep is someone that I was with the organization for quite some time I had worked with us quite quite closely in recruiting sometime ago but the actions of these organizations increase the responsiveness and that is a

Speaker 4 00:17:00.980
I think that the organizations should continue to watch the examinations I believe that black people and really all people should be concerned not only just with so special examinations but with the entire testing process There is a larger budget should be put into testing research efforts should be expanded The Department of Personnel and now is an evolved in considering an expansion of its research effort I hope that they'll get the moneys for it and that's a very important thing

Speaker 3 00:17:44.450
Tonight we are talking with Dr. Herb White who is a specialist in testing with the New York City department of personnel He heads the executive unit of the rep program as we are talking about some of these efforts to make it more possible for minorities and other people to move into civil service and government jobs Could you tell us something Herb about the rep program and what some of the creative things that you and your unit have done to screen people more effectively

Speaker 4 00:18:15.140
Well the rep program the role of the department of personnel in the Rep program is purely a personnel function

Speaker 11 00:18:26.030
What is the rep program What are the what are those laughs

Speaker 12 00:18:28.580
That's what I call work relief employment work relief employment program I have to emphasize that relief OK because many people think that it is release and it refers to people who were formerly on welfare And what does the rep program do It takes the money that would ordinarily go to people as welfare payments and uses that money for creating jobs for the same people Where do they get payments at the same time they get not welfare payments they get payments which are equivalent to those that are a regular city job Workers would get in counterpart job titles exact exactly the same pay they get exactly the same pay as Che as changes in salary are negotiated

Speaker 14 00:19:19.400
Why these these raises are given also to wrap employees and eventually I believe the rep employees do take the civil service test for the appropriate jobs and then get a permanent civil service job out of it Is that the ultimate the

Speaker 4 00:19:34.850
Yeah Well the the ultimate is in several different directions to give them as much preparation as possible for coming on to a civil service There are 9000 now placed to give them a job experience which will make it possible for them to move into private industry You see and to have them end up with permanent jobs A The the basic idea in a with work is to assign them to productive and needed jobs so that welfare money which paid for no productive labor before now produces something material and worthwhile because to be fair about it I would say that welfare money that goes to people raising children is for productive purposes

Speaker 15 00:20:30.970
And I think I'm very careful about getting into the anti welfare psychology so freely pervades our society I recognize however the point you're making that there are people who want to work literally very and do not have the skills or have not had the opportunity Which raises the question as you said to assign them to jobs Is this a random assignment or do people get assigned to jobs which in which they have some interest and then in screening for them Do you try to match up their skills with their interest

Speaker 12 00:21:06.740
Well I think that I have to I have to explain this go into this a little bit more of a detail The assignment of of red people is is done through the Department of Social Services The people are referred from the Income Maintenance centers centers to an end to an intake or input Center at the Department of Social Services They are interviewed by case managers there and on the basis of the skills to which with which they come to the job they were assigned to one of 18 different job titles Now those Iranian files titles those 18 titles while they range from fiscal office assistant to Korea to building assistant the range of those titles is not very wide The reason the reason for this is that there is some opposition to the program

Speaker 5 00:22:02.150
There's a lawsuit right now against the program by District Council 37

Speaker 10 00:22:09.080
It's one of the civil service civil service labor unions and this hasn't been resolved

Speaker 5 00:22:15.380
There is the creation of additional titles or titles that may be infringing on city workers has become a very sensitive issue hasn't been resolved

Speaker 4 00:22:30.260
It's one of the things that creates a great deal of frustration for people who would like to see this program go ahead and see it as has a fan as having fantastic potential The way you see the program works this way an individual may work from five days to 10 days within what is a two week pay period In other words we have people who the individual is guaranteed at least five days The large number of the people who are in the program are black and Puerto Rican The program is built or designed to offer training

Speaker 16 00:23:14.840
There are many many difficulties with it because it spotted in a very very slim bank sort of a fashion last July We came aboard That is the Department of Personnel comes came aboard purely to handle the personnel function of very small staff at that exists now Department of Personnel which it is expected to expand and to set up a personnel program for it This however is not yet in complete operation and the program itself is an experimental one is not one that yet is completely formed

Speaker 4 00:23:52.490
So we have to It is the potential of this program that is the important thing Excuse me When you say potential potential for developing better screening techniques or potential for getting better jobs for people or what potential for developing people are giving them training or getting jobs for them potential also for better screening techniques

Speaker 17 00:24:20.390
Because I think that this is the largest number of that we can find in one place

Speaker 4 00:24:31.100
Nine thousand of poor people largely composed of black and Puerto Rican who could comprise an experimental population for testing one of the difficulties with the test validity studies by test validity that means finding out whether tests measure what they are really supposed to measure right is that in an ordinary civil service testing procedure or in an ordinary employment testing procedure you're able only to look at the people who have passed the test You don't know very much about the people who have not passed the test

Speaker 18 00:25:19.250
And some of those who might not have passed the test might be able to do the job might as well as people who did pass the test might And in fact when you talk about validity you're saying well does the test really separate those who when they pass it can do the job better than those who can't pass it Beautifully stated

Speaker 7 00:25:36.770
And when you and your program The Wrap program you have a large number of people who haven't taken any test yet at all But later I will take some test hopefully for various civil service jobs and at that point in time possibly you might be able to find out which ones of them are better performers and not as good performers and which type of test do a better job of selecting them

Speaker 16 00:26:00.310
Yeah

Speaker 17 00:26:00.620
We have for example the job of office assistant which is an a counterpart for the title of clerk in a permanent civil service title We can look at it We it's possible to look at the performance of the people in the title of office assistant and see how well they are doing Then when they take the civil service examination for Clark we can see whether those people who are doing very very well as office assistants did well on a test for Clark and they're right there on the job

Speaker 18 00:26:39.470
And you can you can study it this way it's not What are some of the techniques you want to use Because this has something to do Very briefly Could you give us a couple of new techniques you want to you You told us about the memory test with the pictures Would you give a couple of other techniques it might be used to help make tests fairer

Speaker 17 00:26:58.610
Well I think that using a non social social relations test for picture type examinations this is one thing I think that I would like to do Let's say if I could work one on if we could get started in research on this area on the on the population I would like to use different types of judgment situations I think it's very important Other types of memory tests other than picture memory are they there There are researchers establish that memory is not a an ability that applies to only a general ability that is but that it does apply to specific areas people who can remember numbers sometimes are not the very same people who remember pictures

Speaker 19 00:27:51.830
All right That's a very good way of summarizing some of the things that helped to make tests fairer Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been Dr. Herb White who is director of the executive unit of the wrap program of the New York City department of personnel Thanks for being our guest on tonight television her
