Speaker 1 00:00:01.840
Our job opportunities for black professionals decreasing How does a young black college graduate go about finding a job in today's market What are the opportunities for blacks in major corporations here Richard Clarke president of Richard Clarke associates Answer these questions on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason A program that will examine the roots of the black box

Speaker 2 00:00:46.810
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:07.810
With us tonight on soul of reason is Richard Clarke RICHARD CLARKE associates

Speaker 3 00:01:12.370
And we're going to be talking about the black employment situation particularly with black professionals and black people with skills Glad to have you with us tonight Rich thank you

Speaker 4 00:01:22.030
Now could we just begin by raising this question that had been raised earlier that is opportunities for blacks in the job market are beginning to dry up It has been suggested that that is the case Many of the young black college graduates are saying I got my degree and I can't get a job now it's true that some other went into teaching and that's a tough field But what is the story this is your area and your organization is working with us every day

Speaker 5 00:01:52.240
Well I think it's a twofold problem one is that we industry as a matter of fact oversold our opportunities for blacks in industry in the first place out of the Civil Rights Movement came the equal opportunity employment laws which required that companies go down in college campuses Point one that recent time some 550 companies descended on Howard University's campus to employ or to seek to employ just some three hundred and twenty graduates

Speaker 6 00:02:19.420
That's point to something candidate for comment for a company now and that on the assumption that we're looking for the whole person That's really a sham On the other hand during the late 60s companies were scooping up blacks right out of schools with any kinds of degrees to put them into their training programs and beginning positions in the companies particularly to meet what they anticipated were affirmative action or Federal Contract Compliance rate Right now the compliance laws have not diminished much to my surprise and delight of course they are just going and other avenues they now have class action suits that they're available to an individual who can take a major company to court and the company then has to prove that they are not guilty and the individual has access to company records because the E one reports these reports that companies have to make out to show what progress they're making in minority employment are this public information So they the very law they the forms that they have to fill out work against them So they are now still moving in the direction of employing blacks However I think we have synthesized the kinds of people that companies are trying to get to now We are looking for people because of the economy and because of a saturation at the lower level looking for people who bring something to bear on a profit picture of the company Companies have been severely criticized not only for not hiring blacks particularly for not promoting blacks

Speaker 3 00:03:50.350
That's particularly a problem And of course that gets in that old circle of skills For example in my work at New York University run into a number of people who come looking for let's say a black geologist who has had experience looking out for some particular rare mineral You don't have many white people who have had experience and certainly not even reasonable to expect that of any considerable number of blacks if any so that we get trapped in that circle And as you suggested earlier many of the companies put the young black graduates professionals into beginning level jobs and they move up to a certain point and then you see a lot of lateral movement Exactly No upward movement

Speaker 7 00:04:27.370
The invisible ceiling so to speak no particular reason why they're not making progress Except that no plan had been made for them to go beyond that point So a lot of utter frustration and because of the needs of other companies who hadn't even begun the debt ceiling motion they are taking blacks from companies who are who have like middle management positions and putting them in higher echelons I think that's going to continue and I think that the whole focus on the employment of blacks is going to become more intense over the next three or four years Blacks minorities and particularly women

Speaker 4 00:04:59.800
Black women include incidentally well now in looking at this sort of a circle on one hand we say the the appliance compliance regulations for civil rights are bringing more minorities in On the other hand we say that they get in to a certain point in a sort of a ceiling there So that yet these company still have to increase the number of people because their goals are far greater than where they are now So where are they going to put them

Speaker 7 00:05:27.790
All right The goals are numerical goals up to a point You have to say you have to have a certain number of managerial professional and technical people on board managerial is a you know broad broad

Speaker 8 00:05:41.090
That's right You can get a lot of things that an awful lot of people a skill That's right

Speaker 9 00:05:45.260
So you have a lot of people coming into this area If you have a single salesman for instance he in fact can be a manager of his territory He may be supervising just one secretary but the law is so loose in this regard or the language really not the law that this may cover that whole possibility But what is more pernicious than anything else is the fact that there is still more language out there ahead of actuality ahead of the fact of what's going on and what is hurting the youngster coming out of college today is when he looks at where his peer When we see someone who is in school when he was a freshman and the third fellow was out of the woman is out now and in the world of work they haven't made that much progress in three or four years So it becomes a little discouraging for those people who are falling behind

Speaker 10 00:06:34.070
Well now you did suggest however that some companies are beginning to move blacks into higher management or executive level positions Now is this because of an attempt just to meet a quota or a token type of thing always this because some of the companies are actually training their black professionals and executives for higher level positions Well it wasn't a question of both

Speaker 11 00:06:59.240
It's it's a little bit different I'd have to categorize the people who are making this kind of progress and you'll find that they fall into one or two categories Either they make things that blacks will buy and they're the consumer product companies or they're people in the new technology so to speak They're the if you don't mind mentioning I have to do that these are the people like the Polaroids Xerox's and the IBM They came up within the last 20 years So they almost have their management is young and enthusiastic and really I as more pointed to what profit and perhaps they're more socially conscious than companies that have unions and have a southern base of operate their operations and things of this kind So one of the companies that I mentioned in particular Joe Wilson who died recently the chairman of Xerox and started a very aggressive program to bring blacks and females into the company and then went about the business of making his corporation grow to the size it is now and then about two or three years before he died he had another assessment of where his company was coming from brought about incidentally by a Black Caucus within the company who said Mr. Wilson's words are not meeting up with his actions and we requested advice vs. I got a meeting with his words right And they requested a meeting with Mr. Wilson and they sat down and he was appalled and he went out and called all of his managers and said You will now go out and find me people at the levels that they should have been that had we done our homework you say and now you find blacks and Xerox at some very very high levels are responsible positions that do have an impact on the profit situation

Speaker 9 00:08:30.290
And this is where people have their greatest vertical mobility

Speaker 3 00:08:33.860
If you're in a staff position you don't have very much to do with the profit line position you have to do a great deal with because you made an interesting point and that is that these industries that are doing this are in the new technologies where aggressiveness skill quickness and so on count whereas some of the older line businesses many of the retail businesses and so on a lot of business is done in the club and on the golf course and through the family And it's more a question of who you know rather than what you know exactly But of course that's part of the world of business too And I would assume that if blacks are going to break into that circle or break that cycle they're going to have to get into the circle Yes the other

Speaker 9 00:09:17.810
On the other hand we have a growing syndrome in this company called corporate social responsibility that sort of covers an area that had never been covered before even have vice presidents

Speaker 12 00:09:32.010
Now I think the small but companies are very aware now of their market and their so-called public and whatnot

Speaker 7 00:09:46.940
And a lot of pressure has been brought to bear on companies who thought in recent years that they were impervious to such a social pressure Even some of the steel companies for instance have had tremendous reactions at their board meetings to stockholder groups Now some form by churches some formed by women's groups a coalition of civil rights groups and whatnot And once you bring pressure to bear in these kinds of markets or these kinds of arenas it has something to do with the cost of the stock with it whether it's going to rise or fall

Speaker 3 00:10:15.200
And people seem to react to that No one wants trouble in this corporation likely one is cooperation on the big board Exactly And then But what what's the outcome of the social responsibility does that mean these companies aren't now really trying to give more opportunities to blacks

Speaker 11 00:10:28.850
I would have to say so for two reasons

Speaker 9 00:10:30.980
First if I didn't believe it the the public that I serve would be walking a tightrope of indecision and on the other hand I witness it Maybe not to the extent that I'd like to see it done but I am always very pleasantly surprised at the kinds of companies that get involved socially that have to do things to do with the environment had things to do with the employment and promotion of blacks The structure of necessary courses on black college campuses teacher exchange where in some situations they actually loan out an executive to a small black college to teach retailing on a teach cost accounting as it affects a particular kind of market and things of this kind And of course no one corporation feels as though they are doing all that should be done so they're very reluctant to talk about it

Speaker 3 00:11:22.450
Now I can understand their social responsibility by lending people and giving assistance and so on But is it really social responsibility to employ blacks Or is it just plain good or no business

Speaker 7 00:11:38.550
Oh that's that's good name good business sense and they have more than just a a conscious effort to be concerned about they have the the the presence of the law Both city state and federal and they also have the pressure incidentally of blacks white co-workers one bank president told me for instance in a very irate manner looking out of his window he said you know my problem is not you blacks My problems is trying My problem is trying to get young whites to come work for the bank and part of the first question session that they participate in has to do with what our employment policy is to what blacks and women And for a while we thought it didn't matter to them one way or the other but we found that we were losing some bright young men and women who would not work for a company that did not have a measurable social responsibility program

Speaker 4 00:12:32.500
What about the allegation of some of these companies that they can't find qualified

Speaker 12 00:12:38.400
I know this is something that you enjoy very much you can sort of tell us about that

Speaker 13 00:12:42.450
Well that's been one of the oldest adages you know since the beginning of time and the employment of blacks I have developed an equation for that and it's simply there are enough qualified blacks around to fill the reasonable number of existing jobs that white people have opened For instance if a corporation had nine sales jobs open and I could locate the nine best salesman in the country and they were black they wouldn't hire nine black salesmen They might hire two or three right tops So don't tell me that you can't find qualified people and then back to the geologist situation that we mentioned may be on or off the year there is a black geologists available They may be a half a dozen but the point is the company will say well gee I'd like to have 10 or 12 or 15 people from which to make a selection Now one black geologist in terms of our situation here in the country is worth 10 interim views the numerical equation out work it out One geologist for what he has learned and what he has been able to do is the equivalent of 10 I'm not saying he's worth 10 whites I'm saying that he's the equivalent of 10 Why you know Mark Yes in the personnel market and the same thing engineers

Speaker 4 00:13:52.950
That then puts the company in a position of saying well look if I want to let's say a black geologist and there's one guy that comes that means I hire him which is sort of at variance with the way in which companies usually work except where their family friends involved namely that they like to have an opportunity as you say to pick and choose And this does mean that companies have to do business somewhat differently even to the point sometimes of paying blacks more than they pay whites for comparable work although I understand now that the EEOC is beginning to say that might not be exactly fair

Speaker 7 00:14:24.900
Well I don't know that that it really happens

Speaker 9 00:14:27.090
What usually happens is if one person gets a job a black person gets a job at Corporation a and works there for two years and then goes to work because he feels he's not making progress goes to work for corporation B Corporation B has to hire him at the salary equal to the salary they'd left that or with a slight increase in pay

Speaker 11 00:14:45.900
When normally a man with two years experience coming up through the ranks would not be at that salary range So the contention is not an external I'm paying you more

Speaker 9 00:14:54.510
It's an internal consideration of what the salary structure is within that company So they've got company B does fine that they're paying to add up to having more or fifteen hundred dollars more for a person who if he had worked with the company from the outset would not be earning that kind of salary

Speaker 10 00:15:09.540
And I'm sure that that happens with people other than Oh sure

Speaker 8 00:15:13.050
Well the normal progression of going out is driving jobs of course they move around sometimes we don't do it often enough unfortunately

Speaker 3 00:15:18.840
Well tell us about what Richard Clarke associates does to help black people deal with the very problems that we're talking about

Speaker 7 00:15:26.490
Well actually I'm a sort of a catalyst in the way I deal with companies in terms of the kinds of needs that they have and they have to go out and find people to fill these needs We have always felt and it's been proven over the last 17 years that we've been in this business that there are a number of blacks available for the kinds of jobs that are available Companies offer and there are a number of people who can be trained to do these jobs

Speaker 9 00:15:49.960
So we're not when we have an opportunity to find someone who almost needs meets the skill that the company requires in this job specification We negotiate with the company to get them to not to lower the skills but to take no lower the entrance requirement but to take into consideration that this person has eight out of the 10 requirements and that his other his or her other experience may bring something else to bear here And also we do the I guess we're probably best known for our job opportunity centers which we invented back in 1964 on the same for the reason that companies were always complaining that they couldn't find qualified blacks and I was frustrated until you know the madness that everyday we were seeing people and couldn't get them appointments

Speaker 11 00:16:31.120
So I said Hey let's stop this nonsense line and I'll find them make them assemble them in a central place outside of your office No testing no receptionist who has her own view of what your policy is and they will meet under and in a new neutral circumstance and neutral environment

Speaker 9 00:16:46.540
And we did the first one at the Waldorf Astoria in 1964 and we've done five to seven a year ever since in different cities around the country with the great deal of success both for the participant and for the participating companies

Speaker 14 00:17:02.380
Now what about a young black college graduate who says that he or she is having difficulty finding his place in the labor market and literally dozens maybe hundreds of these young people To me is one of the sad things about the way in which our society is organized young people who took up the challenge to go to college to get the education and then when they come out unless they happen to run into somebody like you or me they have some difficulty getting themselves into the market now What are some of the things that they can do and I'm sure some of these young people are listening

Speaker 9 00:17:36.700
Well I you know the the interesting thing is unfortunately neither the black or the white schools teach people how to go out into the world of work and find a job They prepare you to meet the challenge of a job but not how to get it in the first place And I guess one of the easiest things to do is one of the things that is overlooked most go to the public library take a look at the Labor Department studies as to which industries are postured to hire more people within that given decade And if you find a slot let's say it's sales marketing or biological research or chemical research or for that matter the obvious computer programming and whatever Find out what it takes to get into this kind of industry right there in the library are these books that have this information available to you pick out a company in a geographical area that you want to work in get an annual report on the company that annual report will show you what the company makes where they make it what their sales are where their offices are located etc. then prepare a letter or a résumé and their books it'll teach you how to do that to send it to the company with a covering letter saying I've looked I've researched this company and it seems like the kind of company I'd like to dedicate my career to Now that sounds like a certain amount of you know preamble to what really is going on but this is what the company wants to hear They're interested in people who have an interest in them and who have taken the time to find out something about them Most company interviewers are often embarrassed by the fact that someone sits down and they say well fine Mr. Brown what would you like to do for this company Respondent his response is anything I'll take any job

Speaker 14 00:19:08.940
Well he doesn't even know where to begin to tell you either about the cover or not Not at all

Speaker 9 00:19:12.760
So it does pay to research the company and find out something about it then go down there with an idea of what the company is all about

Speaker 10 00:19:18.580
Well what about young people who've already graduated and have some skills Many of them might be skills in areas like sociology or education psychology English What about young people like in those categories because those seem to be the young people who are having difficulty Some times you might find a graduate from a business program a marketing program but generally because of the nature of the curriculum they know how to get into business or to get into jobs And of course we talk about business but they are a considerable number of jobs in government as well Ball State local and federal government But

Speaker 3 00:20:01.960
What about those young people how do they make this transition They were trained to be a teacher and all of a sudden they're no teaching job teaching jobs and know the welfare department is cutting back on investigators and you don't want an all the entry level jobs you used to get into overdrive

Speaker 7 00:20:17.110
Well one of the fastest growing areas right now probably will be for the next decade is sales and companies both drug companies the companies that make foodstuffs and things of this kind are anxious to get people with any kind of a college background into sales and auto sales you can get into marketing and this includes females as well as matter of fact probably one of the highest paid most successful female salesmen works for a drug company in New Jersey We place there about five years ago and she's a regional supervisor now Another example is a young man who works for Polaroid who is a regional manager on the West Coast He did he has barely a high school diploma but he has an aptitude and an interest in sales So what you have to do is kind of it's I guess a trite phrase but reorder your priorities and try to get into a new feel at whatever salary level you can get into it Now the problem is a lot of us get stuck You get a teacher who's been there for four or five years They have some tenure they have a salary level they have responsibilities at that salary level and in order to change careers it's going to be difficult to make it even a transitional move into another job category So you're gonna have to make some sacrifices they've got to feel that you feel you That has some vertical mobility in it and try to learn as much about it and rise in it

Speaker 14 00:21:33.850
Now you mentioned sales as one of the growing areas for the next 10 years Are there some other areas that young blacks or blacks who feel that they have stagnated in their positions might look to healthcare delivery is one of the fastest growing

Speaker 7 00:21:49.620
Now what do you mean by health care delivery that care that could be anywhere from the top of the pyramid in hospital meaning hospital administration to administration of some of the well they call it the Medicare of the Medicare payment plan and plan as if they did anything you'll find a lot of people that we found over the last few years with a degree in sociology and an aptitude for figures I don't mean that you're a financial genius but that they can work with figures to a point at which they can become a part of an administrative staff of one of these kinds of health care delivery programs The federal government and I don't remember which unit puts out a whole brochure of new job categories Most of them don't even require a degree but with a degree you're two years ahead of the people who maybe just getting into this now and it covers a whole spectrum of services that have to do with the needs of cities and states and federal districts

Speaker 14 00:22:43.630
Because one thing is sure the days when the corporations and the government swamped the campuses OK We've gotten more jobs than we have You have graduates and we we'll take back that anyone gone if they ever really existed I think they really exist because I know of several situations where a goodly number of corporations came to campuses but out of it maybe only 20 or 30 Right And let me try I was thinking of a large campus with 34000 people but they really didn't pull out of a lot of people So part of it was a fiction there

Speaker 10 00:23:17.650
But then we have this situation where many of the young blacks when they went to college about four or five years ago thought about service to the black community And when they think about working in an industry on a corporation they feel that they are not serving the black community How do you counter that type of argument

Speaker 7 00:23:38.530
Well we had a visit up to Harvard I think it was two years ago to speak to the Black MBA group up there and I was talking about opportunities and industry and what They were listening listening very quietly and at the end of the talk Someone said well how or why are you telling me to go work for the man and you're working for yourself And it stunned me for a moment because I had thought about it in quite that way And my answer was simply that had I been given an opportunity now to go into the personnel field I would have gone to work for a company for a couple of years first and a reason for that is simply that you have to get some of the practical experience and if you're going to knock some of the rough edges off of your own investment or your own participation with the community it's best to do it in someone else's time and someone else's salary and more importantly there is a real need for communication you need to know people in the same kinds of fields that you're going in so that you can get goods and services delivered at a faster rate and a better price And if you're going to go to work in the community then you need to go to work at that at a sacrifice if you will whether whether you go into your own business or to go to work for a community organization so that you can learn your craft and really be productive I doubt very seriously whether Mr. Henry Parkes or that gentleman who owns the North Carolina Mutual is anxious to have a Black MBA come down and tell him how to run his business I think Black MBA will find that he's going to be told all right you go sit over in that corner over there and you leaf through these books and underline every place you see North Carolina Mutual Henry pork sausage and did learn something about the business I think the the the view is honorable and I think it's exciting But I think it's it's not as as

Speaker 3 00:25:14.630
There's a certain amount of realism involved Right Business is business regardless of its color acquires certain basic skills And as you suggest one of the best ways of laying the skills go to work for somebody who is already functioning Whether it be a black firm or a white firm of course another point which might be recognized is that by having blacks in positions of line of already in major corporations you can influence decisions yes which affect blacks pricing policies merchandising policies distribution distribution policies etc. which have tremendous impact and just the mere fact that by getting the goods out at a certain time in a certain place causes the goods to get to the black community at a cheaper rate is of benefit to those individual blacks who want to be buying those bought

Speaker 7 00:26:06.250
Absolutely this was brought home to bear with a meeting I attended about three days ago There was a gentleman from a large cosmetic company there who told us that he has the authority to say which model appears in any of the ads that come out of this company and he insists Of course if they're dealing with a black publication that the model be black and that the photographer the black as well Now these are may not seem like tremendous numbers of jobs but for high fashion photographers and models are paid very very well And if he's in a position to do this kind of thing he is in fact working for a White Company and servicing the black community in a very productive way

Speaker 3 00:26:45.430
And in law those areas have been almost exclusively whites of course Absolutely So they are a tremendous number of opportunities or ways in which blacks in the corporations and industrial structure can actually help the black community that directly serving it

Speaker 7 00:27:00.460
Exactly and you don't lose your identity as a black person or as a woman or whatever If you go to work for a corporation that's a misnomer

Speaker 14 00:27:06.790
Well do you think that things are going to get better because they were seen to be very good very optimistic They seem to have leveled some slip somewhat Do you think they're going to get better now Yes I think they're going to improve

Speaker 9 00:27:18.370
I think they're going to improve for social reasons and I think they're going to improve more realistically from just from a profit reasons companies are short handed of people who learn skills and we're learning more and we're doing more

Speaker 3 00:27:32.920
Okay Dick I think you've given our audience a very good insight particularly our young audience into what it takes to get into the world of work and to benefit from some of this education that they've worked so hard to get I'd like to thank our guest Richard Clarke Richard Clarke associates for being with us on tonight soul of reason Thank you
