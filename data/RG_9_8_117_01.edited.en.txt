The recent problems in South Africa have highlighted the importance of Africa and world affairs. Here, Professor Hollis Lynch of Columbia University discuss South Africa and black America's response on tonight's Soul of Reason.

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:36.781
This is Soul of Reason, a program that will examine the roots of the black box. Soul of Reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior Director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:01:03.630
Our guest on tonight's Soul of Reason is Professor Hollis Lynch who is a professor of history and also works in the Institute of Afro-African African Studies at Columbia University. And Hollis we're glad to have you with us tonight to talk about this issue of South Africa how it relates to American black how it relates to World Pan Africanism and maybe we can just start with the most obvious symptom of the problem which is Zimbabwe which was the African name for Rhodesia. Real question is can the conflict between blacks and the white minority there actually be resolved without violence in your opinion.

Hollis Lynch 00:01:45.390
Roscoe I don't think so tall. As you well know Rhodesia or Zimbabwe as the Africans prefer to call it and South Africa, represent the last two holdouts of white supremacist rule in southern Africa. I think that the situation was somewhat transformed in the last two years with the loss of the first of the Portuguese territories, Angola and Mozambique. These territories being won by the freedom fighters. This put a good deal of pressure on the whites in Rhodesia. The situation there is as follows. There are some 270,000 whites who wielding all the political and economic power as against more than six million oppressed Africans. The, as I say, the transformed situation with the independence in Mozambique and Angola, are putting a lot of pressure on the whites but there they're still holding out. I think that they will not be able to hold out for very much longer. And in fact I think it's in their interests to come to terms with the Africans but they're being quite bullheaded.

Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:03:23.970
They want everything and I think for the audience to really understand this, this is a country where literally was at 4 percent of the population controls the total economy, controls the social and political life--

Radio Bumper Intro 00:03:36.691
--precisely

Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:03:37.231
of the indigenous people--

Hollis Lynch 00:03:40.681
-- preciselythe African people. Now the people in Rhodesia argue that when they moved into this area somewhere around the turn of the century there were not many indigenous people there.

Hollis Lynch 00:03:49.440
This is certainly not historically accurate at all.

00:03:51.751
That's what I'm developing this is the way the there's the development of the sympathy for the position which then says that since this white labour came in and did such a fantastic job of developing this highly industrialised economy to kick them out or in a so-called independent Rhodesia not to let them have at least half of the government is unfair.

Hollis Lynch 00:04:14.070
Yes, and this is--

Roscoe C. Brown J 00:04:14.074
And that is the type of thing that needs to be the public at large both black and white needs to be educated about.

Hollis Lynch 00:04:20.670.0000000000291
Yes that kind of view is a great distortion. This was a highly populous area. The whites came in and through trickery was able to impose through trickery and I suppose one might say superior technology was able to

Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:04:39.180
make guns

Hollis Lynch 00:04:40.161
Guns indeed. Guns indeed was able to imposed their rule and their will rather ruthlessly on the African population. So today we have a situation where the 270,000 whites owned more than half of the best lands of the country. And as we've said before they have political and economic power in their hands. It is said that the standard of living of the Rhodesian whites is probably the highest in the world even though a worker has a

Roscoe C. Brown Jr 00:05:16.061
has a swimming pool

Hollis Lynch 00:05:17.301
has a swimming pool and so naturally they're not -- they're very reluctant to give this up. They're very reluctant to give this up. And it is this kind of situation that is, is bound to lead, lead to violence. The... there are some chances that should be said that the situation might be resolved not completely without violence because because of the attitude of the whites, but the whites might be made to see sense partly as a result of the diplomatic initiative initiative taken by Secretary of State Kissinger and the willingness of South Africa for its own. Let me quickly add selfish reasons to cooperate here.

Speaker 8 00:06:13.160
South Africa is concerned that of as it were extending the area it might might have to fall off military operation.

Speaker 3 00:06:25.010
Of course you're really underlining the basic problem which we are really devoting ourselves to and that is that Zimbabwe Rhodesia and South Africa are the last bastions of minority white control on the African continent and they extend the face of the tide of progress because both of them have highly industrialised economies and they have access to mineral resources which the United States and the West deems to be important. They tend to have been able to hold on longer than some of the more the less affluent colonial regimes in Portugal Portuguese colonies on the French colonies. But the fact is that the sands of time are moving on and we'll certainly catch them. So when you say that the Kissinger initiative has been made partially successful by the South Africans getting involved to help save their own skin that was raised the question as to what is the ultimate for example you suggest that as a result of the freedom fighters the guerrilla movements Angola and Mozambique and Portuguese Gates gave up and left. And as you know the Portuguese from Mozambique and from Angola are having a tough time back in Portugal which itself as an oppressed economy the Rhodesians basically the English the South Africans are both Dutch and English and there are many many more South Africans I think some 4 million less than whites in South Africa. They have a highly industrialized army they have even access to nuclear weapons etc. so that it is certainly difficult to conceptualize what a violent confrontation might do to this section of Africa and to the world. Yet as you suggest your belief is that this is what's going to happen.

Speaker 9 00:08:16.280
In other words you are saying that your considered belief is that the negotiations to get the white minority rule alleviated removed from southern Africa probably won't go without some violence.

Speaker 10 00:08:32.960.0000000000582
Well definitely it's difficult to see it going without violence let me say that the Rhodesian question in retrospect I think we'll find it and that will be easier to settle. I think that whatever the resistance there is going to be on the part of Rhodesian whites. I would predicted within three years this question would be settled. In other words the Western capitalist country and South Africa itself is prepared to as it were give up Rhodesia all the more to protect South Africa as well as of course Western vested interest in South Africa. I think a shop is a fairly sharp distinction could be made between Rhodesia and South Africa.

Speaker 11 00:09:24.470
I can eat I can see Rhodesia being won over by the African liberation forces the South African situation I mean won over by the violence by a well thought out by a number of a number of factors including violence guerrilla warfare including the pressure that's being applied by the freedom fighter and the freedom fighters.

Speaker 9 00:09:47.660
You really are predicting in the sense a majority rule and freedom for Zimbabweans no more than three years.

Speaker 11 00:09:55.610
Indeed I am probably in a short period of time I'm probably in a shorter period because a number of factors that are making for this now I want to see what is true about the South African situation so an African situation as I've said before is much more difficult.

Speaker 12 00:10:10.940
You quite rightly quite rightly pointed to the fact that the white population is much more populous more than 4 million.

Speaker 10 00:10:20.210
It's thought Africa is much more highly industrialised the West the United States and Europe have considerably more economic investments in South Africa. You're not going to see in South Africa the kind of one diplomatic initiative to bring about majority rule that you were seeing in Rhodesia.

Speaker 13 00:10:43.730
But I do think that changes are going to come in South Africa.

Speaker 14 00:10:51.740
It will not be absurd in my view to predict perhaps within 10 to 20 years. And I know this is sticking my neck out a bit. Majority rule in South Africa a truly multiracial society for that they.

Speaker 7 00:11:08.330
All right 20 years goes awfully fast. I can remember when apartheid first came in about 25 years ago.

Speaker 12 00:11:14.810
I think the basis for this is the fact the very basic fact that the standard of living the economic life are off South Africa rest fully on the black population. In other words we're not for the exploitation of the black population the very populous black population more than 16 million South Africa could not maintain itself economically. And here is the contradiction. Despite the official policy of apartheid if a path side were to be fully carried out the white standard of living would drop disastrously. In other words the whites cannot afford to now so long as you have a large and growing black urban population in South Africa that the whites are dependent upon it means that their own situation is shaky. Of course despite attempts despite attempts to to siphon off leadership to encourage disunity among blacks blacks are becoming more and more militant. More and more sophisticated and are finding themselves despite the fact that do not have the normal political channels through strikes and such action to to demand more and more concessions. And they are rarely in a position to to cripple exact them to cripple their economy the economy so that ICE would more and more organization and more and more militants and more and more unity in the black population given in increasing industrialization and increasing dependence upon black labor. I do not see that the whites can continue without without making major concessions.

Speaker 3 00:13:23.210
But do you think that American blacks can or will are able to do anything to accelerate that.

Speaker 4 00:13:30.320
Yes only indirectly. I think that American blacks. Let me say as you probably well know have long been interested in Africa I would say a substantial list minority of American black intellectuals and black people have always shown a very strong interest in Africa. We're talking this evening with Professor Hollis Lynch who is Professor of History at Columbia University and works in the Institute of African studies there.

Speaker 9 00:14:06.910
And as you were saying Hollis that black Americans have long had an interest in Africa and this relates of course to the overall Pan African Movement.

Speaker 3 00:14:16.950
I think it would be of interest to our audience as we talk about Pan African Movement and talk about South Africa is to backtrack a little bit and talk about the history of these areas before the whites came as we said at the top of the show. It's sort of a stereotype to say that nothing was happening in Haiti made things happen. But what about the type of people who were living in the area which is called Zimbabwe Namibia which is south west Africa South Africa. How did the people develop and how. As you said through this trickery and so on was white oppression instituted because it really is and of long history it is not something it goes back for centuries at least in that particular part of the world in total. So could you begin to develop.

Speaker 11 00:15:09.730
Yes.

Speaker 15 00:15:11.290
The people who were in southern Africa before the coming of the whites were largely the Bantu people very vigorous people that had occupied all of us southern Africa long before the coming of the Europeans the British iron technology agriculture and so on.

Speaker 16 00:15:40.870
The whites the very first whites came in about the middle of the 17 century about.

Speaker 14 00:15:52.930
And but there's no question as I've said before that the Africans were already in occupation of the land. But it is true that white white occupation inside so in South Africa in Cape Town area goes back to the middle of the 17th century and they used this as a claim that they were there before the Africans.

Speaker 16 00:16:26.290
But that cannot be that is simply historical.

Speaker 14 00:16:31.420
In the case of Rhodesia that's quite different. So the case of Rhodesia the watch did not get there until late 19th century and there's absolutely no question as I've said before that that this was a very well populated area by force of arms by the use of guns.

Speaker 17 00:16:51.760
They were able to prevail now in your work as a professor of history at Columbia and working with African studies. You're certain that you work not only with a white student but you work with a considerable number of black student. Yes that's correct. And obviously have a lot of interaction with the black community the Pan African ism has been sort of a dream.

Speaker 9 00:17:17.310
It's been a dream that people like Dubois and through Garvey impaired more and so on have had and many of the students particularly during the revolution of the 60s embraced Pan African ism as a social and political philosophy. What is really happening with an African ism. How does it relate if at all to the struggles of people in southern Africa for freedom in by the way that's a tough question.

Speaker 7 00:17:46.060
I got a good professor.

Speaker 14 00:17:49.470
I think in 1960s you had what might be call an outpouring of sentimental Pan African ism.

Speaker 18 00:17:57.630
People were sort of overtly demonstrating their identification with Africa.

Speaker 11 00:18:05.760
And this is understandable in view of the newly independent African countries and in view of the fact that there had been before a certain amount of ambivalence about Africa while the wide open African ism has a long tradition among black American. It is true there was also among certain segments a certain amount of ambivalence about Africa because of the way Africa was portrayed trading in textbooks by whites.

Speaker 14 00:18:32.940
But in the 60s you see what political independence with the United States government and Russia courting Africa. Black people were in a position here to identify openly with Africa.

Speaker 19 00:18:47.280
And so you had an outpouring of what might be called a sentimental Pan African ism manifesting itself in the wearing of dashiki and the so-called Afro hairstyle Irelands on and so forth but also of course there were those who were concerned about the practical aspects of African ism the political aspects of that African ism which would take the form of promoting political economic and social liberation in Africa which would take the form of trying to influence the United States government for instance so that they would it would act favorably towards Africa by the way.

Speaker 7 00:19:33.930
Do you think we've been very successful for example recently the United States abstained on the United Nations resolution on a trans guy which was that so-called independent nation that South Africa set up well within its boundaries to sort of give the world the impression that there was some kind of freedom and United States abstained on the resolution to boycott the trans guy and some of us feel that that represents the fact that those of us in the black academic and social and political community have been very effective. So maybe that goal hasn't yet been reached and of course the question is how do we reach that goal.

Speaker 15 00:20:10.440
Is it only perhaps has only been partially reach. It is true without doubt that as a group we have not been terribly successful. If you like in lobbying effectively on behalf of Africa for instance as other groups have lobbied very effectively on behalf of their own country so maybe that goal hasn't yet been reached.

Speaker 7 00:20:46.320
And of course the question is how do we reach that goal.

Speaker 15 00:20:48.480
Is it only perhaps there's only been partially reach. It is true without doubt that as a group we have not been terribly successful. If you like in lobbying effectively on behalf of Africa for instance as other groups have lobbied very effectively on behalf of their own home country particularly as the Jewish American population is effectively lobbying Israel.

Speaker 7 00:21:17.070
That is an excellent example.

Speaker 18 00:21:18.690
Let's stop sending examples but it is equally true that such all say in the 60s for instance such organizations as all the major organizations the NAACP whole National Urban League and the NSC snake and so on.

Speaker 14 00:21:35.670
Well rightly concerned about Africa and in their own ways tried to convey this to the United States government. I was in war spent several months in Washington at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars earlier this year and talked to one or two State Department people about this and they claim that the black American lobby for Africa is virtually non-existent that's about the case is it is it is weak.

Speaker 7 00:22:08.460
Recently the Congressional Black Caucus as you know organized what they call the Black Leadership Conference on Africa and one of the objectives of that was to strengthen or to organize a black American lobby for the Southern states.

Speaker 18 00:22:22.620
It seems to me this is one area in which the various black American organizations could get together because everybody is theoretically united on this point that white supremacist rule and Southern Africa should end.

Speaker 14 00:22:36.520
As you say there should be concerted effort here. But generally what you do have sometimes is like one organization like Jesse Jackson's PUSH taking the initiative without consulting with the others. There should be more consultation and more concerted effort here cause and effect. I suppose the most potent lobby is the Black Congressional Caucus itself. Well that's what happened. If you recall either that black leadership conference headed by Charles Diggs the congressperson from Michigan who's had a great interest in now. Precisely so they brought all of these organizations together to agree on what was called the African-American manifesto out of Africa socially which was approved unanimously by the group and was presented just about the time that Kissinger was making his forays into Rhodesia.

Speaker 3 00:23:31.920
Unfortunately that manifesto which I'm sure you're familiar with and I personally attended the conference which developed it has not gotten the type of press publicity and not just in a white community but even the black community. And I think that one of the things that professors like yourself and myself and others interested have to do is to begin to elucidate these issues. For example your differentiation between what I think you called emotional or mental sentimental Pan African ism and sociopolitical political Pan African. Yeah very good point which led me to want to ask you the question which even I know you don't have never really asked you. How would you evaluate the Pan African ism of Garvey in the 20s or the Pan African ism of WB Dubois in the early 20th century.

Speaker 13 00:24:30.510
How would you evaluate those two once I've had enough yes Garvey's put Afrikaners was in a sense protest Pan African ism. It was but it was very effective at the psychological level. Garvey was saying in effect early black is beautiful.

Speaker 12 00:24:48.240
We are a people with substantial achievements. We should take pride in our past in our history culture. We should mobilise ourselves. We should become important actors on the world stage. Garvey of course was not so much interested.

Speaker 14 00:25:04.590
And for instance influencing United States policy towards Africa. Garvey was interested in taking independent action. And of course one might raise the question how realistically black Americans acting independently could bring about the liberation of Africa.

Speaker 7 00:25:27.240
That is not about economic interdependence of blacks.

Speaker 14 00:25:32.040
But but yes he was striving for that. He was driving that he wasn't successful there but I think his greatest impact was in the psychological psych logical that blacks had a new image of themselves as a result of his exertions. Also he helped to stimulate African nationalism. All the major nationalists of the time. Talk of money throughout the world. I'm particularly in Africa. Yes. That Garvey's organizations and efforts were well known in Africa and helped to further the drive towards political independence.

Speaker 3 00:26:14.210
And that's one thing that people in a given time have to think about in terms of the past whereas we have literally dozens of independent black African nations. Now at that time Mugabe we had one name in Liberia and I suppose Ethiopia might in a sense. Yeah that is true. Now what about the Pan African ism of Dubois.

Speaker 14 00:26:34.250
Again that was as you well know somewhat more elitist Dubois exponent of the talented tenth believes well actually organize about six conferences listed with six conferences between nineteen hundred and nineteen forty five. That Dubois was centrally involved in here. What was involved was bringing together black people from various parts of the world to discuss common problems and to find a common solution. And there's no question that although his movement was elitist Dubois has to rank as one of the major fathers of 20th century African ism and he saw revered in Africa today as you know.

Speaker 18 00:27:24.740
Interestingly he ended his jazz and gone Ghana as well. He was 93 at the Azores in 93 and working on the Africana encyclopedia one of his old projects.

Speaker 3 00:27:37.220
All right now one last question what about the relative roles of the various African leaders themselves. Which of the African leaders or group of African leaders do you think are most important now.

Speaker 14 00:27:51.710
African leaders you refer to southern Africa or southern Africa southern Africa where life would seem that in the Rhodesian situation Joshua and Como along with Robert Mugabe are the ones that command the greatest support in Zimbabwe constituted it has been pointed to by the press the seeming division among the African nationalists. But I don't think that that's the most serious problem the more serious problem comes from the intransigence of the white supremacists in Rhodesia and of course that so-called division might be a division that is being created a divide and rule type tactic.

Speaker 7 00:28:40.010
I think you see it's undoubtedly the case.

Speaker 14 00:28:41.870
This is being fostered by whites and I think it's unrealistic perhaps to expect a complete lack of division. But I think that there are leaders with enough support to bring about the transition to independence in radio in Zimbabwe.

Speaker 7 00:28:59.330
I certainly think so and I think your analysis is very good and I'd like to thank our guest Professor Hollis Lynch of Columbia University for discussing the Southern African situation.
