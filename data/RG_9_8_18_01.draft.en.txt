In New York City thousands of children are victims of child abuse each year Only recently has society begun to deal seriously with this important problem here Ivory car assistant director of ambulatory care Brooklyn Jewish Hospital discussed this problem on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:42.890
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:07.400
Our guest on tonight sole reason as I recall was assistant director of ambulatory care at the Jewish Hospital and Medical Center of Brooklyn and he has a particular interest in child abuse This is one of the problems that has sort of been hidden away and now we're beginning to bring it out into the open I remain You might begin by indicating how you developed your own interest in child abuse and then we'll talk about some of the things that can be done about it

Speaker 3 00:01:34.550
All right Well I began my work in a public health program at the Jewish hospital a medical center approximately eight years ago Doing that during that eight year span quite a number of public health problems have been brought to our attention All we have participated in such national programs as of lead poisoning in children And later on a couple of years ago we got involved in child abuse and neglect What we interested in what we were interested in doing that time was to develop a national program To combat child abuse and neglect or to focus national attention on this problem to mobilize the community to be aware and to develop their resources to handle this problem

Speaker 1 00:02:27.620
Let's talk about the dimensions of problem understand the federal statistics indicate something like the 100000 reported case of child abuse each year and probably several times that number of unreported cases Now what really is the magnitude what constitutes child abuse Or I would think that my opinion anything any attempt to deliberately

Speaker 3 00:02:52.640
Mistreat a child to or deliberately deny the child the bare necessities of life of any attempt to punish the child in an inhumane cruel or hostile manner and that includes not only physical punishment would even include mental punishment and include neglect in particular Yes it would It would definitely include neglect as well And all I think as we look in to some specific cases of child abuse you will understand more or the audience will understand more about what we say

Speaker 1 00:03:33.620
Oh I will Could you give us a couple of examples of what might be some really serious cases of child abuse and then we can talk about what might be done about what a hospital does what society does

Speaker 3 00:03:44.440
Right Well some are in the hospital in particular some obvious cases of abuse all might be seen or as a parent my attempt to discipline a child I think a classic example of classic example I've seen rather the situation where a mother came and reported that she was in the process of punishing the child she was beating the child with a broomstick and then the process of the child's arm was broken There are other cases where this parent admitted it yes Now all and I think each case of abuse must be examined on its merit

Speaker 4 00:04:25.360
I remember this particular parent who was crying and who stated that it was not her intent to deliberately break the child's arm but in a fit of rage a broom was used and the child was broken There are other suspicious cases that come to us through the emergency room Where a child might have an open cut or bruise and the fore head or some other place on the body where the mother can't be found The child might be brought to the emergency room by a relative and in some cases where it's reported that no one knows where the mother is or no one knows where the mother works It leads us to suspect that abuse might be involved and from there we put together our mechanism for detecting and treating cases of child abuse

Speaker 1 00:05:15.830
Now I believe it until fairly recently there was not inadequate reporting system for even getting these cases down so that then there could be something done about them Is this true has the nature of the reporting system dealing with child abuse have improved

Speaker 3 00:05:34.260
Or yes in certain areas or where you have individuals who are interested in child abuse and getting involved in preventing child abuse treating cases of child abuse or there is an improved system for reporting these cases of what must be done Is that any area which deals with all parents and children whether it's a public school a daycare center or a hospital emergency room a pediatric clinic All staff members must be taught to detect cases of child abuse and for or investigating and following up where there seems to be an indicated need are some indication that this in fact might be a case of child abuse

Speaker 1 00:06:24.440
Why do you think that it's only recently that we really beginning to see these things come to the forefront and be publicized as they are because children have been abused for centuries in a sense for decades One question I want to ask is the poor abused their children more than the middle class But let's just talk about why in 1976 there's so much emphasis on child abuse which obviously is a very serious problem and always has been a serious problem Well I think first of all it has to do with the temper of the Times or the fact that which did Are we have been injured for the past few years in developing national programs and for the prevention of child abuse that might be a factor Of

Speaker 5 00:07:13.610
Our present social and economic situation might be a factor because I think in most of the cases on child abuse you will see that the parents are under undue stress In many cases and I mentioned that today a great deal of stress is being caused by the fact that there is a high percentage of unemployment among black families There is a great deal of repression or a great deal of depression in some cases a high percentage of layoffs among black families and that sort of thing A great deal of tests are a great deal of tension and stress So I would think that

Speaker 3 00:08:03.910
As this situation the economic situation in particular continues to become worse we will probably see more and more cases of child abuse The other thing is that budget cuts which have taken place on the national of the state and city level are affecting a great deal of programs which are designed to handle this problem And as these resources are diminished all of there will be more abuse and there'll probably be fewer and fewer resources for reporting and treating these cases of abuse Now by inference I gather that you're suggesting that child abuse does occur

Speaker 6 00:08:48.220
More in low economic families than in higher economic families And further you're suggesting it might occur more in black families than it does in white families or Hispanic families or is it just strictly related to the degree of poverty

Speaker 5 00:09:02.470
I think to some extent it's related to the degree of poverty I think to some extent it's related to the living situation in which all members of different ethnic groups might find themselves Now the other thing which I haven't mentioned it It's also pointed out in much of the literature to it that the level of frustration of the parent and the tendency to abuse the child is related all I I really can't say at this point whether we can divide it among all ethnic groups black or white I think it would be more appropriate to relate it to the social situation in which people find themselves and to related to their economic conditions

Speaker 1 00:10:05.490
All right well let's say you discover a case of child abuse in your hospital your directive system director of ambulatory care at Broken Jewish Hospital and obviously you get into the clinics and you see the people as they come into the emergency room and the pediatric service et cetera and you find a certain case or a certain number of cases of suspected child abuse What does a hospital do What do they do to help the child What do they do to help the parents Well they do in terms of the legal aspects OK all if a mother or a guardian brings a child to the emergency room and abuse is suspected

Speaker 5 00:10:46.700
Or we train our nurses and I might mention the fact that the nurse who is responsible for charge and who is responsible for making the first encounter with the patient in many cases of nurses are very well trained to detect suspected cases of abuse and in many cases it is the nurse which alerts the doctor to the fact that it might be a possible child abuse cases Rather the doctors are trained also now in suspected cases of child abuse or which are obvious A child would get a full medical workup including x rays pictures would be taken The child would be admitted to the hospital The case would be referred to a social service worker or it would be thoroughly investigated The authorities would be notified before the child is released from the hospital Now if it's a definite case of child abuse Of the mother as well as the child should submit to treatment

Speaker 6 00:11:58.230
Now when you talk about contacting the parent contacting the authorities etc. What does the law really state

Speaker 1 00:12:06.960
What kind of charges can be brought against the parent or is it sort of a social service approach You try to work with the parents or the parent doesn't do this again as a combination of both

Speaker 5 00:12:16.950
It's really a combination of both But through the Bureau of Child Welfare you do have a mechanism whereby of a child could be retained in the hospital until an investigation is fully conducted and until definite decisions could be made as to whether or not it is an obvious case of child abuse or not Now all you also have law enforcement people who will back you up The child can be placed under protective custody until the medical treatment is completed and usually before the medical treatment is completed we are able to Conduct the full investigation of the case And is that to all the proper measures for correcting the problem Now in your own hospital about how many cases of child abuse do you have per year or we it comes to our attention that we have approximately 200 cases of child abuse reported per year and what we are doing now we're investigating all cases which involve or falls poisoned and suspicious injuries to see if in fact these cases were child abuse cases

Speaker 1 00:13:49.900
In other words this is what you're doing at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital to try to deal with the K the problem of child abuse in dealing with this problem What do you find to be the most serious obstacle you have to mobilizing the support of the community or mobilizing the people you work with to seriously do things to control child abuse

Speaker 3 00:14:12.760
Well first of all all cases of child abuse must be reported before anything can be done I think our greatest problem is in fact All Macon or residents of the community who might be aware of child abuse cases or you know to ensure that they will suffer any undue hardship because they in fact report a child abuse case Now if you recall our current a case of child abuse which came to our attention in New York City where all the children were reported missing in a department store and the police service and later on they found adults who reported that the mother had been abusive and that was the key factor in and solve in that case Had that been reported to the proper authorities earlier those children might have been alive today

Speaker 1 00:15:18.230
I think that's an important point Who would be the proper authorities Because I believe that in this particular case you're talking about that the neighbors reported they'd call the police officers and police officers come and knocked on the door and the mother said everything is fine and police officers left now who are the proper authorities to report child abuse to if that's going to happen when you just call the normal police channels while the Bureau of Child Welfare is one agency

Speaker 3 00:15:46.230
And I certainly wouldn't like to minimize the importance of reporting suspected cases of abuse to the police because in the hospital I have seen the police bring children in who have been abandoned for weeks or several days by their parents or in many cases it is the police that's responsible for making the initial the initial contact with an abused or a suspected abuse child

Speaker 1 00:16:16.890
I think they've been in a sense it's a question of the way in which it's reported Like if you call up and say well look there's some noise over there and he's some children crying it is conceivable that an officer might just take the mother's word that everything is okay on the other hand if it's reported Well look I think this person is really beating her children then I would give basis for looking into it more What about the personalities I'm sure that in your position as director of ambulatory care at Brooklyn Jewish you come in contact with some of the parents of these children who are abused You talked about one case early in the program but one who said it was you being a youngster with a broomstick Of course that's pretty harsh punishment anyway despite the fact that it's alleged that we ought to have more vigorous punishment of young people I would think beating some kid with a broomstick is pretty heavy punishment But aside from cases like that what has been your observation of the personalities the way in which parents who have abused their children and did not easily admit that they abused them respond to the identification that they are child abusers

Speaker 3 00:17:29.240
OK Well I think Or when we look at shall abuses are we have to look at them as parents and parents and guardians Because many children are not abused by their parents

Speaker 5 00:17:44.660
They might be abused by guardians who have voluntarily assumed responsibility for their care Now when we take into consideration the structure of many black families in the poor communities and we look at child abuse in many cases it is not the mother who is abusing the child It might be All mother's boyfriend or

Speaker 3 00:18:21.290
A child's uncle or a child's step parent who has the soon of the guardianship for the child So it all right now as far as children are concerned Abuse of involves many people who might be in contact with the child

Speaker 1 00:18:46.730
Well as you look at this from a societal point of view you're a social worker and you're interested in public health You've worked in the community when you look at this from a social point of view and you put it in perspective of poverty and racism The question and I would be moved to ask is How do you analyze what is your analysis of the reason for this and then going one step further

Speaker 7 00:19:15.020
What really can be done to mobilize the community to fight against this Because I think a child is defenseless This is one of the most inhumane things that man can do to man Yet it's only recently that we really becoming aware of this in a very open fashion is only recently that the federal government is providing funds for this now What do you think there is in society that allows us to occur and what how can we take these same forces and turn them into a positive force against child abuse Well that's a very difficult question to answer but on

Speaker 3 00:19:55.630
I I don't know I guess there are many things that go into it

Speaker 8 00:20:02.080
I don't know as a very honest one but this is why we help you to grope through it OK

Speaker 3 00:20:07.110
If you look at what happens when a case of abuse is discovered and may or may not be reported

Speaker 4 00:20:21.740
All then I think it will help us to understand where we are and how we got here

Speaker 9 00:20:29.410
What happens in a case of child abuse involves the attitude and vigilance of the person who discovers the case of child abuse It involves the philosophy of the institution in which the case of child abuse is discovered It involves the attitude of the Bureau of Child Welfare and the court which is involved in prosecuting cases of this nature

Speaker 4 00:21:06.770
Oh and first of all I think society itself plays a broader role in the overall picture because in some cases society is aware of abuses that occur in many areas but nothing is done about it or too little is done about it or too little too late is done about it It's that kind of thing

Speaker 1 00:21:29.420
This has to do with the violent psyche in American society in particular But the federal government has recognized this and I believe you said that some 70 million dollars available now for programs to work against child abuse to control child abuse Could you tell us something about those programs and indicate to what extent they've been able to penetrate New York City

Speaker 3 00:21:52.150
Well we're talking about programs which were initiated by the Department of Health Education and Welfare in 1974 I think we were talking about 70 million dollars which was all to go for the development of 12 demonstration projects to detect and treat and prevent child abuse First of all I think that amount of money was very small to begin with All I would think that a city like New York which has millions of children and millions and hundreds and thousands of cases of child abuse reported each year that would probably be enough money to develop a decent demonstration program in the city of New York Instead the small amount of money was spent nationwide All I am certain that these demonstration models are affected by budget cuts just like other programs in our communities have been affected

Speaker 1 00:22:58.130
What are the what was to be the guts of these programs I mean to enough 7 million hours is not a lot of money but what was it to be spent for what was the what was the conception of a program let's say a hospital voice Community Center has a grant for preventing child abuse what are some kinds

Speaker 8 00:23:15.720
Well we aren't toys grads was supposed to be for demonstration projects Our comprehensive demonstration projects to combat the problem of child abuse

Speaker 9 00:23:27.360
Of it would involve a system whereby cases could be reported easily

Speaker 3 00:23:34.450
It would provide a mechanism for follow up for treatment of the mother and child It would provide medical care as well as supportive services as in other programs One major component of a program on child abuse would involve psychiatry psychology a great deal of social work a great deal

Speaker 5 00:24:04.330
Of medical services and it was the purpose of the grant to develop 12 such models in the country throughout the United States

Speaker 3 00:24:20.380
And to examine these models over a three year period And after a three year period of to develop other resources in the country as needed

Speaker 7 00:24:31.270
Well I would assume that the idea behind this particular grant was to focus attention on child abuse and it developed a mechanism whereby cases could be handled directly Now I would also hope that money these grants went somewhere in New York City maybe to Brooklyn Jewish made when the other hospitals That is one of these grants Operating in New York City

Speaker 3 00:24:53.140
Oh yes I think there are two grants in New York City One Grant is located in Best Buy community It's affiliated with the Wilby school That's one grant All unfortunately a Jewish Hospital and Medical Center we were not all successful in obtaining our grant it was so it was a great disappointment to the staff because we feel that all hospitals which handle large volumes of people and which detect many cases on child abuse is a natural environment for the development of this type of program And in many cases I think you will find that hospitals Already or with the slight modification have the resources for developing these programs and for implementing these programs they can do it much faster and with a great deal of skill is and experience than many other types of programs and a community could do I believe we said you said earlier that the other program in New York City is at Beth Israel Hospital

Speaker 1 00:26:10.830
Is that correct That's in Manhattan I believe Now I would imagine that a number of people who have become involved parents guardians and child abuse who themselves don't like this characteristic of their behavior

Speaker 7 00:26:24.840
They thought of silent child abusers They haven't been caught yet yet they want help Is there any place where adults who have a tendency to abuse children in rage in fits of rage and fits of depression can go to get help

Speaker 3 00:26:42.060
Yes there are such programs as parents Anonymous of all their programs and the Department of Social Services for the city of New York There are social service departments and many hospitals throughout New York City There are many places where social services are offered to parents And I would feel that any parent who has this problem and is interested in correcting it all could begin to get help in any of these facilities

Speaker 7 00:27:18.690
In other words people who either know about child abuse cases or are interested in getting help because they are child abusers can contact their local state Department of Social Services listed in the phone book on a new york city or else possibly they could contact you library card Brooklyn Jewish Hospital What is your number there

Speaker 3 00:27:39.600
All my telephone number is two for or 1000 all We also have a very large department of Social Service which would be helpful to any parent who has this problem We also have programs and comprehensive health care which could assist parents with this problem of There are many resources which are available now I would certainly direct any parent to contact me who is interested and that would be my personal help

Speaker 1 00:28:13.970
That would be 2 for all 1000 Brooklyn Jewish Hospital Mr Ivory car Our guest on tonight's soul of reason has been ivory car who's assistant director of ambulatory care at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Medical Center and we've been talking about the important problem of child abuse in America
