Speaker 1 00:00:01.380
Thousands of black and Puerto Rican youth who have not previously had the opportunity to enter college are benefiting from special educational programs in various divisions of the City University here Dr. Roderick looney chairman of the academic development division of Medgar Evers College of the City University discuss these issues on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:45.230
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:09.620
Our guest on this evening soul of reason is Dr. Roderick Loney who is with Medgar Evers College a Division of the City University and is chairman of the academic development division there Glad to have you with us tonight Ron

Speaker 3 00:01:21.300
Okay thank you Roscoe I'm glad to be here

Speaker 4 00:01:24.110
Well we're talking tonight about something is really very important It's created a lot of controversy at the same time to create a lot of hope and then has to do with the effect of open enrollment and various programs for educationally disadvantaged students on the colleges and on the students Your job as I understand is dealing with helping these students most of whom have severe academic deficiencies to be able to function in the college environment right

Speaker 5 00:01:52.760
Could you begin by just telling us what is the purpose of these various academic activities that you conduct out of your division

Speaker 6 00:02:02.410
Actually Roscoe the students who come into us they represent a profile that reflects so about 55 percent of every incoming freshman class I would say is functioning well below the 8th grade level in terms of reading ability

Speaker 4 00:02:19.340
Now this is at Medgar Evers or is this true throughout the city university

Speaker 7 00:02:23.330
I would say this is not true throughout city university evidence

Speaker 4 00:02:27.200
It struck Medgar Evers because Medgar Evers and some of the community colleges get a larger proportion of low achieving student rights because of the way in which the students are assigned now Is it intended that Medgar Evers be sort of an educational ghetto or is it something that relates to the general neighborhood that Medgar Evers is attempting to serve

Speaker 8 00:02:47.570
I would think that it does relate to the general neighborhood that the college is intending to serve other liberally choose to deal with this some population of students who seem to need most help whereas Medgar Evers located what neighborhood is it mainly in the Central Brooklyn community That's what would be known as Bedford started and is reasonable yes I see

Speaker 5 00:03:08.490
What's the size of

Speaker 6 00:03:09.710
Medgar Evers division all Well the college itself This is its fourth year to a little active operation and the college itself has in excess of 25 hundred students It's comparatively small We are now completing a fourth year of operation as I say and getting ready for the Middle States accreditation

Speaker 5 00:03:33.320
I see you know the colleges named after the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers Yes And as you say it's been in effect an operation for four years Yes Which must mean that you have had wanted to graduating classes We have Yes All right now your department is called academic development which is in a sense reflects the fact that you're trying to improve or enhance the academic performance of those students who are coming to your college

Speaker 9 00:04:06.030
Is this a program that relates only to freshmen or does it relate to everyone in the college

Speaker 10 00:04:11.270
Well the resources of our division are available for all the students enroll at the college but we primarily deal with incoming freshmen The division also handles the testing program on the college That is we have designed and operated testing program which attempts to determine levels of performance that students bring with them when they come to college and which attempts to assess the nature of the resources and the skills which they bring Because the whole approach to learning from our point of view is not that is not really focusing only upon the weaknesses of students but also on their strengths because we've found that even students with low literacy level in many situations these students have lived and they have developed quite a lot of effective survival skills and we attempt to provide an education base built upon this as a platform

Speaker 5 00:05:09.170
You said you're running a testing program and I know that test criticized for being ethnically biased like that One of the quotes that I want to ask is How do you use these tests which were purportedly ethically biased to assess the achievement of youngsters

Speaker 11 00:05:27.440
Oh you're really cutting in on both sides Are we saying they are ethnically biased when they're against us and we're saying we want to use them when we want to use those data

Speaker 12 00:05:36.740
I think part of the problem that we face throughout the country from the east to the west is that they're ah no adequate testing instruments for getting at some of the kinds of needs that students have especially students in this economic range We do do however what we do do we have a battery of tests which students are exposed to Some of these are standardized instruments some of them our teacher made instruments But this is not the only means we use for measuring student placement or student performance levels What other means do you use Well after the student is initially tested we include in the battery a sort of background information form which gets at some of the kinds of things that the student may have done Was he a group leader in his community that is singing a church choir or was he a boy scout which gives us some feel as to the kind of frame of reference out of which the student comes In addition after the student is initially placed we do conduct some type of informal testing in the individual classrooms The student is more relaxed the instruments are more relaxed and we have a chance to get a feel for what skills what resources he might be bringing so that if in the initial testing program we may not have placed the student with sufficient kit We feel that this is one means of double checking on what we do and also revising the placement

Speaker 13 00:07:10.340
Let's deal with this because this is something that people will be concerned about You have youngsters or people and youngsters coming into college at the eighth grade reading level The question is how can these students do college work How can you do college work in sociology How can you do college work in biology when you have an 8th grade reading level Now the theory is that you are going to be developing a reading level at the same time you're teaching college work but most of the college books are written at the 12th grade of the 14th grade reading level

Speaker 14 00:07:42.080
How do you deal with that because that's an issue I know a lot of people are concerned about

Speaker 12 00:07:45.410
Well how we deal with it at Medgar Evers College is that we say that we somehow feel that within the first three semesters of a student's life at college we might be able to do some things that will help to improve that reading level sufficiently so that he can perform fairly effectively in a college program

Speaker 8 00:08:10.970
Well you're saying that at the first three semesters of really high school work Well the first three semesters what we call supplementary were guy I would hate to say it's high school work because it's more than that Well do they get college credit for it They get some partial credit for some of the work they do Partly because we do not see learning as compartmentalized when we are teaching a student

Speaker 7 00:08:32.950.0000000000582
If we are teaching him grammar if we are teaching him just basic reading writing skills There are other secondary things that he is learning while this instruction is taking place in addition to the direct instruction

Speaker 10 00:08:46.130
And in addition during these first three semesters the student is allowed to enroll for regular college courses which do not require much knowledge of reading They may be fizz Ed courses or courses in music or courses that may be especially designed so that he has a feel for what goes on in other aspects of the college's program

Speaker 13 00:09:06.020
I see well given the fact that in the first three semesters the students don't get full credit This would suggest that most of the students would take five or more years to graduate This is correct yes This is great It's well within the realm of possibility So the suggestion that you are giving is that even though the students enter at a level that is lower than most college students and that because of these special programs they reach eventually the level of any other graduating student even though it may take them five years longer to do it

Speaker 12 00:09:40.220
Right You see the thing is this Roskilde many of our students have had a hard road to a whole day They have been mis educated in some cases uneducated and we do not believe that they should be penalized for things over which they have had almost no control Some of these people are very very highly motivated and when they come to us they want to learn they are not brain damaged or emotionally disturbed they are normal people who have not had the opportunity for receiving the best possible pre college education And we feel that it's our responsibility to give them an opportunity to do that

Speaker 13 00:10:14.400
But what are some of the specific things you do in these first three semesters to take youngsters who are reading at the eighth grade a lower level and bringing them up to the level where they would function like any other college

Speaker 15 00:10:27.320
Well one of the things we do we for students having problems with language so far as the curriculum is concerned we break up the English requirement

Speaker 7 00:10:39.080
If I may use that term into smaller and more manageable units of work For instance we think of the English what would normally be an English language program We think of it in terms of requiring communication skills like writing skills interpretive skills like reading skills Basic the basic roots of language and understanding of the basic roots of language like grammar

Speaker 14 00:11:05.850
And then we have another course you have separate courses We have separate courses which which which you have a separate course and grammar which by intent to search by instead writing a separate course and reading

Speaker 7 00:11:16.680
However these courses are interwoven they are not it's not grammar as taught in a high school situation on an elementary school situation For instance we teach our grammar courses are built around the sentence We take the sentence and the attempt to familiarize the student with an understanding of the sentence and using that as a base we might help the student to understand something about the agreement between subject and verb how words within a sentence relate to each other so that we teach it in a in a in a text in which the student is involved all the time and in mastering the use of language

Speaker 15 00:11:51.040
Yes

Speaker 4 00:11:51.600
Well what about things like literature is the literature course a part of the academic development program or is that a part of the regular college B literature courses are part of the regular humanities division programs

Speaker 8 00:12:06.510
Any reading that the students might do within our program is simply as part of the instructional mode which we use Well do you take the literature at the same time as they take

Speaker 13 00:12:17.340
No they are not really permitted to because they're not ready they're not quite ready to let literature based on that those particular areas but I understand that throughout the city university and other universities including New York University there are a number of students who read adequately in terms of tests and so on but still have difficulty with understanding and at some schools they attempt to make available academic development or improvement courses for students who need to learn how to get the maximum right what they do read write is your program one that includes activities along these lines

Speaker 7 00:12:53.610
We do have an additional course which we call a language seminar and this is designed to help the student as he is acquiring the skills to integrate them Like not taking for instance many students can take notes in a class like research skills for instance many students cannot use a library or use the sources within a library

Speaker 3 00:13:14.130
What is the requirement for all students or is it no elective required It is a requirement for all students who score within a certain range on the intake testing that is students who score below a certain cutoff point They are required to take courses within the academic development division or what percentage of students take those I would say about fifty five percent of every incoming freshman class would need some of the work that we provide In addition to that I would also want to add that there are other things which happen we find for instance we use a different approach to counseling or that which is normally called counseling in a regular college program We've found that counseling is a very substantive component of direct instruction at Medgar Evers College The students who come to us by and large are well above 20 and most of them are adults They they bring job experiences They have a lot of economic needs Many of them are heads of families and we've found that the counseling need is different from that which would be required by an average 18 year old who is off to college and his parents are footing the bill

Speaker 14 00:14:29.700
Would you say that the counseling is an integral part of the educational program and it sounds like educational jargon Would you straighten that out and I would have explained to me exactly what you mean counseling fills three distinct roles within our division

Speaker 7 00:14:46.920
Counseling is looked upon as supportive teaching that is in some of our classrooms We have counselors who are in the classroom with the classroom teacher They do a tutor They take the class No they don't take the class They might be doing two things They their clients are assigned to them in a class by class basis They observe their clients function in the actual classroom situation and they are able to make some judgment as to areas in which their clients are weak in terms of subject matter The counselors off pretty familiar with the content of these courses and they even do tutoring in the classroom of some of these learners when the need arises so that we see counseling as what we call supportive teaching But we also see counseling as personal advisement what the counselor observes in the classroom provides a base for Counselor counselor discussion when the counselor or the student meets with his counselor the counsel is very well aware of what's going on in the classroom so that the student can't feed him a line He's aware of what's going on He's sensitive to it and he's better able to utilize his talents in helping

Speaker 14 00:16:01.130
So how how often does the counselor see the student Well actually the counselors and the students seeing each other is an ongoing process But that could be some students are not very aggressive and never see the counselor Well some are very aggressive and take a while to counselors time now If the students have a problem it would appear that there needs to be some type of planned interaction between the students and accounts

Speaker 7 00:16:22.180
There are periods of planned interaction that is when the student is There are times when students might request an assignment or an appointment and the other times when a student might be tardy on too often or he might be absent too often and the counselor requires the student to see him so that it works both ways

Speaker 13 00:16:41.060
What portion of your students are assigned counselors is what your counselor student ratio counselor student ratio within this division is about one to 65 and that by CUNY standards is quite low one to sixty five yes it's means that literally if a counsel saw a student once a day it has to go almost three months before they saw a counselor Yes close to that about maybe two months and a little But by having a counselor work with the classes of intact units you try to eliminate some of that Now is your division part of what's called the sik program

Speaker 16 00:17:20.890.0000000001164
So for education elevation and knowledge the the Sikh program as it's presently organized is what I define and I'm speaking for myself here is somewhat of an economic type program in the sense that people who come to the college from certain economic frame who need financial help are usually assigned to the C program

Speaker 8 00:17:49.090
The seek program does not of necessity deal with some of the kind of hard core language problems that we have to engage in on division Well some of the Sikh students for example in some of your courses there is a fairly good integration between some of the Sikh programs at Medgar Evers College and the academic debate because I know that one of the things that the Sikh program stresses we have had Dean Young of the city university is in charge of our program is counseling

Speaker 9 00:18:17.860
And I noticed that you also stress counseling that's the reason why I ask what the integration between the two Well let's turn to open enrollment now open enrollment is something that is relatively new since about 1971 or thereabouts in the city university and basically it establishes a principle that any graduate of a high school in New York City is entitled to attend college Now the open enrollment has been challenged very vigorously particularly with the suggestion that it has led to the lowering of standards within the city university because in the past the number of seats in the city university were allocated on the basis of high school average high school average wasn't of a certain magnitude You wouldn't really be able to get into the city university Well with the recognition of the fact as you said earlier that there are a large number of people were not have the opportunity through deprived education and other type problems to gain those skills to normally enter college The open enrollment boy opens them up right And a lot of the students that you deal with are students from these type of backgrounds They are open enrollment students right now What is your candid assessment of the impact of open enrollment on the general standards of the City University This is an issue that a number of people are concerned about and we recognize you're not speaking to the City University but we would like to know what your opinion is on this

Speaker 15 00:19:46.450
Well to be blunt if a school or a university to be more specific is a public institution the clear intent of the purpose of that organization the purpose of its continuing to exist is to serve its public the needs of that public should change This does not in any way reduce the responsibility of the university to serve all the members of that public And I believe that open enrollment is an opportunity for the City University because there were times when blind people were denied the opportunity to get a college education and the It took that resourceful teachers were pressed to design methods for reaching the blind or reaching the handicapped Well we are talking about people who are socially or otherwise handicapped And if it means that the City University got to develop more resourceful methods of instruction then that's the city university's responsibility We don't have any choice on this matter

Speaker 9 00:20:48.520
Yeah that's certainly your point I think all of us would agree with you I certainly identify with it but it does not address itself to the question Has the advent of open enrollment lowered the standards overall in the City University Obviously to give you a little cue on it if you take in students who are somewhat weaker the overall score average going to be lower

Speaker 11 00:21:11.070
But at this point Well I think the overall score average or median performance would be lower That is you taking a lower number Just writing your average but the question the general question is what about the standards You're not talking about the input you talking about the output What is your opinion on that

Speaker 15 00:21:25.650
The mere fact that we have been talking about what Medgar Evers College has been doing is indicative of our own concern to see to it that the highest possible standards of academic excellence are maintained at least within the programs of all of our college of our branch of the university and I think this is true of all of city universities

Speaker 7 00:21:47.070
We believe that if as I say people have different kinds of problems or different kind of handicaps or different kinds of needs once they have the skills or the resources for getting there even though it may take them longer even though it means we might have to use different methodologies for getting them there Their responsibility to get them there is not lessened and nor must we Nor are we doing them a service by attempting to lower standards

Speaker 11 00:22:16.590
Well then the question is what happens when they go out and take state board Licensing Examination I know in some instances the percentage of students who take an exam like nursing exams has declined over the years even though they have degrees now recognizing that they've gone a long way to get those degrees still How does this deal with helping these people to earn a living in their profession when their profession requires getting a certificate Does that mean I'm college has to do more or the exams had to be changed

Speaker 7 00:22:46.480
Well it doesn't mean the college have to do more and I'm glad you mentioned nursing because Medgar Evers College has one of the most effective nursing programs within CUNY and that's public knowledge In fact just recently some of our students were involved in taking the state boards and nursing and up to this point All the results look positive In other words US students are able to compete We are not preparing students to take second place among their peers We are preparing them to be top notch people

Speaker 17 00:23:16.260
I think that's the point that needs to be developed because the number of people have misinterpreted the opening of the doors of the City University to people who didn't previously get in And of course this led to some other problems And I might ask you what are some of the problems that open enrollment still faces Not just at Medgar Evers Best place you know most but also in general what do you perceive some of the problems I know one of them is that as the budget gets tighter there gets to be more pressure to limit opportunities rather than to expand opportunities But there are some other problems at open enrollment programs face What are some of them

Speaker 3 00:23:54.630
I think that I am going to express my own personal point of view on this matter

Speaker 15 00:24:00.480
We can only see education in the context in which the schools find themselves

Speaker 11 00:24:08.520
Way back in the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court that Plessy vs. Ferguson case Brown case the beyond the bounds of the one that made segregation illegal back in 1890 1896 that the Brown case desegregate Brown public school right

Speaker 15 00:24:24.240
Way back then I think that we saw initiated a move to provide for minority peoples equal opportunities in education There still remains within the country and within

Speaker 16 00:24:38.700
I am sure the city of New York is residues of my DC racial feeling with respect to some aspects of the open enrollment program We cannot avoid that It's there it exists but so far as I am concerned I feel that quite often there tends to be an attempt to treat open enrollment students like stepchildren

Speaker 15 00:25:06.060
We have not seen the whole university redesign itself in order to deal with this new public

Speaker 16 00:25:14.850
But we have rather seen this new public bent and twisted and attempts made to fit them in to a fixed pattern without that pattern itself changing significantly And I believe that eventually the college will be the gainer The university will be the gainer

Speaker 15 00:25:35.880
Might I say if some great attempts can be made reorient the whole machinery of teaching and learning so that the college begins to The university begins to address itself significantly to the whole scope of the problem of open enrollment students

Speaker 3 00:25:54.220
I think Medgar Evers College has been doing that and I believe that some of the things we are doing at the college could well serve as a model

Speaker 9 00:26:00.130
I know one of the things you've emphasized his adult education and there probably are people in the audience who might want to get in touch with the college both about entering the college as freshmen or entering the adult education programs And I thought it might be useful to give the telephone number What is the telephone number of a college And whom should they contact

Speaker 10 00:26:21.730
Well there are several persons that could contact I think that if a person is seeking admission to the college any admissions office will be a place to start If they are looking for information of a general nature the public relations division is another place to start If they are looking for faculty kinds of information the Dean of Faculty Office is a good place to begin

Speaker 11 00:26:42.310
But there's one number they can call

Speaker 10 00:26:43.630
There is one number named in court as that and that number is area code 2 1 2 of course 4 9 3 3 6 4 1 I'll repeat that number That's 4 9 3 3 6 4 1 is a general number at the college and they can then contact whoever they wish to reach through that number

Speaker 9 00:27:03.010
I see I think you have explained very clearly what Medgar Evers was trying to do and what your division in particular is trying to do One thing that you didn't have a chance to mention and very briefly was because the program

Speaker 16 00:27:17.410
Could you indicate what the college is doing to reach the community it to begin with Medgar Evers College is one of those unique universities which which has a a community board and a college doesn't have a board that serves as a kind of advisory body to the president And in fact is very much involved in the daily life of the college

Speaker 9 00:27:43.960
Okay And I know that the college does run a number of programs right In the community I would like to thank our guests Dr. Roderick Loney chairman of the academic development division at Medgar Evers College of the city university for discussing with us open enrollment and the various things that are being done to make education relevant to black and Puerto Rican youth in the city Thank you
