Speaker 1 00:00:14.080
This is Soul of reason they program Tell us what's happening in black America Each week on NBC leaders and movers in the black community visit soul of reason to discuss important issues of concern to blacks about the Americas I am your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Brown's Community College of the City University of New York Our guest on this evening sole reason is Donald Cogswell who's president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation HQ D.C. and we're going to be talking about some of the things that this very important organization is doing to improve housing and economic conditions in Harlem We're glad to have you with us tonight Don Thank you

Speaker 2 00:00:57.010
Could you tell our audience a little about the origin of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation what its purposes are and how it is chartered and then from there we can talk about some of the things that you're doing

Speaker 3 00:01:08.330
Yeah well the Urban Development Corporation came by in the early 70s it mainly came about as a community concern about the building of state office building site which meant in order to build that for so they had to turn down a series of quite a few local businesses The community then had a convention and one of the things they wanted to do was have a corporation concentrating in Harlem whose function would be similar to the New York State Urban Development Corporation that is to provide various kinds of services to the Harlem community mainly for housing commercial redevelopment industrial as well as civic facilities all right to refresh the minds of our memories of our audience in the state office building at Hall in Harlem at a 25th Street Seventh Avenue is probably the only state facility in Harlem

Speaker 2 00:02:04.460
It's about 22 stories It's about 19 stories tall building tallest building around right And at the time it was promoted by Governor Rockefeller sort of a redevelopment and a reawakening of Harlem Now some of the Harlem residents became a little disturbed about this particular some of the business people who had been occupying the stretch Lane 124 street for a long period of time

Speaker 1 00:02:28.780
And they actually took over the property and they what do they call that It was a city I forget but the squatters squatters City restaurant over and for at least six eight months maybe even a year That's right

Speaker 4 00:02:42.040
They delayed the development of the property And finally I guess the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and some of the other socially related activities it came out of that were organized and the building moved ahead it had a black architect I think the firm was eyeful and Johnson That's right And they designed it and had as many minority contractors as they could get help develop it And right now in 1978 I guess most people have sort of forgotten about the controversy and the building is widely used It's probably the place in Harlem now where many many events take place meetings social events Senator McCall has his office there Some of the other congressmen congresspeople Charles Rangel has an office there And it's just interesting how things happen Yet the balance of the property other than the area where the building stands on the north end of the real estate western property over one hundred twenty fifth and seventh is still vacant and one of the things I guess say to D.C. wants to deal with is what are you going to do about the rest of that property and some of the other thing

Speaker 2 00:03:55.340
So maybe with that as a background you can sort of bring us up to date on where you're going What How are you now building on this mandate this charge that you have

Speaker 3 00:04:07.850
Well what we're trying to do in terms of commercial activity and really have to define two distinct areas one is residential one is commercial although they they work together they complement each other but they're distinct functions Hundred twenty fifth Street is the spine and we're talking about between St. Nicholas all the way down to Fifth Avenue The one the most important sites is the eastern portion of the state office building site was at Lenox and around 25th Street That's right next to the state office building It's 70000 square feet and mainly vacant except one building on on a corner We have For a period of time looking at various development ideas The difficulty is that that is a kind of the site which would could accommodate a very significant development program such as a hotel or convention center a shopping center a whole series of larger things

Speaker 5 00:05:06.290
And it has the advantage of the fact that it's vacant spaces There is no who is right and has to take place here to stop building the Right

Speaker 3 00:05:14.150
Money right on the main subway line I mean it's just a magnificent location What is started Well actually in December is the parking facility with commercial space that has broke ground is similar twenty second I believe And what our plans are is to build on that hopefully with the hotel convention center maybe International Trade Center or a development like that The problem is that kind of a development costs a considerable amount of money And we need private sector involvement So in the meantime the build up to that site what we're doing is a series of smaller projects hopefully to create a positive atmosphere to get people to invest in the Harlem community One of the most important is the relocation the street merchants as you remember of probably being there hundreds and hundreds a year ago like I that the street merchants were located on the sidewalk between Adam and Frederick Douglass Boulevard on Huntington history Now they're no longer there They have been relocated And what we had planned to do with the city was develop a public market in that same block to house the merchants as a permanent facility That kind of development programs are the things which hopefully sends the right signals out to the private lending institutions that the federal government the city that we're really doing something about it being the street merchants

Speaker 4 00:06:43.290
This is like the old African street market or the old European street market where emotions just come and put their wares out in this album Now one of the reasons why people get upset is one thing they obstructed the so-called permanent businesses the others that may have people get ripped off because there's no control there's no consumer control except that of the man on the street And when you don't know what you're buying you you got a tough problem and I understand you folks have taken some leadership to help try to bring that into some kind of control What success have you had with that

Speaker 3 00:07:17.690
Well the merchants over the last several years have really changed the business practices I mean I think now if you buy some goods from them you'll find out it's faulty you can return it And in fact it was it's very active a lot of people come and go and purchase from them We work with the Uptown Chamber of Commerce with their Harlem Commonwealth council in the relocation of the merchants But the the interesting thing we did a movie on that on on the street where they were located we found out the people walk down the street but from the merchants but they also went inside the established businesses and it was an air that was created by them Kind of a social interesting area that we think and what we're trying to do is capture that in a permanent street market which the city has agreed to work with us on but was not a part of the the budget of the Mayor presented not too long ago We're kind of upset about that because we think that is a significant step to start a redevelopment effort but it is a the merchants create a atmosphere of shopping I think it is very stimulating well now as you begin to look at this development one of the problems about Harlem or any black community whether it's been disinvestment is to get reinvestment

Speaker 2 00:08:40.870
You know corporations like Harlem Urban Development huge quasi public corporations which have some state funding or at least access to some state funding can help move things along that really isn't going to substitute for a massive infusion of private capital That's right And that really is the double edged sword that you have to work with On one hand you have sort of a conduit for state funds On the other hand you're supposed to perform a catalytic role to help get the private sector involved in Harlem and Harlem has had a really great history but recently I guess you'd have to call it a checkered history in that many of the things that are happening in parts of ocean out Brownsville and parts of the South Bronx with people walking away from buildings It's beginning to happen in Harlem something I've never expected to have see happen How do you in your capacity as a director how do you conceive of the role of AQ D.C. in helping to sort of keep Harlem from falling apart Because I think when people begin to walk away from their real property as well as begin to walk away from their businesses that a community is beginning to become unglued And despite all of the the deprivation in Harlem and things that people like Langston Hughes wrote about James Baldwin Harlem did have an intake and I say still has an integrity it is a community But the more houses that get closed up and the little businesses move away the less it will be a community How do you perceive your role in that

Speaker 6 00:10:24.250
Well on the government's own first play saying it should be clear then I can't think I do not know of any urban communities such as Harlem that can be developed without A substantial amount of public support Federal City State whatever it is and what we have to do that hasn't been done in the past is joint partnership with that public sector with the private sector the public sector and the private sector come together is really what you're talking about the redevelopment areas Now what I mentioned with the Street Market Street merchants facility there is a series of facilities like that which we think are the first steps to try and get the private sector to understand that if you were invest money into the Harlem community on a high and 25th Street or into our neighborhoods the government's going to back it up and hopefully make that investment a real investment for you I mean the private sector's thing about not how they can give money away but how they can invest in and getting back Recently we just purchased the Loews Theater want to convert that into a series of many theaters maybe five stages to try to create that that atmosphere that the private sector is going to see some people coming on to her in 2050 And if they make the investment they'll be able to get it back

Speaker 1 00:11:41.420
Now when you say you purchased it that means the corporation the corporation did That's right Is this with state money or is this a combination of state and private money

Speaker 6 00:11:50.180
This is mainly with with state money and fact we're looking for private and public money to redevelop the theater we're talking to various troops which there are many out there now gone down to 40 seconds we will should be to Harlem see the future of the urban centers is going to be how they can attract tourism back into the community what the old city follows forgotten is that Harlem was a real asset to the city of New York it carried its weight and clearly carried his way by getting people to come into the community and in doing that they purchase than they did just like to go to Chinatown and you go wherever Harlem was I think at the head of the list in terms of places that people want to see right now we still have buses coming in from from Europe France Germany wherever riding up the volume they ride and they don't stop

Speaker 5 00:12:41.660
Yeah from older his age right now leave and spend money we have to come up with a way to get him to stop and that's what our program is all about

Speaker 6 00:12:49.880
Our organization has tried to come up with those development programs to get them stop Now you might have heard recently about the spruce up program on in the neighborhoods in which we're investing money into the facades of houses Surely it's a cosmetic kind of treatment as a result of that we've found that people are starting to stay in in their blocks houses which were vacant are now being rehabbed in some cases we have in fact we rehabbing some of the blocks with buildings with various organizations We have a list of people want to buy the salad brownstones which we don't think would have happened Unless the government took that first step the government takes a small first step But in doing that I think it will save them substantial amount of money in the long run And anything you can do to stabilize a neighborhood is what we're all about preserve and stabilize and to rebuild wherever we can The same with the end the commercial development

Speaker 7 00:13:49.940
What about the allegation that as you let the government make our decisions for us in the black community that we lose any power that we have to control our community That's a frequently stated objection to government involvement Yet you've made a very clear case that if the community is going to be safe it has to be significantly larger investment of the government and I have I guess was almost the identical argument on state office building The argument that Rockefeller made was that book I put in a state facility here would cause people to come to Harlem and build up the business And at that time you recall they wouldn't put a lot of state agencies where they own only office in New York City was going to be a state office building Well some of the I had yes after say at some of the white workers objected to this And so as a result they weaseled plus the fact that another thing is a built the World Trade Center which is still about a third empty or whatever it is in terms of state facilities So it's part of the edifice complex that almost every large government has heard the Rockefeller administration was really renowned for that between the Rockefeller mall and Albany and the World Trade Center and state office building and a few others

Speaker 8 00:14:59.100
We've got lots of edifices but nonetheless the argument was huge in a sense is the argument you making that by making this massive or I shouldn't say a massive large public investment in a facility in Harlem it would attract people

Speaker 7 00:15:15.420
Now some people are saying this really is sort of ripping off the black community and we're losing control of our community How do you answer that Well I think the big thing is the and Development Corporation is unique in itself and that on the board we have a broad spectrum of the people of the community

Speaker 6 00:15:33.690
All the elected officials aren't on board It's chaired by Herb Evans judge Herb Herbert Evans You have Congress Rangel Center McCall you I mean you have you have all the elected officials Then you have the very important people from the religious segment of our community organ community organization et cetera And in doing that the funds which come in four through the public sector is really channeled to some way through our corporation or in participation with other corporations And I think that's the way we have to go But there's no doubt about it There's no way to make a person or an organization institutions comfortable with making an investment unless they understand that whatever they're going to do is gonna be backed up by somebody and that somebody has to be the government in a way to control that is make the vehicle one which is responsive to the community

Speaker 7 00:16:29.090
That's where Harlem Urban Development Corporation is all about because you almost like saying the government is the employer or the builder of last resort Are you saying the government has to build a first resort right now

Speaker 3 00:16:40.520
Depends on where you would you think about lucky because that's the point The government is the largest spender and in an America And what we're talking about now is give us a little bit of those public funds so we can attract the private funds and there's no other way to do it I can't think of one community throughout America that can do it solely on their own

Speaker 1 00:17:03.780
I don't I don't so the reason we are talking with Donald Cogswell who's president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation in front of me here I have a report which you call the Harlem two year development plan which you develop in February of 77 How far along the way are you in terms of this two year development program Some very nice words about Harlem it's unique symbolizes the hopes and aspirations

Speaker 8 00:17:27.140.00000000011642
Let's say for American people and I think that's right And they say it has a mystique that parallels that of Chinatown and just go New York's Little Italy and so on But now we again and the dots I know at one time when I first came to Harlem I sort of did some studies to figure out about how much it would cost to make Harlem into the type of community where people had good housing and good schools and so on And it ran up into several hundred billion dollars What's your price tag for your two year program

Speaker 6 00:18:04.430
Well that's very difficult What we see are Maybe three or four important bankers to get some investment going We're looking at a Harlem residents spend about 175 million dollars annually and department store type goods of which only about one hundred million dollars is retained within a community 75 million dollars to the community Now what we would like to do is develop a shopping center with a full line department store to try to arrest some of that export sales potential The eastern portion the state office building as I mentioned before is another large kind of involvement We think that we had those two developments What's happening in the middle and what can happen further east of 100 hundred of Fifth Avenue will be significant in terms of the private investment so it's very difficult to tell exactly how much we're talking about It could be 25 million it could be 30 million Clearly it's in that range But what sparks the people and get them involved interest in investing is what we're all about and we want to do that as a lower price tag as we possibly can And we think these two kinds of large developments we'll get that kind of investment

Speaker 8 00:19:31.010
Well there is a prototype you just take the 86 street car Yes Gamble's decided to go to 86 Street and Lexington people raise hell And they said they weren't going to have it And now you find another burgeoning community All kinds of restaurants all kinds of boutiques all kind of tall apartment buildings et cetera

Speaker 2 00:19:50.180
Now it's true that they are appealing to a predominant white probably upper class upper middle class clientele But it would appear that the same kind of investment would take place in Harlem a Corvettes for example could locate I just mentioned Corvettes it could be a Macy's it could be any one of several stores it could be Kmart which is a coast based chain coming in and say Are we going to make our building now placing an anchor I know in the Bronx We're trying to do the same thing with Fordham Plaza We going to get an anchor to help anchor the community economically because it is true that particularly in what used to be the urban shopping centers they have now fallen apart because either new shopping malls downtown such as in the 86 Street or the Bloomingdale's area or they've just hop on the parkway and drive up to the county Santa or drive out to Green Acres But generally speaking people respond to convenience and if in fact the neighborhood could have an anchor have a good store quality store well it would not the rip off prices that used to be associated with Harlem because one reason why a lot of people did leave Harlem is that a year ago in the absence of consumer controls many times it did get ripped off And the suggestion was you wouldn't go anywhere else It almost kind of an arrogance I think it's pretty much of learn that black people yellow people or any other kind of people are going to stand up for their consumer rights when they find out the problem and pass has been getting information to people So what are some of the possibilities you have I know did you involved in negotiation may not want to mention specific names but are you talking with Have you gotten any real nibbles from substantial business organizations that might want to invest in some type of new development in Harlem

Speaker 6 00:21:49.620
Oh yes very much so in fact the Harlem Commonwealth council who we are partnership on a on a new shopping center was calling Corporation which is a very large development firm Haven't I talked to series of various department stores and I think the numbers have been very encouraging and that we hopefully within a three or four month period may be able to say to the to the to the country that we have something that makes sense for our entire office with a full line department store Now you're right Once that happens then I think the signals and everything starts to change and the climate starts to change And therefore we'll get the kind of investment like like 86 street there's no different I I think in fact once that's done it will be a one very important asset to New York City in general I mean people talk about unemployment talked about welfare and time all those kinds of things That's what it's all about to somehow harness that money that's leaving our community hopefully bring some additional money in our community and create those kinds of jobs And if we can get one two even three developers coming up we're serious about making an investment

Speaker 4 00:23:09.360
I think that that development team is going to be paid off handsomely and I'm going gonna ask you a question that really is sort of a double edged question in that in New York City we have a number of communities that are struggling for survival We have Harlem We have a South Bronx We have Bedford Stuyvesant We have ocean hill we have Jamaica South Jamaica and we all saying that the public should put money into this now because of President Carter's visit to the Bronx which is where I work now

Speaker 2 00:23:43.230
Charlotte Street became the prototype of urban degradation and they put all kind of money in there and they now have the South Bronx task force and hopefully certain things going to happen We're gonna begin to try to turn the Bronx around The Bronx was selected because this business of housing abandonment probably took its greatest fall on that particularly combined with the awesomeness which fortunately has not really moved that much in the hall that's right This particular And trying to draw the line keep from happening But when you look at you the mayor or you are the planner for New York City you look at the economic needs of the various communities A theory is developed which is called a triage theory put the money into the neighborhoods that are on the borderline of falling off the brink and sort of forget the ones that are really way off On the other hand I'm from the Bronx and I'm saying I don't want that to happen I want the money to go in the Bronx right now A considerable portion of it because we've gone so far down the path that unless we take this out the Bronx will be one big parking lot which is what people are talking about I don't believe it will I believe but one of the things about real estate is even though it not houses on the banks own the land and the banks aren't really about to lose all of their money and in a sense because of the redlining practices the banks in part are responsible for their own error by their disinvestment as right How do you see your package to D.C. package in the context the whole urban development problem in the city

Speaker 6 00:25:20.910
Well I think that it's very difficult to compare to other other places I mean Harlem is a historic community internationally known articles written upon it in a National Geographic the first time a community has been written up in National Geographic I mean it holds a little different place and the history of black people the history of of New York the history of America in general I think that what we have is also different in that we're not building from the getting up there is a base in Harlem There are people living there There are houses that are just magnificent There is an active center commercial strip 124 street I think that if somebody wants to make a mark they can make a very small investment If you compare to other communities and really get a huge return that's the politicians the the private investor or whatever

Speaker 9 00:26:24.440
So I don't think we're talking about one location in New York as opposed to another location where I think we the American people have the capacity to develop our cities I think we have to start looking more towards what's happening in America than what's happening abroad to some degree I think we have to start thinking about maybe tanks and bombs aren't the best in the world but something for human beings in areas like Harlem is the best and I think whoever that president is is going to seriously announce an urban policy is going to be the one that can really change this country around And I think we have the capacity to do both There's no reason the South Bronx should be a parking lot All right

Speaker 7 00:27:09.580
How would people in the audience get in touch with Harlem Urban Development Corporation What's your address What your phone number and what kind of help me you need on Main Street

Speaker 9 00:27:17.930
Other than investment isn't it Well first we're at 163 w 224 history on 17th for our telephone numbers 6 7 8 2 5 7 9 The person he speak to his temple Gene Harris who is our public relations officer And basically what we need is support from people who are interested in trying to help us in the overall development

Speaker 10 00:27:50.780
I'm sure we need money but we also need people who are interested to tell our local politicians to tell the mayor to tell the governor that we ought to think about trying to do something about that historic community called home What do you think about the impact of the reopening of the Apollo Theater The Cotton Club and mainly those two in terms of bringing attention to Harlem is out I think personally it's a positive thing

Speaker 9 00:28:19.400
What what impact has it had to date I said I think I don't know if you noticed but the old Apollo when it was in his boom time used to have the stores were open whenever the Apollo was open it was part of the economic fabric of the street I think the same thing is happening now I see that Eartha Kitt is going to be coming very soon James Brown's coming very soon and that gets the activity and the people moving back up and down in 20 fist Same thing with the cotton crop And we need more of the the Jazeera's coming back

Speaker 11 00:28:55.190
The interest in I think Harlem is coming back and I think those two facilities in particular are very important to the community

Speaker 12 00:29:03.620
What about crime is crime on decrease in Harlem Things are getting better there they're about the same growth That's a very difficult One

Speaker 11 00:29:13.970
To to figure out I have not noticed as many crowds as we used to out in the streets I think There is not as much crime going on as as used to be going on and I think there is a little bit more attention should be paid by the by the city administration to try to figure out what to do on this issue to stop in particular some of the dope killing out of the examiner right That should not be stopped right That's right

Speaker 12 00:29:39.050
All right tonight until the reason we've been talking with Donald J COGSWELL who's president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and we've been talking about some of their plans for redeveloping one of the great landmarks of America
