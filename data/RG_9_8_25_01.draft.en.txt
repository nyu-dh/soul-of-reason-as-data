Speaker 1 00:00:00.820
But there were many of them however unwinding is just an excuse

Speaker 2 00:00:05.350
Yeah I'm standing by Um if you want to help me

Speaker 3 00:00:10.720
With that

Speaker 2 00:00:27.530
Take it straight up Roscoe's stand by I got a kind of lengthy statement about this the soul of reason a program that tells what's happening in black America

Speaker 4 00:00:48.940
Each week on NBC Leaders and movers in the black community visit soul of reason to discuss important concerns of black New Yorkers I am your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York And with us this evening is our guest is Mr. Charles T

Speaker 5 00:01:09.670
Chuck Williams vice president of Shanley affiliated brands Corporation and member the board of the Jackie Robinson Foundation and Chuck I'm really glad to have you with us this evening Thank you for inviting me Roscoe Well let's tell the audience about the J.R. foundation obvious everybody knows about Jackie Robinson one of the great great Americans of our time

Speaker 6 00:01:30.070
But tell us about this foundation if you would please Joe while the foundation was established in the memory of Jackie ROOSEVELT ROBINSON WAS entry into the Major League Baseball established a precedent for the entry of blacks into multiple facets fields of American sports through his skills and talent He made it possible for many black Americans to avail themselves of opportunity in the world of sports previously not open to them He later developed his talents and energies to struggle for social economic and political justice for all the millions of Americans I think you could say he brought hope and opportunity gross you know his primary concern centered around the plight of black and poor children and their families it's probably no wonder that he focused his efforts on assisting minority and economically deprived children He really wanted to provide financial support for an access to educational and recreational opportunities and he wanted to create the cultural awareness of these children and to enhance their ability to attend attain better education and ultimately be have a better way of life He wanted to provide supplemental education and record recreation guidance for them as well And he believed that the program for blacks must be linked to community efforts in an effort to develop a system of self-help and service He felt only through these efforts could the blacks help to elevate themselves to the morass and find a better and more healthy way of life

Speaker 7 00:03:16.220
So if I could interrupt at this point I think the audience should know that Jackie Robinson spent a great deal of his time and effort and life working with two organizations We both know one is the NAACP at one time Jackie was the principal fundraiser for the NAACP when things were really really tough when the NAACP was in the trenches needing the money Well as various civil rights struggles that eventually culminated in the Civil Rights Act and the other is the Harlem YMCA For years Jackie was one of the leaders in attracting funds and programs to the Harlem y on w 130 history so that I think what you have to say about Jackie in terms of his social contributions is really very significant because I guess nothing in really cap his being the first black to enter professional baseball and really open up the field for professional basketball and football as well because that is just something happens once in a lifetime But beyond being a great ballplayer Hall of Fame ballplayer Jackie was a tremendous man in terms of what he did and what he believed in in terms of helping black Americans and thereby by helping all Americans

Speaker 8 00:04:34.070
Well I think he turned the whole social system around When he went into baseball because I feel that were as you said once in a lifetime a man like this comes along and helped with his attitude and his drive and his sincerity he was able to make white America I'm sure very conscious of their hideous acts of just eliminating a good ballplayer from playing for their entertainment And it's amazing to think back over the years that after a while when he got into baseball they forgot that he was black

Speaker 9 00:05:08.120
They just looked at him as a good ballplayer and they also thought he was a troublemaker because just like Jack stood up for the rights of blacks he stood up for the rights of his teammates And whenever there was something that he thought was going against the Brooklyn Dodgers and Jack was the first one out of the dugout

Speaker 7 00:05:25.130
And as you say he was dealt with at that point not as a black ballplayer but as a ballplayer who was fighting for the rights of his team And I guess it's ironical but I guess it's not that And picking Jackie Robinson Branch Rickey selected a person who was not only going to be a great leader in the baseball field but a great leader of society And it really is tragic that Jackie left us so soon when he was still in the peak of his fighting years in terms of fighting for racial and social justice

Speaker 8 00:05:58.820
You know Martin Luther King's that is better to live 30 years and attain something than live 100 and do nothing with the roses I'm sure he has attitude to it because he was constantly on the go helping people wherever we could And I have met many men in my lifetime and at my age I'm sure you can say that but I've never met a man that was as dedicated and as honest as this man was

Speaker 9 00:06:22.430
And the one thing about Jackie because we both knew him well to get in an argument with Jackie and see Jackie yes dig in the sand and he may have been dead wrong Jackie mobilized all of his resources at all of that had it and put up a very formidable position and most of the time as we well know in terms of social issues he wasn't dead wrong because basically he identified with the concerns of the masses and that's something that there are not too many black leaders who really are the leaders of any type who can really identify with the masses And I think Jackie you probably as much as anybody I know and have known identified with the masses So this brings us to the foundation

Speaker 8 00:07:05.860
Well let me Foundation itself let me bring you bring up the whole story that a little lonely piggyback on what you said when Robert Kennedy I mean when Jack Kennedy was getting there beginning to run for president he called Jack down and asked him if he would support him in his run for the presidency

Speaker 10 00:07:23.360
So he said Senator let me look at your record he said You've been a senator for 14 years and he says you've never done anything for black people so Senator Kennedy said Well I'm sorry I haven't ever had the opportunity to know He said Well Senator if your age if you haven't had an opportunity to know him it's a little late to start right now But I mean that was the sort of guy he was now after Jack became Jack Kennedy became president He said he was wrong in his assessment of it but he at that point he said that this was the only direction he could go into

Speaker 11 00:07:56.880
Now that's the that I'm talking about of Jack believed them He believed it and he stood right up and he was counted A lot of people believe things that you know behind the table behind the door But many came up to being counted They didn't they weren't counted And Jack was out there being counted And I think the idea of a foundation is really a fantastic tribute to Jackie because we really don't have too many foundations oriented to promoting the deep concerns of black people They really are very very few

Speaker 12 00:08:27.310
Could you tell us a little something about the board of the Foundation who is involved in this and then we'll get around to the purpose of it while the board is composed of Martin Stone who is old and dear friend of Jack's and at one time was in charge of the was in charge of the World's Fair for New York Marion Logan you know who is now sitting as some are equal rights commissioner for the city Andrea Simon who is also a very close friend Her husband was the I was one of the publishers of Simon and Schuster David Robinson his youngest son who is doing a great job of his own and housing rehabilitation Howard Cosell the Sports Writer Sports commentator who were often meeting with Martin Edelman who is an attorney Jesse Jackson from Chicago would push Robert lip with the Chase Manhattan Bank Sidney Poitier We all know as an actor Tom Valenti from BBDO no Frank Williams who is an ambassador to to Africa and now head of the film Dope Foundation

Speaker 11 00:09:42.970
And of course myself at the very very prestigious board A matter of fact you to be able to go a long way with that boy Now specifically what are the objectives of the foundation

Speaker 13 00:09:53.830
Well it for at the present time we have some students and in college through the support of the cheeseburger foundation we have four I think in there at this present time The purpose of the foundation really is to take young children from the age of 10 to 18 which is their formative years and see where we can see where we can support them by financial support technical support whatever support that is needed is proposed that we acquire a distinct and functional facilities in New York to be named the Jackie Robinson Jackie Robinson house This will be used to house the center of important thing so children and their families can visit this thing and see what what people are doing what black people are doing to upgrade themselves There will be a summer intern program each summer beginning in 1978 The foundation plans to sponsor the Jackie Roberts summer Jackie Robinson summer intern program This program would choose approximately 50 high school students who have demonstrated a concern for people and a potential for community leadership They will be sent to Washington D.C. for an orientation program concerning social activism in America and where they will be working with the government At the conclusion of their work the Robison intern would be elected assignments to various civil rights labor and community organizations in their respective locales for on the job training Following up the placements would be negotiated for the winter interns to be given high priority for scholarship assistance

Speaker 11 00:11:42.190
Now in terms of setting up with internship program which is a fantastic idea I would assume that some of the congresspeople and some of the advocacy organizations in Washington have agreed to accept these interns Is that correct

Speaker 13 00:11:56.830
Oh I'm sure there would be no problem getting them accepted The problem today is that most young people have been turned off by they've been alienated by things as going around a man Well we at the foundation feel it's time to develop some sort of a social reawakening and consciousness on the part of people so young people today so they can become become involved in social activism and helping young people you know in the 60s This was a great thing for them but they've since then they've dropped out of it

Speaker 11 00:12:31.460
But part of that might be just the reaction of all people particularly black kids to Watergate and to the total dishonesty in some parts of government In addition of which I imagine a number of young people are very alienated from government because despite the promises of Carter to produce jobs for people particularly young people this promise has not materialized

Speaker 14 00:13:02.980
And you know just recently Jimmy Carter was up in the South Bronx and as he was talking about what he's going to do when the kid came on over his shoulder and said What we need is jobs man jobs And I think when you find a young people regardless of their socioeconomic status thing that government thing a president promised something and then not deliver it does tend to give a certain amount of cynicism

Speaker 11 00:13:28.840
And then when you go to the deepest of depth when you see the extent to which Nixon and his buddies went in Watergate and all of the related concerns it does tend to make you wonder about how much young people would want to become involved in government I know Jackie's position was that you have to be there and he said many times you know you may not like it here but it's the country we got And this is what we gotta do to try to straighten it out And I think there is some some reason why kids might be somewhat turned off Do you have any particular way in mind of reaching the young people that you want to become involved with Is there any mechanism that you have as any core body of people who are working with you on this at this point in time

Speaker 12 00:14:14.740
Well the problem Let me go back just a minute to what you were talking about Roscoe the problem as I see it as a dedication to young people to make them feel a part of the society especially black youth

Speaker 15 00:14:28.490
They have been so alienated throughout the years that they develop a sixth sense like a dog has when he runs into a person that doesn't like him And unless we can get the school system let's just take that for example because that's where we start from and we can get the teachers and the school system to try to work with the children to teach them instead of just becoming SWAT officers or officers there to keep them quiet They were never going to be able to move this thing ahead We envision taking these young students that we put through this intern program and letting them work in the field to help the students develop themselves because you have to have self-awareness before you can develop yourself You can develop that self-awareness which started many years ago when they said black is beautiful all of a sudden there was a movement to make few people feel that they were worthy of something themselves Today as I look at the school system there are many kids who are coming out that can't read So how do you get a job if you can't read These are part of the programs that we will address ourselves to the self-awareness would be the key one where kids would not only where they would not only help the students in their school but help them develop their self-awareness tonight

Speaker 16 00:15:42.110
And so the reason we are talking with Charles T Chuck Williams vice president of Chantilly affiliate brands member the board of the Jackie Robinson Foundation and a longtime friend and acquaintance of Jackie Robinson We're talking about why this foundation is so important and you just said Chuck that the whole business of developing a positive self image and thinking that one is important is really the key Now there are a number of groups that try to do this The Y tries to do it The boys clubs of America tries to do it The boy scouts tries to do it

Speaker 17 00:16:18.590
Jesse Jackson tries to do it through push some school systems try to do it but somehow or another it hasn't developed a large enough following I was in a public school series of public schools the other day and I saw all over the school the sign It's cool to be smart and I said to myself and I walked into a It's a pretty cool idea Those kids must really must be together And then when I looked into it further I found out that it was the superintendent of his school and his principals

Speaker 14 00:16:55.010
They came up with the idea of trying to help young people young black kids mainly to internalize this idea that using the brain and thinking and reading and counting is just as important as being able to you know do the latest hustle step or to be able to do stuff in basketball or whatever

Speaker 16 00:17:16.430.0000000001164
The the in sports thing is and that type of thing that begins to develop image Now when you talk about the role of your foundation now the J.R. foundation Jackie around the foundation how do you think your activities are the activities of this foundation will go toward making it cool to be smart or improving the image of the young people

Speaker 13 00:17:38.030
Well I think in our first first first you must have someone who's really interested and dedicated and taking Jack's taking Jack's background and trying to duplicate it among younger kids would be the first step

Speaker 15 00:17:54.810
They in turn would then try to pass this on You know you have so many kids to reach It almost looks like an impossible situation And to most people I guess they would say was impossible but we cannot afford to lose a whole another whole generation of kids So we felt that we would take start with a 50 and see what we could do with them and see how this thing develops so that we might make them a make the kids feel that there was someone out there that was interested in their welfare

Speaker 18 00:18:20.460
Now with these say you start at 50 young people now will these be of high school age I believe any of them be high school and high school and young college

Speaker 16 00:18:29.040
And with this nucleus which would include some money for education I guess for this internship with this nucleus you would hope to be able to expand this concept to more and more

Speaker 15 00:18:42.580
Yeah absolutely But you have to start with a smaller group because they have to understand what it's all about and like all mass movements it's never started by a whole lot of people have started by a few people cause you raise an interesting point

Speaker 16 00:18:55.230
This is an issue that foundation executives often wonder about when you start a program is it better to put a lot of resources into a few people or a few resources into many people And apparently you are taking a critical mass approach name it a critical mass is a few dedicated people with ample resources to be able to learn and acquire the skills and the images that you want them to acquire and then hopefully the multiplier effect factor will take over that they will influence two more people each and somebody else influence two more people out of the 50 you might end up influencing or 5000 people as that's a concept you have in mind

Speaker 13 00:19:35.400
That's actually that's exactly the concept we felt at once that we could get many of the athletes interested in the foundation and strange it may seem most of them who at the present time over I would say oh there they are living the jack

Speaker 19 00:19:50.340
I've been I've been almost they've been almost impossible to reach Case in point one of the ball clubs lot of players on the ball clubs donated some money to the foundation and of all the players on there came up with one hundred and forty two dollars which was almost ludicrous

Speaker 15 00:20:08.520
Well but again we don't have we're not aware of what our social social activism should be we're not aware what we should do

Speaker 19 00:20:15.810
Doing as black people all other nationalities and ethnic groups work within their own group to achieve something but most of us those of us who are at a certain point in life fear we have it made and the one thing about Jack and his book and which was his last words before he died he will say it even at the point that before his death I never had it made because because he never I felt he had it made into the lowest person on a totem pole was able to lift up their head with pride

Speaker 20 00:20:44.790
Well that's true As a matter of fact Sometimes I give lectures to young people I talk about Jackie Robinson and then all of a sudden I realize that Jackie started playing ball in the Major League in 1947 and some of these youngsters weren't born at that time And then I say do you know who Jackie Robinson was And if 15 20 percent know who Jackie Robinson was That's a lot Yet everybody knows who Muhammad Ali is that then I try out Willie mays about about half of whom Willie Mays was which shows that sports fame in a sense is fleeting

Speaker 16 00:21:18.940
You know it also shows that people who are the key people in history are frequently overlooked and forgotten I guess that's the reason why you have days like Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's birthday and a memorial to Jefferson and Franklin and so on because it's so easy to forget one's heritage And then of course in the case of black athletes today who are making one hundred and fifty thousand dollars right out of high school or right out of college out of a year they really do believe as they do they really don't feel that they owe it to anybody They feel that they are so good and the society that burns up sports heroes needs them so badly that it's their do and that is the reason why a group like the Jackie Robinson Foundation is necessary to help them understand that it's not their do and quite honestly all they have to do is look around Major League Baseball and see that today there are no black major league managers and they should know pretty darn well exactly where they stand in the hierarchy of at least the sport of baseball

Speaker 21 00:22:27.150
But we also know Roscoe you know a lot of kids are are gearing themselves for for professional sports and unfortunately they're not gonna be that many spaces open for them that unfortunately it's a dead certain Well no So now what you have to think about is what direction to put city channel efforts into so that if they don't make the before professional sports arena that at least they can make a living for themselves and they it's pretty hard to make them understand that there's not therefore I'm not going to be there for all of them And another interesting fact you know they say that these kids can't learn yet I'm sure that you talk to any kid thought of basketball and I hope he can tell you percentages of basketball players he can tell you percentages of any kind So So he has a mathematical mind to start with that they say they can learn and this is an amazing thing to me and this is one of the things that upsets me

Speaker 16 00:23:17.090
Yeah I think most people in education are aware of the fact that anyone can learn it's question what kind of environment they are placed in and what you expect them to learn this time of year A lot of players and professional basketball is being released now and because the competition is such that they don't make the team and it's really sad to see young people who've been making one hundred twenty five hundred thirty thousand dollars a year all of a sudden unemployed and not really know what to do with themselves and more than that not to have money right So I think that the J.R. Foundation has the responsibility not only to help create images but also to work with the image makers in many ways The Muhammad Alis and the rod crews and the OJ Simpson's are the image makers and I think it's important for us to reach them as well This idea of stay in school and learn what you can learn too few athletes who really seriously mean that when they say it because one of the ways in which you know they meet it is that they follow it in terms of their own careers and for example in the NBA I think of all the players they are all the black players only about 20 percent of them have a college degree which is really ludicrous given the fact that they had scholarships given the fact that most them had the money to go back to school and given the fact that the average career is going to be five years and when they come out they're going to have to teach or work in hospitals or work as salesmen or managers or what have you And if they don't have an education they're not going to get those positions very much so Well tell us about your fundraising Any foundation is dependent upon funding I know that the all star game was dedicated in the memory of Jackie Robinson the also major league All-Star baseball game this year right here in New York was dedicated Indiana It wasn't you

Speaker 18 00:25:16.070
Yeah Wasn't he They played They kicked off the they kicked off the funding of the foundation which incidentally was started in 1973 and it was started primarily to protect Jack's name from people who wanted to use it to to use it in such a way that it would be detrimental to his memory And this All-Star Game was played in this year the summer in commemoration of his 30th year and the baseball the 30th anniversary of an injury to baseball right And they played five other games around the country for him the Dodgers being 1 and Atlanta Braves and the Montreal Expos and a surprising they they all played the games for him but they didn't come up with much money except the Dodgers who I think gave 5000 to the foundation and the Montreal Expos who did the same The rest up and just on it is memory well that wasn't really what we were looking for But be that as it may At least they recognized him as an individual Now we're that our next step in the foundation is to raise funds and people in and on all on all the scoreboards They said that donations could be sent to the Jackie Robinson Foundation and his box 42 J His number incidentally was 42 and his 42 J Brooklyn New York 1 1 2 0 2 and I'll repeat that a little later We're going into a dinner with ACLU who are cosponsoring a dinner for Jack on December the 14th

Speaker 16 00:26:55.100
Now for the audience the ACLU is an American Civil Liberties Union and it gets very important because in a sense Jackie's breakthrough was a victory for civil liberties

Speaker 18 00:27:05.180
So they're cosponsoring a dinner for him on December the 14 at the Pier Hotel people have been sending in contributions to the box and we will continue other fundraising programs after the first of the year Our goal for the first four 1977 is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

Speaker 22 00:27:26.540
We are confident that we will make it now I'm confident you are to actually that's a very modest goal I know that a lot I was trying to do well You have to set at modest It will become an attainable One of the things that people always want to know who are the operational people who actually run the foundation

Speaker 18 00:27:42.710
Well as President the foundation is my sister and Jackie's wife Rachel Robinson MARTIN Adelman is the attorney and we are now in the process of as soon as we get the funds together to have an executive director who will Ruddick permanently wait until you get funds You have to work within the organization or the people that you have

Speaker 16 00:28:04.800
I that I think with the you and Rachel and David and Martin and some of the other folks that you've mentioned that the foundation is really in good hands because each one of you in your own particular fields have reached some level of eminence and know the management process The real problem among black people in particular is funding activities other than churches and their social clubs I think that black people do an excellent job of funding their churches and funding their social clubs At one time we did a pretty good job of funding the NAACP when in the devil ACP struggles were those legal struggles to eliminate the overt aspects of segregation of discrimination But now that we can ride on the trains and sit in the hotels and go to the movies where we want to it seems that even in ECP is having difficulty attracting the type of support from the black community that it should so should attract What is your opinion about the reason why more black organizations not supported better by the black community

Speaker 21 00:29:13.590
Well I think most of them seem to feel that their integration is here for those that have money of course as you say they can travel on the trains airplanes and restaurants hotels but what they seem to forget that that's just an opportunity to spend your money not the opportunity to advance as a group And until we I serve as chairman for the National Business Week and until we recognize that we have to own something in this country or we can make some money then we're still going to be the guys who are always asking for something And until you fund these sort of foundations then we're gonna be in trouble And the NAACP certainly needs help too

Speaker 14 00:29:53.260
Welfare check out yes on the night so the reason has been Charles T Chuck Williams vice president of Chantilly affiliate brands Corp. and member the board and one of the founders of the Jackie Robinson Foundation Those who are interested in making contributions are finding out about the Jackie Robinson Foundation should contact the Jackie Robinson Foundation box 42 J Brooklyn New York 1 1 2 0 2 I think it's very important for those of us to support this foundation in honor of this great man This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for soul of reason This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with NBC
