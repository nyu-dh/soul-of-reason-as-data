What is the Congressional Black Caucus Who are the outstanding personalities who are supporting their annual fundraising dinner in Washington D.C. on September 20 9th here Harvey Russell vice president of PepsiCo and one of the co-chairman of the dinner discuss these topics on tonight's soul of reason This is Soul of reason

Speaker 2 00:00:43.140
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University

Speaker 1 00:01:08.140
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Harvey C. Russell who is vice president of PepsiCo and is one of the co-chairman for the Congressional Black Caucus dinner to be held this coming September 29 our first Harvey welcome to sole reason tonight Thank you Roscoe Could you explain the exact purpose of this dinner Probably your first order Explain to our audience what the Congressional Black Caucus is and then the purpose of the dinner and what your role is in this particular dinner While the Congressional Black Caucus is a loosely knit organization of the 16 black congressmen and congresswomen

Speaker 3 00:01:49.360
In the House of Representatives It was organized some two or three years ago When the number was only nine Incidentally most of us can remember when there was only one or two black congressmen Wilson and Adam Powell That's right And of course at one time there were none Between nineteen hundred and one there were several quite a few black congressmen after the Civil War during Reconstruction But the last one left Congress in nineteen hundred and one And then it was up in the 30s before the next one was elected That was Oscar De Priest from St. I know him from Illinois Yeah He was followed by Congressman Mitchell And then of course Adam Powell was the single one until Dawson was elected but for the longest time there were only two black congressmen Well after the Voting Rights Act and some reapportionment during the 1960s

Speaker 4 00:02:57.810
And last year's election we now have 16 black congressmen and one of those is Representative Fauntleroy who is in a sense sort of a paradox in our society The non-voting representative from the District of Columbia Yes Which is something we certainly ought to get corrected pretty soon

Speaker 3 00:03:15.730
That's right The black congressmen have gotten together to really discuss the problems that affect all minorities and they feel that there is much that they can do in terms of trying to use the legislative process to improve some of the situations and conditions that do affect the disadvantaged It is a nonpartisan group However all of the congressmen just so happened to be Democrats at this point

Speaker 4 00:03:47.680
Yes there is As aside it is nonpartisan because certainly if they were Republican Representative they'd be in the caucus Yes but it is interesting that at this stage in our political development as black people that all of our representatives are black and one senator who is not a member of the caucus because he is in the Senate Ed Brooke is a Republican Yes

Speaker 5 00:04:12.480
And it's sort of a paradox in a sense while it's really a paradox to when we uh I'm somewhat of a Negro History buff when we realize that it was only a by the way

Speaker 6 00:04:23.990
Harvey you tell it how old you are when you say Negro History Well when I started being above it was Negro his badge right Right

Speaker 3 00:04:33.730
But the the party of Lincoln the Republican Party was the party as far as blacks were concerned On Up until the second Roosevelt administration And because Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt was one of the first presidents in modern times to begin to pay some attention to the needs and desires of the black community Blacks then overwhelmingly became Democrats And I gather they have seen no reason to change this In the meantime so the great majority of blacks still are Democrats This accounts for all their congressmen being the Democratic Party However it is nonpartisan and they would welcome any black Republican congressmen to the caucus The purpose of the DNA is to raise funds for a research staff which the black caucus maintains they have an office that deals in the problems of minorities the problems of the disadvantaged the problems of the Urban centers the poor and they hope that through this research and through the information gathering that they can then use this material this information to more effectively use the legislative process and the passage of laws to help ameliorate some of these conditions

Speaker 7 00:06:00.150
One of the things that is so important in the legislative process is this background research and even though the library Congress provides a research service to representatives sometimes the service grinds along pretty slowly And if a representative or a senator has access to a research staff he can mobilize the type of information that enables him to formulate legislation but ultimately the results of this research should culminate in some form of legislation and hopefully legislation that will improve conditions for black people in group proof conditions for poor improve conditions for minorities of a variety of spectrum and in a sense the black caucus is the largest minority group in the in the House represented in the Congress really

Speaker 5 00:06:49.980
In fact the the information the research that they can can have done also will help them in interpreting legislation that's being proposed by other congressmen In other words this is not just so they can propose legislation It's so that they can analyze evaluate the whole scope of bills that are presented to Congress in terms of what particular facet of a specific bill or proposal can Help to change some of the conditions that are really

Speaker 8 00:07:28.530
Germane to all of that

Speaker 7 00:07:30.210
All of the black congressmen and also to determine whether or not to oppose certain legislation Yes for example a revenue sharing bill

Speaker 9 00:07:38.430
The final answer still is and I would on that although some of that preliminary research suggests that the inner cities in particular where they have a large number of blacks and other minorities are apt to lose on the revenue sharing Then the question is what kind of amendments do you put into this type of legislation or what type what facts can they present to the the Congress as a whole to

Speaker 5 00:08:05.490
Enlighten them as to what some of the hidden features are of some of the legislation There's still a big question as to so then I'm also a member of New York State Board of Social Welfare And there's a big question as far as how revenue sharing will be handled The way it's laid out It does contain everything with the exception of Enforcement or supervision I would say in a state like New York it might work out just as well but in a state where There is not the real consciousness of the problems or the poor I feel that there might be too much leverage given to the local mayors or governors or Local communities in terms as to how these funds are used So there is no Real responsibility to follow certain guidelines and there is no real follow up or no There's nothing to force a community to use the funds in the interests of the most disadvantaged

Speaker 7 00:09:15.570
Isn't that another role that the caucus plays however because I know in the past couple of years they have held hearings throughout the country and their role as congressmen to help bring to light things that you describe here for example inequitable use of moneys that are provided for inner city purposes Well like a congressional hearing which has the purpose of again collecting information for possible legislative action is another role that the Black Caucus has played Yes Now let's turn to the dinner itself Now you are vice president of community relations at PepsiCo and a national black figure and you are one of three co-chairman of this dinner which traditionally over the past three years has been one of the high points in both the social and political life of the black community throughout the country So could you tell us a little about the co-chairman the committee and actually what's going to happen at the dinner

Speaker 4 00:10:18.250
Yes well I'm one of three chairmen are we say chairpersons because how about Nancy Wilson and we couldn't say Chairman and chair ladies

Speaker 8 00:10:28.500
So we call ourselves chairpersons

Speaker 6 00:10:31.320
Oh I have heard in old days they used to say Madam Chairman I must say that Madam Chairperson Yes Nancy Wilson I'm sure all of you know Nancy Wilson is the Uh renowned entertainer and songstress and is also a person who has been very much involved in organizations and causes which

Speaker 8 00:10:57.540
Are out to improve the lot of the primarily black community And the third uh chairman is Leonard Woodcock who is the president of UAW Uh I'm sure you've heard his name quite a bit recently because he's involved in the uh UAW negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation at this particular point Now behind this the these three chairpersons you mobilized a committee of what two or three hundred people we have a committee of about 300 persons who have agreed to be on the DNA committee and they represent Oh chief executive officers of many of our largest corporations Uh they represent labor I represent the entertainment world and they represent uh every major black organization in the country The NAACP the Urban League the uh snake uh plus the the workers organizations the postal alliance uh So we have a very broad cross-section of the American public And there was only one party of the black medical association Yes the black medical association the uh uh right elected officials black elected officials in fact we expect to have quite a few of them after dinner because they are having a seminar on the day before in Washington the black elected officials So we feel that uh just to really give this support to the Black Caucus in this this uh endeavor and the fact that support is coming from uh I could name names but if I name a few But the largest uh some of the largest corporations in the country and many of them are buying tables to the dinner

Speaker 7 00:13:05.940
That's interesting Why would other than general social interest the large corporations really take such an active interest in the Black Caucus Well I know that some of them have some of the very very largest of our national corporations have both people on the dinner committee and also have already secured tables for it What is the enlightened self-interest that the major corporations are pursuing in that direction Well I think it's an enlightened self-interest in terms of uh uh the problems of the poor or the problems of the labor Uh

Speaker 5 00:13:42.990
The problems of minorities all right Also the problems of their employees there are the problems the social problems of the whole country And any Any effort to help to solve some of those problems also will affect the the health and growth of their individual businesses

Speaker 4 00:14:03.690
I know that a couple of the corporations in buying the tables specified that they were going to have some of their minority workers use those tickets Yes So that that in a sense is an educated process for blacks who might be in those companies Both join the companies interested in improvement of conditions for black people but also helping black people to become involved in improving their own status Yeah And there's one thing I would like to point out I've had many questions from uh uh

Speaker 5 00:14:33.720
Uh corporations or corporate representatives as to whether this would be a political contribution And I would like to assure you that none of this money will be used to support any political candidate not even members of the Black Caucus Uh none of this will be classified as a political committee that's a very good point

Speaker 4 00:14:54.570
In other words the money is going for the very basic purpose you said yesterday for research into various problems that face urban communities Yes And the country as a whole and minority people What about the black support Uh we've talked about the major corporations and we know that at least the top 1000 corporations are white from what we found in Fortune magazine and somebody said of the top 100 black corporations uh the number one corporation which I think was Motown and publishing would not s Johnson Johnson cosmetic cosmetic company and Johnson Publishing Motown But the point is that basically all of these are all of these are supporting it Yes Uh

Speaker 10 00:15:39.690
Now with the with the heavy emphasis as it should be on corporate support the black man in the street Although well the white man in the street may say well gee am I welcome

Speaker 6 00:15:52.540
Should I put the majority of the stuff I got into this

Speaker 8 00:15:54.930
Numerically the majority of the support is coming from the black man on the street who's buying one ticket or two tickets And I would say that at least 60 percent of the support of the DNA will be from the interested and concerned blacks who do not necessarily have that much money So they are not doing it as a contribution but they are doing it because they are really interested in the progress and the concern of the Black Caucus and in view of the fact that the price of the DNA is the classical political hundred dollars a head

Speaker 4 00:16:32.790
This does mean a considerable sacrifice for many that Jessica is attending In addition their transportation down to Washington now I had heard that some of the groups in New York were arranging special trips

Speaker 8 00:16:45.840
Yes there is a group in New York and I don't have the name Uh But uh black travel agency that is arranging for a 65 dollar weekend In other words this includes transportation down and hotel accommodation I'm not sure the meals are included but your transportation down and back and your hotel accommodations for 65 dollar

Speaker 10 00:17:07.740
So this is a package deal which I hope many people will take positively if anyone in the audience is interested they could contact the Congressional Black Caucus then a committee office in New York Yes 5 8 6 7 4 2 4 And get information on that Would you repeat that number so they can write it down That's very good training 5 8 6 7 4 2 4 for the Congressional Black Caucus dinner committee office in New York That's for people who want to attend And I believe also a number of people are giving contributions Some of the people who cannot attend either because of financial or business or personal commitments are sending contributions And this also should help the cause Now about the dinner itself I believe you are honoring Mayor Thomas Bradley from Los Angeles who is the black elected official to be the not the first mayor of a large city but it's called Stokes was the first But at present the mayor of the largest city who happens to be black and then Senator Ed Brooke the man from across the aisle from the other house of Congress the Senate is giving the major address right now What about you entertainment does that's all Well how big a factor We had a dinner of this type We have had a great response to our our Appeal to the entertainment world in terms of Giving their services to the Black Caucus and we

Speaker 8 00:18:43.860
For the great majority of you are one of our stars is Isaac Hayes And he'll have something like a 40 piece band backing him up So Isaac Hayes will be one of the entertainers the Del

Speaker 6 00:18:57.510
He'll have his gold chains to him Yes Yes he will Yes

Speaker 8 00:19:00.390
The Dells who have several top records right now And

Speaker 4 00:19:08.640
Nikki Giovanni Thank you Nikki Giovanni has regrets that she's gonna be in Africa at the time so she won't be if she really gets around able to be there Yeah I know but more is gonna be Mel and Melba Moore Yes Melba Moore will miss the excitement herself Yes

Speaker 8 00:19:22.590
But we will have many stars in the entertainment world who are attending the dinner including Aretha Franklin

Speaker 9 00:19:30.690
That's it Bye I know a giant ash was going to be there I don't know whether he's going to be in England again but the point did you developing is that there is a tremendous response Yes from the entertainment community as well as from the business community And of course when you have a show like Melba Moore and Isaac Hayes and the dells you have a show that's going to really put people on edge for what Ed Brooke has to say now what is going to be his main thrust

Speaker 10 00:19:58.140
Obviously you haven't read his speech yet I haven't read what is really the idea behind that because I think there is some real planning behind having Brooke as the major speaker

Speaker 5 00:20:07.800
Well we uh Senator Brooke has agreed to be the principal speaker for several reasons

Speaker 8 00:20:15.360
First of all he is black He is not a member of the Black Caucus because he is a senator and he is Republican And the idea of developing a total nonpartisan approach to the problems of the minorities is what he is really attempting to get across The Black Caucus ask him if he would appear and he was very pleased to do so Also Mayor Tom Bradley is being honored because not only is he the mayor of the fourth largest city in the United States but he has been elected on a nonracial basis because less than 15 percent of the voters in Los Angeles were black And we feel that this is a tremendous accomplishment And this also we feel exemplifies the upcoming thrust of the caucus to be non-partisan

Speaker 9 00:21:20.200
And on racial are abroad in terms of the problems of the total community and the work in larger coalitions because I had heard and had read the caucus generally tends to work with a another hundred representatives in Congress who tend to represent positive causes What you might call liberal causes causes for social justice And if you put this together this becomes upwards of 20 25 percent of the Congress and this can become a very significant power block in terms of social legislation in particular And I think it is important to highlight the non-partisan nature and the Coalition nature which then raises the question which is kind of interesting and that is to what extent white legislators who have similar sentiments as some of the Black Caucus supporting this or any of the prominent white members of Congress

Speaker 8 00:22:21.850
Yes there are there are quite a few attending and quite a few supporting it I don't want to name it because the list isn't complete as yet

Speaker 6 00:22:29.170
And when you name one you really are getting having other broad support from the other congressmen

Speaker 10 00:22:37.150
All right Now as we look to the future of black politics I think the theme of the caucus dinner in terms of the program is the and the strong keep coming from Sterling Brown's great poem which deals with the way in which black people have always worked to overcome those handicaps and even though they were set back they come back even stronger now particularly in 1973 when the number of elected officials throughout the country as literally quadrupled from I think the number is now at twenty seven hundred Major elected officials throughout the country So I think that has literally quadrupled from the time when they were like four or five hundred Now is this dinner saying and there's this emphasis on the caucus saying that black people need to be and are becoming more involved in the political process as a way of dealing with the various problems and concerns that they have

Speaker 5 00:23:45.940
I would say that this is the best indication of this the fact that through the civil rights groups of the 60s we were able to get a voting rights law We were able to get changes so that blacks could once again register and vote And as a result we have now become I will say a major part but certainly a sizable part of the whole elected scene matter right

Speaker 10 00:24:15.180
We've become the swing vote in a number of places in a number of places Now as the caucus begins to become more effective will there be a spin off to elected officials in the big cities in the rural counties and so on the black elected official do you think there'll be a spinoff from the success of the Black Caucus I think there could well be But

Speaker 8 00:24:41.320
Let me say you know I'm not really a congressman I'm not I'm not black

Speaker 10 00:24:45.130
I was the nice question I was going to ask is How do you Harvey Russell vice president of PepsiCo get involved in promoting the Black Caucus even though you are in fact a will say non political figure You perform a public service being on the Social Welfare Board in New York State But as a non political figure what was your commitment to this

Speaker 8 00:25:04.960
Well this is a personal commitment on my part I am not looking for a political appointment

Speaker 6 00:25:11.950
Well I would But I think that the potential that the Black Caucus has for

Speaker 8 00:25:23.050
Following up on some of the earlier programs of the 60s and doing it in a positive way through the legislative process I think they have one of the greatest potentials of any organization certainly in this country as far as ameliorating some of the the minorities and I said having been a black history buff I have followed very very carefully the progress of black elected officials and I just feel that this is an area where I'm pleased to represent the corporate structure Which I feel somewhat fortunate in being a member of but having been for so long

Speaker 11 00:26:04.160
And of course you're saying something else behind this To me I hear you saying you really expect the caucus to deliver by not necessarily these particular people in the caucus but the idea of black elected officials who have not only a responsibility to themselves to get elected over and over again but a responsibility to work collectively with others of like mind to change the conditions in the country for black people and for poor people and for other oppressed people And what you're saying is your commitment is to say to them you expect them to keep down the ball and to work even harder to be more successful

Speaker 5 00:26:50.360
That's exactly right And I think that I and anyone else who is out in this general community deserves that they deserve our support And I think if they get our support and I'm not just talking about blacks I'm talking about the total aware community

Speaker 11 00:27:09.170
If they get our support but I think that we're right and expecting them to produce in other words you are saying that the whole idea behind this Congressional Black Caucus dinner on September 29 is to let those of us who really believe in the electoral process and the process of dealing with our problems through laws and through the Congress and through our legislative bodies is to get out there and show that we really mean stand behind this

Speaker 9 00:27:39.950
That's right All right well Harvey I really want to thank you for being our guest on tonight sole reason and talking about this whole idea of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus dinner on September the twenty ninth

Speaker 10 00:27:53.480
And as we suggested if people were interested would call 5 8 6 7 4 2 4 They might get some more information about it Thanks again to Harvey Russell of PepsiCo for being our guest on tonight solar reason
