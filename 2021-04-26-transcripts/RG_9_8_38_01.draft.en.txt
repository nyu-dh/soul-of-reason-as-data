Speaker 1 00:00:01.270
The New York Drama Critics and the theater going public are all talking about the exciting new play The taking of Miss Janie now playing at the Mitzi Newhouse theater in Lincoln Center here. Playwright Ed Berlin's author of Miss Janie discusses play on tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason. A program that will examine the roots of the black bonds.

Speaker 2 00:00:45.750
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:06.570
Taking you Miss Janie is now at the Mitzi Newhouse theater in Lincoln Center and playwright Ed Rollins has created quite a controversy and quite a bit of excitement on this new play about the 1960s black and white relations. Our guest tonight on sole reason is Ed Berlin's author. Miss Janie glad to have you with us tonight. Glad to be here. Well this is really quite a play. Anyone who's seen it will thrill to the reminiscences of the 60s and also the projection of what some people might call stereotypes of such people as the black militant the white liberal the Jewish intellectual etc. And yet Berlin wrote it and he put it together and he's tried to say something. So what really are you trying to say in this particular drama. Oh.

Speaker 4 00:01:57.140
I'm only trying to tell the story of those particular people that I capture in that situation. And of course they represent other people and an audience can find some relatedness in the characters. So you know it's just a total story.

Speaker 3 00:02:20.120
Of course Miss Janie is a naive white woman who's interacting with blacks out of experience City College in New York and eventually as it says gets taken after many years of interaction in the civil rights the days of the struggle.

Speaker 5 00:02:40.670
And in these days of the struggle as you project in the play it is always a question of what is the relationship between blacks and whites why whites in the struggle and what blacks expect to get out of it. And one of the criticisms that I've read from some of the critics is that you don't tell us how to get out of it.

Speaker 6 00:02:59.420
What about that criticism.

Speaker 4 00:03:00.920
No well I'm a I'm a playwright not a prophet. You know I don't have any crystal balls in my back pocket. But some of the best minds of the civilization are trying to predict the future and sort of settle a goal for the society and my job is as a storyteller as. Leader of human history and experiences. I feel just to tell the story I don't have any pat answers.

Speaker 5 00:03:30.890
You know you have really told the story. It certainly is a case of some of the characters in the play as we mentioned earlier. In a sense symbolic or the real people as you've projected them of some of the things that we've gone through and the struggle I personally found a portrayal of a black nationalist a very interesting one.

Speaker 6 00:03:53.700
Let's describe how you evolved from being a Marxist in an integrated setting to a nationalist and sense the way he's projected and at play is nationalism is somewhat reflex which of course raises a dilemma not so much about nationalism but about everyone's behavior when one is going through social struggle. What do you feel as a playwright when you begin to develop something like this because you and I both have seen people like this which reason why you can write about and write about them so well. But as you develop a play and you're trying to develop this whole panoply of what happened in the 60s how did this come to you.

Speaker 3 00:04:32.950
That's something like reflecting on what you yourself went through what you observed or what you have heard others talk about doing that period. Well most writers know. They write a a bit of what they've experienced what they've seen the figures themselves are more or less allegorical figures and metaphoric figures to.

Speaker 7 00:04:56.540
Sort of designate points on a compass of thought.

Speaker 8 00:05:00.200
You know these were some of the prevailing thoughts or movements or representations of activity during that time. And you know to put all those types people ideas ideologies together in one setting and to have them interact or conflict which is the essence of drama I felt was very exciting.

Speaker 5 00:05:31.850
I know a number of your work uses this theater around type technique which I find very effective. Is this something that you characteristically set out to do or is it something you think more or less reinforces the message that you're trying to get across of the storytelling project.

Speaker 7 00:05:49.370
Well the structure of journey like some other plays a very fluid structure. It was originally done it consciously Playhouse which is a proscenium type of theater. And it worked there and now that it's at Lincoln Center at the new house theater it has a more of a thrust. But the production given Moses directed it very brilliantly. It can you know if it gives the right direction it can fit in to various situations. But my work lends itself to various interpretation.

Speaker 5 00:06:24.590
Yeah I've seen you work in several different settings and it does lend itself to that type of fluidity. What about this move to Lincoln Center from the industry to theater. The new Federal Theater really I think is the theater organization and put it together with the king's outfit. What about this move.

Speaker 6 00:06:43.880
Because I know many of the people in black theater say well look we got to keep black theater in the black community and we it's almost as though we had to keep it small not just really want to keep it small but that's type of theaters we have and how people can reach us and so on. Yet in the case of copy of plays duplex and this play case of river Niger from any sea we see black plays coming to Broadway as it were to the off Broadway to the larger off Broadway.

Speaker 9 00:07:14.300
Is there a particular reason for this is a particular move that's on why is this happening. What is the significance.

Speaker 7 00:07:23.300
Well in my case I'm just you know I see the move as fairly routine. I'm a we're working play right and that's where those are the people who are doing my work.

Speaker 4 00:07:39.410
We did a production workshop production at Henry Street which is a community theater and then to extend the life of the play to sort of what it would live and see wider audiences. It was picked up by Joe Papp and presented at Lincoln Center.

Speaker 8 00:08:00.680
I worked for years in Harlem and new Lafayette theater and before then on the West Coast and serious like black arts West and I've had plays done you know in the community theaters off Broadway around the country around the world even. And so at this point and in my writing life I tried to put my work in the best setting that will accommodate my work.

Speaker 4 00:08:36.020
I've written some 30 40 plays and some of them are better suited for you know smaller settings you know community theaters special situations and audiences and then some productions.

Speaker 8 00:08:50.450
They have a life of their own and they demand to get out and and me the writer I'm not always in control of it. You know that some of my work has found its way to Africa to Jamaica to Hungary to Czechoslovakia. Know which amazes me you know. But that's where the work goes.

Speaker 3 00:09:17.120
I frequently say as we talk with people in the theater and we do it frequently on a show that black theater really is the lifeblood of American theater they possibly even world theater and there's so many exciting things coming off of the panels and off of the lips and off the toes of black writers and performers that it has to be seen by the larger community. One of the criticisms of moving to Broadway in the large Off Broadway settings is that the plays become inaccessible to the black community. However I go to plays like yours or where's the River Niger and you see the majority the audience black which tends to suggest that maybe that isn't as valid criticism as it used to be. Do you think about that. What doesn't appear to be a valid criticism that for one thing many of the houses possibly feel the influence of the playwrights themselves and the producers do scale tickets at various rates they encourage group rates so that large segments of the black audience the black population can see these plays and become a part of the audience. The other benefit that I see is that when players do hit Broadway or the larger Off Broadway scene they get written about his show they get written about in white publications and generally by white reviewers but they also get written about by blacks and black publications and then you have the interaction between blacks and whites responding to the various reviews and the various commentaries on the plays. And I would think that that is a benefit from exposing the work of black playwrights to the larger audience. How do you feel about that because I know at one time in the movement it was sort of a thing that set of a black theater is ours talking to ourselves and we don't really even have to be concerned about getting the larger public into looking at and responding to our work.

Speaker 7 00:11:14.860
Well the larger public includes black people. You know that it's a sign of the times that in urban America that most inner cities are black. You know the downtown area belongs to those who control it take it you know at night you walk along Broadway and you know you see black faces you know you know they're there there's they're spending money they're looking good. They're excited. They want to express themselves. And and they choose those things that are expressive of them you know. So it's you know there's a saying that the Great White Way but black people you know have has changed that from just ethnocentric thing to. Two black participants toys you know.

Speaker 6 00:12:12.650
You know maybe Mr. great black way you know because I'm amused at the new record which I'm sure you've heard called Chocolate City which deals with the fact that so many of our cities are black and it was probably the largest Chocolate City is Washington D.C. itself which has about 75 or 80 percent population of black.

Speaker 3 00:12:31.000
And obviously as the city works just as effectively maybe in some ways maybe more effectively than it did before and the infusion of blacks into the inner cities certainly represents what we'd like to see in terms of a diaspora of people but more than that it shows that black people spend. Black people appreciate black people criticize just like everyone else. So therefore at least in my opinion it should be. And it turns out that it's it shows on the record a black theater going audience right.

Speaker 7 00:12:58.150
And it doesn't represent necessarily that it's a white rip off by white producers white entrepreneurs the producer of The Wiz is black. You know the co producer of my play they're take him as Janie's Woody King who is black. You know and like our black producers I mean or now you know exploding themselves getting together the capital many times from black sources and are doing the works of black writers for an audience and this audience is made up in the main black people whether it's on the audiences on 46 street or.

Speaker 9 00:13:43.990
Or you know West a hundred and twenty fifth street. Right. But some of the many many community theaters that are around now one of the things that I've observed and as we've had people on the show dealing with black theater is the.

Speaker 6 00:13:57.700
In a sense the change of topics in a change of emphasis in Black plays in a simplistic fashion oversimplifies fashion says Black plays. Oh ten years ago with they about dressed very heavily anger and lashing out at the White Man and lashing out at his conditions. And more recently black players become more ethnically introspective looking at each other as black people assessing what our roles and our responsibilities are.

Speaker 3 00:14:30.460
Is this something that you have observed as you look at let's say black theater for the past 10 years.

Speaker 7 00:14:37.550
Oh yes. The work has moved you know the literary movement has moved. We were for a time in a phase called the so-called protests phase of black writing where blacks were appealing their case appealing their situation and conditions to the whites or or downing the no the white man to.

Speaker 10 00:15:09.340
Gain more so a sense of self determination or self sufficiency to to themselves and their peers. But now the work has moved us over the last decade to a to a different stage in writing I call it the dialectic stage that is the stage of open discussion among various segments of thought in the community about the situation the place in history. What's going to happen you know mistakes of the past.

Speaker 7 00:15:48.380
What not this this this change from the protests to whites or a challenge by blacks or whites this change came about about ten years ago when certain black artists such as Amiri Baraka and this black arts he called it right school changed from addressing a mainly a white audience to almost a totally black audience and and infusing the work with a nationalistic and third world revolutionary context. And that's when I was writing plays and.

Speaker 11 00:16:34.530
Myself Marvin X Sonia Sanchez and many many other of the working black artists of the day came into the movement were in a movement and expanded on it and the work has changed from that being interested in telling the White Man how it is or how it should be or you know to being concerned about the interests of the Black Nation.

Speaker 12 00:17:03.330
You know the black people and the work man mainly falls into two schools of thought.

Speaker 10 00:17:10.920.0000000001164
They'll be like the dialectic of experience which dealt with the family plays or the plays on certain aspects of black community life urban life and the black life in general found in this country. And then you'll find the dialectic of change which which is a bit like the old protests phases but is it's it has different characteristics it doesn't make any apologies or it doesn't appeal to white people is concerned about reaching a black audience or saying what it says in these these messages or.

Speaker 12 00:17:56.610
These statements are important to blacks in themselves but there are there are various gradations within those two extremes. But the work is characteristic characteristically is a self exam is examining thing a thing you know as that's concerned itself among the people that ideas and that is setting the Black also setting against a beautiful lexical explication of what's happening.

Speaker 9 00:18:28.080
And it reminds us so much of what we try to do on his radio program. So the reason this year this month in fact this is our fourth year on the air completes our fourth year and we've been attempting to do exactly what you describe. We have people of various backgrounds various professions various interests talking literally with me and with the audience because in a sense I try to be the extension of the audience about what black people ought to be thinking about and how we can operate as black people and what are we. What are we going to do. And in my opinion plays drama in particular music does it too. But particularly our plays give us the opportunity to examine test feel out and well I agree with Ed Boland says that given play didn't make any difference because it helps me to examine where I'm coming from and I imagine the criticism that you get if your plays helped you to examine where you're coming from.

Speaker 7 00:19:23.940
Well the only critic well is about two critics that I respect first myself and then my audience.

Speaker 13 00:19:34.170
The other critics you know that's that's their job though their function or or whatever but criticism in America myth is there's so much negativity in it you know.

Speaker 11 00:19:48.600
So I never trusted critics.

Speaker 13 00:19:49.920
You know you know you know I write the work. I may show it to one or two people not for their opinions but because they appreciate the work and then I send it out into the world.

Speaker 9 00:20:02.640
How influential do you feel critics are in terms of audience response now do you think critics control audience response as much as they used to. Are they. Are they really more influential. Do you feel their influence. Yeah.

Speaker 10 00:20:14.640
That their influence influential I mean to say that they're not as to deny reality but go after the word gets out there word of mouth is you know a prime factor. But the work would never live we'll never survive unless it gets some some you know you know push some type of passive aggressive way but everybody is that is really really bad.

Speaker 14 00:20:41.790
You do have a hard time right.

Speaker 10 00:20:44.070
Right the critics the New York critics tried to kill that kill the Wiz.

Speaker 11 00:20:48.690
But the brother who was producing Ken Harper he stayed on his case and he succeeded until the black audience got in there the word of mouth started getting out and and the thing is to see this so so so if it wasn't for his tenacity that that that show that very important show because it's a landmark show would have not survived.

Speaker 10 00:21:14.870
The critics tried to kill was Swiss Re Sweetback but. But the people were in there and they didn't know they didn't listen. And so critics can be know damaging when you're in a marginal situation when when you need that audience to come in and feed the box office and pay your salaries in and and keep it alive. But if you can less than then critics become of less importance.

Speaker 14 00:21:44.270
And now that they go back and revisit a play that they have given a negative review and find some reason right something nice about it. I've seen that happen on more than one occasion. Oh sure. Sure. Well they're saying why is the audience proving me wrong.

Speaker 10 00:21:57.930
And let me go on the bandwagon too you know and because they generally you know the critical establishment like in New York. No well work in a theater is is with almost without exception totally white. Totally white. I know that in the major publications hire black critics really employ black critics the New York Times has recently changed its editorship of the Arts and Leisure section and the prison editor is almost reactionary. You know he he doesn't put in black critics may. Maybe I'll be proven wrong. I hope I'm proven wrong. So it's to survive in the very near near near future. He doesn't display blacks black productions and you know give good black productions the prominence they deserve. I mean that if you examine the past several months issues it was almost as if there was no Wiz.

Speaker 11 00:23:11.030
You know there was a couple token articles about the N and then he see or or maybe this one or that one but there was but there there's such a explosion of black theater like you say that that the black theater is like killing the dominant notes out there. I mean I mean black theater is changing will change all American theater just as black music has and so. So you have this very limited reactionary type of mentality at work through the publications and editorial policies through those publications writers. So blacks are dismissed you know. No the major thing going on today like the like important publication like The Village Voice It's not part of the radical chic rhetoric or the radical chic stance. So they dismiss it or they'll you know you know they'll try to down. But even so the work is surviving and going and getting getting stronger because it's getting out to the people and the people are coming and supporting it.

Speaker 9 00:24:23.690
I think for example that was is a very good one. Basically we're sort of turned around when they made a fantastic television commercial emphasizing the song he's on down the road and programs including ours began to have some of the performers on the air talking about the show singing some of the songs and then all of a sudden this overrode what the critics had written about the show. And that shows in a sense part of the power of the. Of the electronic media and also the power of aggressive people I can hop on to get out there and push things. But let me as we come to try to close the program introduce another idea. This is an idea which relates to your idea about the dialectic and that is to what extent is theater an effective commentator on the political scene and also to what extent does it possibly influence political thought.

Speaker 11 00:25:19.850
Well if the writer is as you know knowledgeable he can he can bring his observations his thoughts and present them on stage. The stage is commingling a marriage.

Speaker 12 00:25:36.950
Of all the arts and the verbal arts and the art of ideas and story presentation is one of those arts along with movement and illusion and and whatnot. So in certain times of history you have had had the theater very adept at summarizing or.

Speaker 15 00:26:00.980
Probably you know you know putting forth provocative ideas in the political or the social realm. So as always is traceable back to the writer you know. No. And fortunately in this time that we have. On a growing category of Young aware black writers who who are writing a book about this very important subject the black man in America and in the world such as Richard Wesley and many you know many of our South African brothers like those who wrote Sizwe we is dead.

Speaker 16 00:26:39.040
Well I'll say good.

Speaker 11 00:26:41.140
And he's a white South African.

Speaker 15 00:26:43.010
But do those brothers contributed their ideas and images and everything to make it a very strong and important work that it will have lasting impact. So so it can be very important. It can be then burn important but it's due to the consciousness of the writer.

Speaker 16 00:27:03.910
And of course I think it's also to the consciousness of the society. I think black people collectively are ready to deal with these issues more effectively than they did before and that too in my speech is a tribute to black theater for the audience who's interested in getting information and getting tickets for the taking a Miss Janie at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. They should call area code 2 1 2 e and 2 7 6 1 2 4 information on the taking a Miss Janie e and 2 7 6 1 2. Our guest on tonight soul of reason has been at Berlin's well-known playwright political commentator social activists whose current play the taking a Miss Janie is now at the meeting new Arts Theater at Lincoln Center and it is a play which is really very exciting.

Speaker 9 00:27:55.780
And Ed I want to thank you for coming with us and sharing some of your views and some of your opinions about what's happening in black theater and in the world. Thank you very much.

Speaker 17 00:28:04.390
