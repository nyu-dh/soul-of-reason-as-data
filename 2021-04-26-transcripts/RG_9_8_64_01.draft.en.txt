Speaker 1 00:00:01.200
Promise Hall London citizen Peter Salem. Samuel Stephan. What are these men have in common. They are all black soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War in battles in New York City and its surroundings here. Carol banks Florence Jackson and Bob Williams discuss Ebony Patriots a book describing their exploits on tonight's soul of reason. This is Soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:45.860
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:10.730
With us tonight to discuss an exciting booklet entitled Ebony Patriots about the participation of blacks in battles of the American Revolution in the New York City area our Carol banks of the staff of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University Florence Jackson director for the Center for the Humanities and the arts at the New York City Board of Education and Robert Williams director of community affairs for the New York City bicentennial corporation. So Bob possibly since when you were with the bicentennial Corporation in its formative stages you helped to organize the subcommittee on black contributions of the historical committee of the corporation.

Speaker 4 00:01:49.100
Maybe you could tell us something about the origin of this publication Ebony Patriots a rascal in the initial stages of the corporation. We had a rather large historical committee meeting and at the time we sort of threw a challenge out to that subcommittee through that committee which was really a blue ribbon panel. And we said that we thought it would be a disservice to New York City and the citizens of New York if all we came up with another annotated bibliography of participation of blacks etc. in the American revolution we thought that we should do a quality job and we had quality people. So we we had a you stepped forward as long as Florence Jackson and by Walter Scott Thomas and others to form a sub committee on black contributions in the revolution and we focused in on the New York metropolitan area from the years I think 1776 to 1779. So that was pretty much the background. And we went forward and got a small grant from the National Endowment of the humanities.

Speaker 5 00:02:57.490
I believe it was a National Endowment through the National American Studies firefighting which is an organization that studies American history.

Speaker 6 00:03:04.490
And the interesting thing about it was that we were able to go to primary sources and the Congressional Record and check muster rolls etc. And I think one of the beauties of this particular publication is that it will offer a student the chance to be aware of the kinds of research techniques that it would take to put together a document of this nature and they might be appropriate to mention some of the members of that subcommittee on black contributions besides myself who participated on the committee where Jean Blackwell Hudson who is the chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture New York Public Library.

Speaker 5 00:03:42.530
Florence Jackson is with us tonight who is the director for the Center for the Humanities and the arts at the Board of Education Elsie Lewis who is a distinguished professor of American history at Hunter College. Ruth and Stuart was assistant chief of the Schomburg and Violet Scott Thomas who is administrator of the American Museum of Immigration. And Bob I think that your participation in catalyzing this activity is indicative of the reason why we need black scholars and black professionals in all aspects of our society. Even though you're no longer with the corporation because the corporation now winding down its operations it is certainly important to acknowledge your contributions in this area. Well I think since I work with you on it I will say thanks. It was a great job.

Speaker 3 00:04:28.860
How far away from your end as the representative of the official what they call in bureaucratic jargon LGA the local education agency in New York City Board of Education How do you conceive of the potential value of this particular project.

Speaker 7 00:04:44.060
Well Rascoff The value is tremendous. First of all I'm delighted with the publication to have a material that can get into the schools which has primary sources. Bob mentioned primary sources and I like to say that those are the real documents that were available back at the period of the revolutionary era. And our approach in teaching social studies has been one of using original documents of using primary sources to help youngsters deal with the actual information that was available at the time that they are presently studying. And this happens to be the revolutionary period. And by doing that youngsters can get firsthand some of the information that historians usually use and that which they usually get in their textbooks later on from the point of view of the historian. But by giving them the original documents students an opportunity to make up their own minds and get the information that they should have about different periods in history. So from that sense I think the material is extremely valuable. There is another aspect. For example it's written very clearly. It has descriptions of the battles and story form. It's a kind of.

Speaker 8 00:06:05.070
You are there a booklet which is an interest interesting sort of format and a style for young people because they can become involved in what has been written about. Also I think it's very valuable for our teachers to have this kind of information which is omitted from our textbooks much too often. And it doesn't make any difference what course they teach. But I think it would help teachers view youngsters in their classrooms many of whom are now black in a different light.

Speaker 3 00:06:42.100
It will give these youngsters a sense of identity a sense of history a sense of worth in the eyes of teachers and of course one of the things that I believe you're going to do in your capacity out of education and see to it that I believe each school district and get some copies of the booklet for you.

Speaker 7 00:07:01.870
Yes we're delighted to know that every school district in New York City will receive copies free not enough copies for every teacher. But I hope that maybe some funding would come through so that we can have enough copies available for every teacher. But yes the booklet will be available to every school district the superintendents will be receiving copies and the principals also will be receiving copies to be used in their schools.

Speaker 3 00:07:28.060
And this project is an example of a collaborative effort that is best we had Bob Winston the bicentennial corporation. We had to find Jackson and Jean Hudson and Ruth and Stuart and others working on the committee. And many of the suggestions in terms of making the book alive and have pictures and so on came out of the committee and beside the sponsorship of the American Studies faculty and the New York City bicentennial Corporation and the Institute for American affairs at New York University provided some financial support and also some staff support and a lot of writing because in this involves a tremendous amount of writing and the primary research was done by Leo Rivera who is a graduate student at Columbia who actually spent countless hours in the Library of Congress in the National Archives in historical museums all up and down the East Coast to coalesce information. I will list tonight as Carol Banks was a fellow at the Institute of Afro-American affairs who did much of the Creative Writing building up on some of the things that we have done in terms of our research through the committee. So Carl maybe you could tell us two things. I know everyone when I mentioned this project. How do you know that there were black soldiers there. What actual documentation do you have and maybe you could take one particular soldier and indicate what he did in the publication we identify some 20 soldiers black soldiers who fought in the revolutionary battles with probably as many many more than that because all over in total over 5000 blacks fought on the side of the Americans.

Speaker 9 00:09:03.280
And interestingly enough 10000 blacks or more fought on the side of the British.

Speaker 3 00:09:07.750
And that's because the Americans initially resisted the enlistment of blacks in defense or in fighting for freedom which really points up the true paradox of the so-called American Dream that we live. KARL So maybe you could pick up on that. How do you know there were black soldiers there and tell us a little about one of those soldiers.

Speaker 10 00:09:26.290
Well first Florence mentioned that it was important to introduce into the elementary and secondary schools and some primary materials so that the students could examine that and make their decision based on the original research. And in compiling this study of course we ran into some of the same common problems of historical research dealing with primary sources and that is that.

Speaker 11 00:09:53.920
The difficulty in really identifying them and validating sure particularly as concerns that the Revolutionary War as a revolutionary period. Many of the records were destroyed in fires after the war and the record keeping was fairly haphazard in the recruiting practices were difficult to trace. Recruits enlisted for different lengths of service and so on but recognizing that all those problems. We did manage to identify at least these these 20 knowing that there are. Many many more. Whose names may have escaped us thus far and will no doubt with further research be able to turn up. The names and descriptions of their exploits have many more. Are the identification of these black soldiers began with the examination of the roles of the units that took part in the battles in and around New York City for names that were commonly used by blacks in the colonial period. What were some of these names. Latin names said Kato Caesar Pompey and Plato. Often taken by banks during the period or given to slaves by their masters in the 18th century. Also slaves and free black men sometimes are ofttimes took the name free men.

Speaker 5 00:11:19.210
So when you got these key words and you looked at the mustard Rolls which were really musty we went down into the various historical societies for example in the book one of the primary sources it says list of American non-commissioned officers and soldiers taken prisoner kill at the Battle of Long Island from Long Island Historical Society military document number sixty one and actually Leo Rivera had a go down and pull these out and actually copy these names.

Speaker 9 00:11:46.990
These code words to identify whether they were black. Then they went to be the pension application.

Speaker 11 00:11:53.930
Right. Yeah. The applications filed with the War Department by veterans requesting their pension benefits and ofttimes these applications identified the applicant by race sometimes. Fortunately they gave accounts of the applicant service during the war.

Speaker 12 00:12:10.360
Well let's take one of those accounts I think there's a very interesting account here of a soldier by the name of Samuel Sutton was born a slave in New Jersey and he entered the Army as a substitute for his master and have many many many slaves dead or black people did. And apparently he landed somewhere on Long Island he got stuck and they had to find him. You tell us a little about that.

Speaker 11 00:12:31.900
Yeah well Samuel said Fine I look at it as them as an example of individual initiative.

Speaker 10 00:12:38.830
In that day in the evacuation from Long Island Samuel 7 along with many others were there since the the evacuation was done in such a haste.

Speaker 12 00:12:50.700
It was like an evacuation like the British leaving Dunkirk. And for those who don't remember the battle well. How real is the Battle of Brooklyn and they moved off of the Fulton Street pier and they got onto rafts or large rafts like vessels that were manned by a group from Marblehead Massachusetts known as Glover's ranges. And one hundred and fifty of those were black soldiers black soldiers participated actively in the battle line which by the way it was not a victory for the colonialists. They were defeated in the Senate.

Speaker 5 00:13:23.500
Well possibly Bob you might summarize the the contributions of this project to the overall bicentennial process.

Speaker 6 00:13:34.680
Well resolute. Actually we wanted to. Have every race take pride in its participation in the battle for independence. And our our approach is that just like Fourth of July in all New York we you know we emphasize the whole ethnic. Input into the US into the revolution and we then feel as though this particular contribution is significant to the pride of black people.

Speaker 12 00:14:04.320
So we're talking this evening with Carol banks of the Institute for American affairs Florence Jackson of New York City Board of Education and Bob Williams of The New York City bicentennial Corporation about the Ebony patriots. And to go back to Samuel Sullivan Carol maybe you could tell us why this particular man was so exceptional. I'm sure some of the audience who live in Queens might say Southern Boulevard named after saying that often the answer is No. That phone was a name and of his owner and the Sullivan family was a very important family in New York at that time. So could you tell us about why Samuel Sutton is important in terms of studying black history.

Speaker 10 00:14:44.920
Sure. In addition to the fact that he he is a good illustration of the kind of performance that black soldiers were able to render before during the Revolutionary War and that he participated not only on a. Fetch and carry level but that he actually did participate in the battle himself as it as a fighting soldier.

Speaker 11 00:15:05.680
But more important to me is Sam your sponsor serves as an illustration of the problems that black soldiers experienced after the war in that it was mentioned that Sam said Finn had joined the Army as a substitute for his master and not an uncommon practice during the war and it had been promised his freedom at the end of his service. And apparently if he is you read the account of his service at the Battle of Long Island he served very well after the war he continued to serve with Colonel Seeley and in fighting the the Indian allies at British who was later wounded and taken to West Point to recover after he was discharged. However Sam's having returned to New Jersey to collect his man new mission.

Speaker 10 00:15:53.330
Papers from his master and what happened why is that and instead his master and sold him. Twenty years later he was able to purchase his own freedom. The point is that even though some of the agreements that were made during the during the war in the initial stages of the war the promise of freedom and in return in exchange for service were not some were fulfilled. SAM 7 hadn't to be one illustration of a case where the bargain wasn't upheld most of them weren't fulfilled in fact.

Speaker 12 00:16:29.130
And of course this indicates the legacy of racism that we're living right in 1976. And of course it's epitomized in the three fifths of a man provision of the Constitution where blacks were counted as three fifths of a person for purposes of electing the House of Representatives so that the situation where black people have been made promises on and they've been promised things and these promises have been reneged on goes all the way back to Samuel said fine and of course before Florence maybe you could react to this idea of the omission of black history from so many textbooks. Obviously Ebony Patriots is designed to help fill this gap. This is a very exciting story is very intricate story. And of course it represents only a minuscule segment of black participation in the Revolutionary War. Why do you think Black History has been omitted from textbooks and what is being done about it.

Speaker 7 00:17:27.740
Well first of all I think that most of the history that we do read have been written by people of other ethnic groups who have the attitude that blacks never contributed much to American society and American history as well. And as we do more and more research we find that blacks have contributed in all aspects of American life. There is one statement and the end of the Ebony Patriots which I think is significant and we should remember and that is that black men have fought and died in every war in this nation's 200 year history to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation a reality. This is a truism which in studying our original documents again we find that blacks have contributed in that area. But in looking at other original documents we find that blacks have contributed in terms of literature. They contributed in the arts. They've contributed in all of the cultural elements of American society. And that can be traced back to the earliest times. So all of this information has been left out of our history books traditionally we are making some movement in talking with publishers and including information in the texts that are used in the schools by actually demanding more representation of blacks and other ethnic groups as well so that our history is not distorted and is not filled with all kinds of omissions as we realize you can't get all information into one textbook but at the same time we do feel that there is pertinent information from all the ethnic groups in American society and this pertinent information should be included.

Speaker 9 00:19:16.540
Of course that's one reason for the existence of institutes like the Institute of Afro-American affairs and the recent surge for Black Studies and so on that came after Dr. King's death. Not that this hadn't been started as far back as 1915 with Carter G Woodson's founding of the merit association of the Study of Negro Life and History. But the point is well taken of course textbooks are written from the eye of the beholder and generally the eye of the beholder is a partisan white male which means there's a tremendous amount of sexism in the books. There's a tremendous amount of anti Catholicism anti-Semitism and certainly because racism has been a pervasive force in America it's all over there now Bob as we come toward the end of this bicentennial celebrations wind down period.

Speaker 5 00:20:01.910
You're going on to other things and no the other folks who worked on this project are going to do other things. And so there's just not one big bash one big party. One of the things some of the things that you feel that you've left in the bicentennial Corporation has left for posterity in terms of black participation in black contributions.

Speaker 6 00:20:22.250
Well certainly this publication ask No I think that it's it's going to be disseminated through the school system. It's also going to be disseminated to community organizations and individuals will be able to and service organizations such as all these people. This will be sort of perpetuated. I hope that this will sort of inspire rants from other funding sources to see that this type of research in this kind. This kind of publication and activity can be carried on past the bicentennial. I think this is pointing in the right direction. We did a heritage trail of black heritage trail out in Queens which identified some 10 or 12 first for blacks in Queens and they will use a system of trail trailblazers as they call them. Similar to the trailblazers that are being used for the heritage trail in lower Manhattan. I think that we did a number of innocent museums and other things which were able to establish the ethnic roots in communities by the use of artifacts and memorabilia etc. And I think that these kinds of things will be carried on in many instances these will go into permanent collections and be the start of outreach museum programs etc. and things that would enable the local community to relate better on a better PA level with the existing institutions and the museums and the the various historical societies etc in the area.

Speaker 13 00:21:55.280
I think that the bicentennial. By and large in the black and minority communities has been a matter of ways in raising the level of awareness of the people and a sense of identity of themselves. And as far as that earlier it gives you a sense of worth a sense of pride and a sense of identity towards the fact that you know you were not just here as a slave and when you really look at it the slave really built this country if you if you really want to take. Inventory on it and just as blacks were not allowed to fight in the Revolutionary War and the reason they were able to fight was because the Americans after the Lord was done more would have was made the proclamation that that Americans could fight and get their freedom if they fought for the British then Washington changed his his position and allowed Americans to fight under certain circumstances etc.. So I think that when we look at the names of the blacks and the fact that they took the name of a slave owner and fought for him or his son etc. you see how the the contributions that black blacks made and I think that when youngsters are exposed to this in through the Ebony patriarch and other things that have been produced during the bicentennial period here in New York City I think that a level of of self-worth has been accomplished through the bicentennial activities here.

Speaker 12 00:23:21.950
And I think you really should be proud of your efforts in this area. It's probably something you'll remember for a long period of time.

Speaker 6 00:23:28.330
Well I am rather proud of my my position when I came onto the corporation was that I felt you know many blacks felt they wouldn't participate in the bicentennial and I thought that that was not a mature approach. I thought we had done many things. And I thought that we should take this opportunity to highlight those things that we have done and with persons such as yourself and Florence and that blue ribbon panel I really take pride in being associated with that group and many others who have really stepped forward and said hey we we stand up to be counted and we're proud of what we did.

Speaker 12 00:24:01.550
And it's the time to challenge say the bicentennial represents an ideal time for black Americans to challenge challenge the system to challenge those dreams that have not been fulfilled the promises that have not come our way. And in a sense when you go back history the mark of history is unrelenting. That's in the record why it happened and possibly we might argue about. But certainly it's in the record now Carol as you wrote this it began to integrate some of these pieces of research. What was the basic feeling that you had. You were really in the sense as you dramatize this in your writing a party to an epic of history. You were there as it as I used to say in a television program. You were there.

Speaker 10 00:24:51.740
What was some of the feelings you had as a historian as a person studying history yourself and as a black person that was there you were there and feeling is what we wanted to get across to the to the elementary and secondary school children as well in order to to give them the sense that not only of the importance of the contribution the significance of the contribution but to make it and an interesting kind of a sense sort of lived through it themselves.

Speaker 12 00:25:27.820
Yes. But as you would find you wouldn't have a comment on that.

Speaker 14 00:25:31.910
Yes I like to get back to a beautiful map that's on page 5 of Ebony patriots. And when you talk about you were there approach their names that youngsters can recognize and find on the map. For example there is Kip's Bay on the East Side of Manhattan. There's Harlem Heights where a battle was fought. There's Brooklyn Heights where another battle was fought this to the youngsters who especially those in schools and those particular areas. This kind of information is brought to them makes it even more alive because they can say here is Brooklyn Heights and maybe with other visuals can see what Brooklyn Heights looks like back during a revolutionary period and compare it to today and they could do it a great deal of research in terms of who were the different people who lived in Brooklyn Heights who lives there today. What's happening with Brooklyn Heights. They can do the same thing for Harlem who was living there during the Revolutionary period. Where were any people living there and who were living there now. You see so that I think that there's a tremendous amount of information in this particular booklet which can be utilized in a variety of ways and give youngsters that feeling that they too can do some of the research that you did earlier to prepare this particular book booklet.

Speaker 12 00:26:50.730
Now Carol again as you were working through this you have the work of the primary researcher Vito Rivera. You had all the input from the various committee people you had to put this together with the help of Luis Baggett of our staff and in pulling this together you had to highlight certain things. So what were you really trying to highlight. We're trying to highlight the contribution of individual people to make them heroes are we trying to highlight just the process of involvement of blacks in the struggle. I think that the latter what.

Speaker 10 00:27:26.070
It's difficult to to isolate any one person in any stage of American history is that it is an outstanding and I think it's the overall effort on the part of black black men slave and free that we were trying to pass on to the to the students the fact that that black soldiers especially during the initial stages of the war had to take the initiative themselves. Black men had to take the initiative themselves over the opposition of the Continental Congress.

Speaker 12 00:27:58.190
And and just general public opinion in order to be able to participate in the battles at the beginning and of course this ending statement in the booklet which can be obtained by the way from the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University at 70 Washington Square South says that to this very day Ebony Patriots continue to serve with honor in the struggle for freedom justice and equality at home and abroad. I'd like to thank our guest on tonight soul of reason Bob Williams of The New York City bicentennial corporation Carol banks of instead of Afro-American affairs and Florence Jackson of New York City Board of Education.
