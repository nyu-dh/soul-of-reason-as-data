Black athletes have always excelled in sports-- in basketball, baseball, boxing, track and field, and football. Too frequently however the Black community is unaware of their exploits. Here, Eddie Younger of the Harlem Professionals Incorporated discuss what Black athletes are doing today to honor their old-timers on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:42.662
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:01:09.450
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Eddie Younger, who is with the New York City Department of Recreation, is a board member of the Harlem Professionals Incorporated, and is one of the legendary basketball greats of New York City. Glad to have you with us this evening.

Eddie Younger 00:01:23.051
It's good to be here Dr. Brown.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:01:24.540
I won't tell the audience, you know, when you were a legendary basketball great but people who watched LIU in the Garden and watched the Renaissance-- and you've been around-- they know about Eddie Younger because Eddie Younger is a tall man in spirit but a short man in stature. Probably had the fastest hands in the West. That's what we like to say.

Eddie Younger 00:01:40.496
Thank you, Dr. Brown. Thank you.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:01:42.691
All right now let's talk about something that's really very important to me and to you and to those of us who've been involved in sports in the nation, in New York City-- and that is honoring our old-timers. First maybe you could tell us something about the Harlem Professionals and then you can begin to just discuss some of the things that the Harlem Professionals and other groups are doing to honor Black old-timers in sports?

Eddie Younger 00:02:08.370
Well we have what you call-- under the umbrella of the Harlem Professionals-- we had the John Hunter Memorial Scholarship Camp Fund. And we're conceiving and constructing a cultural and social program focusing on the historic and current values of Blacks in America today. The purpose of our luncheon, which was held June twenty-first is twofold: to increase the awareness of Black history-- to reinforce, broaden, and carry the roots of ethnic identity deep into the meaning of everyday existence-- and to provide scholarships to send youngsters of the inner city to camp during the summer. Because half of these-- most of these kids do not know what green is and what not, so we have a chance to send them away to camp. And in the meantime honor some of our Black heroes of yesteryear, the ones that paved the way, the pioneers who never received any recognition. That these youngsters are-- Black youth do not know anything about. If they had an idea what these people had to go through, maybe they get a different idea what it's all about and get a chance to get more confidence in themselves, in accomplishing whatever deeds they may set out to accomplish.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:03:20.610
Of course you said something that was very beautiful when you talked about exploring the heritage of Blacks and understanding their roots. And of course--particularly through a program like "Soul of Reason"-- we're concerned about roots and the roots of Black people, as you know, or in music and art and politics and education and certainly in sport. And many of the forerunners of today's great athletes, like Jabbar and Hank Aaron and OJ Simpson and so on, are not known. And they represent our roots. And when a group like the John Hunter Memorial Fund, the Harlem Professionals, gets together to honor them, that itself is significant. But you're taking a kind of a living memorial-- namely raising money to send youngsters to camp-- which is part of the circle that your organization, and Bob Williams' organization Sports Foundation, and Harlem Professionals, and so on are trying to do in terms of bringing back to the community something that the community has done for us and then hoping to expand it to help other young people.

Eddie Younger 00:04:32.550
Yes, well you see like on our luncheon-- we started as Harlem Professional Hall of Fame in 1972. When Holcombe Rucker, the late great Holcombe Rucker, was inducted--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:04:43.701
Oh, the well-known Rucker tournament.

Eddie Younger 00:04:45.092
-- yes the well-known-- also we put in Mr. Bob Douglas the owner and founder of the famous Renaissance which started in 1922.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:04:55.080
I think for the audience who doesn't know Bob Douglas, Bob Douglas is a gentleman--he's about ninety-two years old I believe--

Eddie Younger 00:05:02.432
Ninety-three.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:03.021
--is still involved in the community, goes to Affairs, motivates young people, and literally, out of his hip pocket, carried the Harlem Renaissance team from greatness to be the first major Black team to win a national championship in any major athletic competition--

Eddie Younger 00:05:20.353
Nineteen thirty-nine.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:21.201
--which they did in 1939. And that's really part of the heritage. And for anybody who knows Mr. Douglas, you know the integrity that he still brings to the world of sport. I've talked to many people who were in the various pro leagues and they said that Bob Douglas's handshake was just like a contract.

Eddie Younger 00:05:41.051
Definitely, definitely--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:41.053
Word meant everything--

Eddie Younger 00:05:43.190
--meant everything.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:43.701
And this is the type of thing that fellows like yourself who played for the Renaissance at one time are trying to do. That's just one part of it. Basketball is one part of our heritage. There are other parts of our heritage which were also honored through your Hall of Fame.

Eddie Younger 00:05:58.250
Yes definitely-- like this last luncheon on June twenty-first, we honored Mr. Fritz Pollard. He's All-American at Brown University in 1919. As pioneer-- first Black All-American, I think, on camps, All-American-- great, great--he's eighty-three years old young. And it's just too bad you couldn't have made that luncheon, Dr. Brown just to see-- Mr. Pollard received all kinds of awards during his career and his life-- and to see him when he got up there on the mic, he broke down. He started crying. Then I looked around. My wife was crying. The great Pop Gates was crying. Everybody in the audience was crying. And Bob Douglas behind him-- ninety-three years young-- telling him "Cut it out, Fritzy. Cut it out, Fritzy!" Going back to 1916, which Mr. Pollard went back to 1916, composed himself and went on to tell how he kicked-- Black people, Black football players were not allowed to kick field goals in those days. And that Saturday he kicked three against Princeton. He kicked three against Harvard the following week. And he came back the following week against Yale and kicked three. So these people like Mr. Pollard and the rest of the people that we have inducted into the Hall of Fame, we're trying to bring out to the youth to show them that these were the pioneers. These are the guys that paved the way.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:07:27.521
Speaking of Fritz Pollard, I think it's really very important to know that Fritz Pollard well might be the person who started professional football. Because Fritz Pollard was the great football player-- he was the OJ Simpson and the Joe Namath all wrapped into one-- of the late 1910s, around 1918, 1919--

Eddie Younger 00:07:48.450
Well, he was the first Black-- I didn't mean to cut you off Dr. Brown-- He was the first Black to play in organized pro football in 1919 as player-coach to the Akron Pros. Won the--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:07:57.140
That's exactly right--

Eddie Younger 00:07:57.143
--world's professional football crown in 1920.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:08:00.650
That team-- followed by the Staleys headed by George Halas-- really was the beginning of pro football. And in a sense you can say, although it isn't just one man, but a Black man Fritz Pollard was really responsible to a large measure for the beginning of this great football craze. And Fritz Pollard is not a big man. He's a man who stands about five eight or thereabouts. He had a tremendous toe. He would punt, he would kick field goals, he would drop kick, he would do everything--

Eddie Younger 00:08:28.170
But he weighed 155 pounds--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:08:29.811
-he was just a will-o'-the-wisp. And people who were following football, particularly Ivy League football, came out in droves to see him. And that was the beginning of great American pro football. And everyone, white and Black alike, should know about a Fritz Pollard. And when you say that he wasn't allowed to kick field goals-- that means to score-- because he was Black, I'm sure that many in the audience both Black and white [unintelligible] "What are you saying, what do you mean he wasn't allowed to if he was the best?" But racism has run so deeply in American sport and American life that many times the best person who might have been Black was not allowed to do it. And that is the reason why we need to honor men like Fritz Pollard and men like George Gregory who broke the barriers at Columbia.

Eddie Younger 00:09:21.331
Yes George Gregory--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:09:22.031
And men like Jesse Owens whom everybody knows. But again even a person like Jesse Owens who was the world's fastest human, and some of his records probably still stand, needed to be pushed into the forefront.

Eddie Younger 00:09:34.870
Yes, well you take George Gregory, he was the first Black college-- or All-American-- at Columbia in 1929. First captain-- he was captain at Columbia. They won two Ivy League titles-- two in a row. But you ask someone, "Who's George Gregory?", and no one knows.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:09:54.050
And not only that, a man like George Gregory is not in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Even though somebody named Joe Schultz, right or whatever anonymous name might be is in the Hall of Fame which reflects the racism which is what Bill Russell was saying when he refused to attend his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Because right now there are literally only two Blacks, one is the legendary Bob Douglas as an owner, and the other is Bill Russell who in the Basketball Hall of Fame. And anybody who looks at any television set and sees that eighty percent of the players and ninety percent of the top scorers are Black has to say, "What is wrong with the Basketball Hall of Fame?" And I think our audience should know about that and someone might want to pick up their pencils and begin to protest that.

Eddie Younger 00:10:40.140
Well as far as the Bill Russell situation, he did not say why he refused to accept the nomination. But Mr. Lee Williams is Executive Director of the Naismith Hall of Fame in Springfield--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:10:52.620
Which is in Springfield Massachusetts--

Eddie Younger 00:10:53.810
Yes, yes. He put in the paper when Russell rejected. This is from The Daily News. But we do have Black players. We have Wee Willie Smith. We have Zack Clayton. We have Bill Yancey, Johnny Hope, Pappy Ricks, and Tarzan Cooper. Now this is what you call a leading lie, because there's only three teams in the Hall of Fame. The Buffalo Germans-- the Buffalo Germans have Marty Friedman. And the original Celtics of 1926-27-- but they have four in there as individuals: Dutch Dennett--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:11:23.460
Joe Landry--

Eddie Younger 00:11:24.000
--Nat Holman, Joe Lapchick, and Johnny Beckman. Now the Renaissance, 1932 is in there as a team, but there's not one individual from that 1932 team that won eighty-eight straight games in the Hall of Fame. Not as an individual, only as a group. But you see Mr. Williams, as I said before, is not telling the truth when he tries to say that they have members in the Hall of Fame. We have no individuals.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:11:52.870
Of course at least the ostensible reason for this is that they haven't been nominated and haven't been voted on. And I think that's one of the reasons why it's important for people like yourself, people like myself, people in the audience, who want these people in the Hall of Fame to go through that arduous process of nominating them getting those forms filled out and then getting votes. Now as Bill Russell said-- and one of his concerns was that Red Auerbach who was his coach said he had to work so hard to get Bill Russell in the Hall of Fame. And Bill Russell said, if you had to work so hard to get me in the Hall of Fame with all I've done for basketball something must be wrong with you. And of course the working hard means getting the coaches and the writers who vote for entrance in the Hall of Fame to overcome their racism and elect the best person. And that's a very strong charge. But I think the mere absence of Blacks, of no notable Blacks who've been players and coaches in the Basketball Hall of Fame certainly reflects this.

Eddie Younger 00:12:51.130
Well--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:12:51.681
And I think underlines the needs of groups like the Harlem Professionals to develop these Old Timers Hall of Fames to honor Black athletes so that as more Black athletes become identified the larger public will be more willing to deal with it.

Eddie Younger 00:13:06.260
Well the pitiful part of it is they had Tarzan Cooper. You take the great Tarzan Cooper whom Joe Lapchick was on a personal campaign before he passed away to try to get Tarzan Cooper inducted into the Hall of Fame as an individual. Tarzan Cooper was one of the most devastating players of his era and he definitely belonged in the Naismith Hall of Fame. And it's a disgrace that he is not one. Him, Fats Jenkins, Pappy Ricks, Pop Gates-- you name them.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:13:33.681
Well I understand that your organization-- the people you're working with-- are beginning this campaign to get Tarzan Cooper into the Hall of Fame of Basketball.

Eddie Younger 00:13:42.662
Definitely yes we did--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:13:44.371
Now, one thing that I think is interesting, and you mentioned it very well, that some of the white athletes who played against Black athletes during a time when sports were segregated have themselves opted for and attempted to promote the Blacks that they played against-- an example is Ted Williams. Ted Williams, a great legendary Boston Red Sox baseball player, when he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame made as his opening speech the fact that the Hall of Fame did itself a disgrace by not having people in it like Josh Gibson, who is a legendary Black-- probably even in the eyes of most whites-- the greatest player ever to play baseball including Babe Ruth, was not in the Hall of Fame. They tried to set up a little segregated corner of the Hall of Fame and fortunately some of the white sportswriters and white athletes as well as the Blacks objected to this. And now you do have an election-- it is a special election but nonetheless the Blacks go into the Hall of Fame just like anyone else. And to date, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige and Buck Leonard and Cool Papa Bell have entered the Baseball Hall of Fame as first-class citizens. And I think that points again to the importance of an organization like yours in identifying and honoring Black sports heroes. But to move past just some of those individuals, let's talk about what people like Eddie Younger, people like yourself, are doing through this program to help inform and enlighten the youth of Harlem, and I would say the youth of Harlems throughout the nation. Because actually that is the outcome of your activity. You honor, you give plaques [unintelligible] Hall of Fame but the outcome of the activity is money for the Hunter Camp fund and also a whole range of educational and uplift activities for Black youth. So could you tell us a little something more about the Camp Fund maybe how it came about and some of the things that you're actually doing with some of these youths?

Eddie Younger 00:15:52.720
Well the Camp Fund came about when the Harlem Professionals-- they have their pro tournament. They were having it up there at 155th Street there on Eighth Avenue-- the Holcombe Rucker playground. And when "Twenty Grand" John Hunter passed away, those four fellows got together and they wanted to give-- wanted to put ten dollars a piece, and wanted to donate forty dollars to the Harlem Professional to have a trophy in honor of John Hunter.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:16:19.921
Now could you tell the audience who John Hunter was?

Eddie Younger 00:16:22.951
John Hunter was affectionately known as "Twenty Grand". He was a fellow that loved kids. He traveled all around, watched the kids, try to give them advice to stay in school and leave drugs alone because he came from 132nd Street and Madison Avenue, was there all his life, and that's a haven for all the addicts. And he would try to get these kids off the drugs and to stay in school and make a better life for themselves. So therefore we felt that-- here's a guy that really should be honored. He wasn't a doctor, he wasn't a lawyer, he was a street guy who had just affection. He had great affection for the youth. So Bob McCullough said, "Well you hold that forty dollars. We will buy it. We will put up the trophy." He said, "Now we can start a camp fund." So Abe Margolies-- a great, great human being who owned Les Champs restaurant-- gave us the restaurant free, gave us the food free, gave us everything free. And that's how we started. That Monday he told me to come down to his office, he gave me a check for fifteen hundred dollars to start us off. So the first year we sent twenty kids away to camp. The second year we sent thirty-three. Today, I figure this summer we should be able to send fifty to fifty-five kids away to camp. And some of these kids have not-- they've never been away. They do not know what it's like to be away. Here's a letter that I received from one of the kids: "Thank you for making it possible for me to go to camp Minisink. Leaving on the ninth of August. I still think that I'm dreaming because after my father got hurt I knew I wouldn't be able to go anyplace this summer. Now I'm so excited I can't wait to get there. Thank you again for making my summer complete."

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:17:56.800
That's really beautiful. We're talking this evening with Eddie Younger. He was a board member of the Harlem Professionals Incorporated and is one of the founders of the John Hunter Memorial Camp Fund. A procedure that they use is to use the Hall of Fame honoring Black old-timers in sport as a mechanism for raising funds to send Harlem youth and other inner-city youth to camp. Those in the audience who might be interested in following up on this should contact the John Hunter Memorial Camp Fund at f 0 8 0 5 3 4. That's f 0 8 0 5 3 4 for information about the John Hunter Memorial Camp Fund. And Eddie that letter that you read really sort of says it all. It says that you and your colleagues reached out to the youth of the inner city and have said, "Look we are going to do something to help make life better for you." And of course the other part of the circle which I believe you emphasize is that when youth get the experience and have the opportunity to do this, they have the obligation to do it to someone else, to help someone else.

Eddie Younger 00:19:06.961
Correct--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:19:06.963
And that's the "each one teach one"--

Eddie Younger 00:19:08.430
"Each one teach one"--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:19:09.300
--"reach back and help" philosophy that we need in our Black communities. As we were saying before we went on the air, the drugs and the degradation and the school drop-outs that we face-- and as I say, and you say, the Harlems of the world, the Harlems of this country, are such that those of us who are Black with white allies like Abe Margolies and others need to reach out and do more to expand, to extend, to help our young people to understand that the way to success isn't through the streets and isn't through drugs and isn't through dropping out of school, but the way to success is through trying. And one of the elements of trying is to try and support. And that's really what Black athletes like yourself have done through the Harlem Professionals and through the John Hunter Memorial Camp Fund.

Eddie Younger 00:20:03.651
Well just like you were talking about the "each one teach one". You know you have the Bill Bradleys coming up there talking to the kids. You have the Cal Ramseys coming up there. You have everyone coming up there. Those that beat the system like the Cal Ramseys, the Ed Warners, the Floyd Laynes. They come back and sort of lift up-- come back in and lift up a brother. And does this pitch to the kids and show them that they can make it. Give them some encouragement so that they can go put a step forward. And in turn we're also hoping that these same kids when they go to school they will come back and lift up another brother. And it's just "each one teach one", that's the meaning of it all.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:20:42.850
And of course it has to be reinforced, and part of the background of "each one teach one" is we say, "You don't know where you're going unless you know where you've been."

Eddie Younger 00:20:51.470
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:20:52.261
So part of knowing where you've been is to honor some of the Black old-timers in sport. Possibly you could tell us some of the other athletes whom you've honored in the Harlem Professionals' Hall of Fame? I know I went to a luncheon a year or so ago and I was very pleased to see you honored an all-Black basketball team from Virginia Union that had been the best Black college team many, many years ago long before Black teams played in competition with white teams.

Eddie Younger 00:21:22.380
Yes well, in 1973 we put in George Gregory, as I told you before, for his Black college All-American, and original collegians which is old-timers like Joe Steele, Crip Romney, Al Eldridge-- that group. They won 103 straight games. They're the first Black team ever to play at Madison Square Garden in 1927. They won the AAU championship. We came back--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:21:46.070
That's one that we didn't know. That's very interesting. This team was the first Black team to play at Madison Square Garden in 1927, and they were called the Harlem Collegians--

Eddie Younger 00:21:54.810
The original collegians--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:21:55.261
The original collegians.

Eddie Younger 00:21:59.011
They beat the St. John's "One to Five". People do not know that. Then in nineteen--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:02.312
Course a lot of people don't know who the St. John's "One to Five" was--

Eddie Younger 00:22:03.780
[laughs]

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:04.821
The St. John's "One to Five" was from St. John's University which was very interesting in that St. John's was a Catholic institution yet they had a number of people who weren't Catholic on the team--

Eddie Younger 00:22:16.000
Correct--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:16.321
--and did a tremendous task in winning games as part of this pluralism that we reflect in sports and reflect in New York. So when people talk about the "One to Five", basketball certainly has changed. They used to have the center jump and all that kind of--

Eddie Younger 00:22:30.810
Played in a cage--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:31.481
--and the scores were like--

Eddie Younger 00:22:31.714
--[laughs] the referee outside the cage--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:32.347
-- twenty-nine to twenty-six, or something like that. But the world has changed. But at the time when you're first playing at sport, whatever it is, and you're the top, you are the top. And I think it's very important for our audience to know that as far back as 1927 the top AAU team was a Black team.

Eddie Younger 00:22:53.310
--was a Black team. We came back in 1974. We inducted the great legendary Paul Robeson.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:22:58.890
Now that is a story. The story of Paul Robeson is a story that not only is a story that has sports impact but has far greater human and political impact because here's a man who was crucified because of his political beliefs, a man of great artistic talent, a man of great humanistic concern, a man of great sports talent. And you did do the thing. And I know Bob Douglas was related to this as well because he knew Paul Robeson. You did do the thing that honored Paul Robeson for his fantastic sports exploits: an All-American at Rutgers in football; a letterman in baseball and track, in boxing and in basketball; a Phi Beta Kappa; and then going on to win the great awards of the Broadway stage.

Eddie Younger 00:23:44.880
Did you know that the one fellow that picked All-American when Paul Robeson was playing-- rather than pick eleven and put Paul Robeson on there, he picked ten?

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:23:52.323
[laughs] Is that [unintelligible] true--

Eddie Younger 00:23:52.330
[laughs] He picked ten and he refused to put Paul Robeson's name down and he couldn't put anyone else's name there in his place. So after Paul Robeson--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:24:03.270
You know, Eddie, you know sometimes when you hear a story like that you really wonder just how deep racism must run when somebody can just violate the basic [laughs] instincts of intelligence and humanity to do something like that. Those of us who are Black have seen it happen over and over again but every time you hear something as stupid as that, you really have to reflect on the depth with which racism penetrates our society.

Eddie Younger 00:24:30.570
We also inducted Althea Gibson, Jackie Robinson, Reverend Johnny Johnson, the first Black player at Columbia, the first Black college All-American team in 1939. It's the first team that was picked by the Pittsburgh Courier. I don't know, it was-- they went through I think it was 100, 110 sportswriters picked this team.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:24:53.701
This was an all-Black team?

Eddie Younger 00:24:54.990
It's an all-Black team-- the Black colleges in 1939. We got this out of the Sean Berry collection. It's up there for the youth to go up there and look and to see who these pioneers were. We had the players from Virginia Union, we had the players from Clark, from Atlanta, Georgia, and all the various colleges throughout the South that formed this team. They picked ten men and we honored them last year along with Joe Lewis.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:25:24.150
Now one of the things that comes to mind as we talk about Blacks in sport is whether, as we look at the accomplishments of our Black sports heroes of the past, our young people who are going into sports-- into the major sports-- recognize their obligation to their people, recognize their obligation to help other young people. Because so much of what we read is multimillion dollar contracts and young high school kids running out and buying Mach Fours and all kind of clothes the minute they sign. To what extent are you and other Black athletes of yesteryear trying to influence the Black athlete of today to have a greater degree of social responsibility?

Eddie Younger 00:26:15.920
What we preach-- what we've been trying to get the athletes of today to do-- to come back and give something back into the community. You received so much from the community. I think it's an obligation on their part to come back and contribute something to the community as far as giving these kids, these children, hope. Telling them that-- stay in school, leave the drugs alone. All these kids-- these kids come up-- they're looking at the Cadillacs and the Mercedes Benz. And they are the ones-- these guys, the drug sellers-- are the ones that receive the respect from the police, they're the ones they have all the girlfriends. So these kids when they come up on to this, this is all they see. Now if we can get some of these athletes to come back and show them the other side of it-- this is the point. I think that we can really change some of the ideas that these kids have, that the monetary things-- it just doesn't make sense. Just to look at-- want a big house, and a big Cadillac, a big Mercedes, and all these material things. There's something that you have to-- you have to live within yourself. You have to help your brother. You have to help your community. And these athletes can come back and still [unintelligible] to these kids heads. I think we'll have a better society.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:27:38.270
I think that's a beautiful note on which to close our program because it's certainly true from the intensity of the feeling that you project in those words, and the things that you and others in the Harlem Professionals are doing to help not only honor Black old-timers in sport, but to convey this word of self-help, and "each one teach one", and reach back and help their brother. I'd like to thank our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason", Eddie Younger of the New York City Department of Recreation and The Harlem Professionals.

Eddie Younger 00:28:07.401
It was my pleasure, Dr. Brown. I'm glad you invited me.
