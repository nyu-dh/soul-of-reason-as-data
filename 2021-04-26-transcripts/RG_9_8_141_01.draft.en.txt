Speaker 1 00:00:01.480
Discrimination in housing is one of the last bastions of overt racism. Federal law prohibits discrimination in housing but until now these laws have been meaningless. Hear what Dr. Gloria toot. Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is doing to make these laws work on tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 2 00:00:47.320
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:08.260
With us this evening on soul of reason is Dr. Gloria toot who is assistant secretary at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development better known as HUD.

Speaker 1 00:01:18.070
Glad to have you with us tonight. Larry I'm delighted to be with you. Now a good deal of your work as assistant secretary falls in the area of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. And as we said at the top of the show since housing discrimination is so virulent in the United States you have a tremendous task. And could you just run down for our audience a little bit about the virulence of racial and sex discrimination in housing as it stands today.

Speaker 4 00:01:44.440
Well it's still a problem and it is indeed I think the last bastion in the area of civil rights. It is a very sensitive area of our society of today because many people feel that they have the right to to live where they choose and to select their neighbors and the law does not preclude that but it states quite clearly that the national policy of this federal government is that there be the freedom of choice for all Americans to live where they please. But the problem is so extensive that it was necessary for Congress in 1968 to pass the federal Fair Housing Law which precludes discrimination in the area of housing that law was just amended in 1974. The latter part to include discrimination based upon sex in the past at my office was able to handle complaints of housing discrimination by minority women but not able to handle complaints of discrimination by non minority women in the area of housing.

Speaker 3 00:02:43.270
For example what would constitute discrimination in housing by sex. Does this deal with a landlord who won't rent to children. Do women who have children. Does it relate to landlords who won't rent to single women or to aged women.

Speaker 5 00:02:58.780
Is this the type of thing that's involved in the law as written by Congress does not relate to gender of sex therefore it also protects the rights of men who may be discriminated against but basically the complaints that we are receiving was where a woman applies for a home and has her own means of income your own employment which would be equal to that of a male candidate for that same home and yet she is denied that home based upon the fact that she is a woman and longevity in the employment market is question usually upon the basis of the possibility of becoming pregnant. In fact these cases case filed before my office where I went to a bank to receive a mortgage for it to purchase a house and the bank adjuster said well and it's true that your income is adequate. You have longevity on your job. In fact you have a contract but you're married and we're afraid you may become pregnant and that would take you out of the labor market. Do you contemplate if you become pregnant having an abortion.

Speaker 3 00:04:03.590
Oh it's certainly an invasion of privacy to say the least as well as just blatant sex discrimination a violation now of Title 8. Now what happens. And I know this is something that people were concerned with a Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and anti-discrimination laws always raised. What happens if in fact a lending agency or landlord or rental agency does discriminate in terms of sex or race. What can be done.

Speaker 5 00:04:32.680
Well the individual may have a dual course of action one they may file a complaint directly with HUD with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in a place like New York. They would file the complaint with the State Commission Against for human rights to file the complaint with HUD. We would refer it to the state commission. We do so because Title 8 which by the way establish my office as a subcabinet post of government which shows a concern of Congress and also shows that Congress intends that the Office of responsibility have sufficient powers to bring redress to the public to file with the department is only handled by my investigatory staff where there is no state or local agency which has a law and an administration of its law that is not equivalent to ours where the state has a law and an agency as you have here in New York. We refer those cases because the state has responsibility also.

Speaker 6 00:05:25.870
Now we've had representatives most recently Courtney Brown of The New York State Division of Human Rights on our program and one of the things that comes up is that even where complaints are filed it takes a long period of negotiation Asian interaction and state governments and massive municipal governments and certainly the federal government are very loath to take that last step which is some type of legal action.

Speaker 3 00:05:52.620
It's not force you to get into that apartment.

Speaker 4 00:05:55.930
It's not a question of that. When I said that the person has a dual option they may go directly into court because title it gives them that option of filing a matter before the federal district court. Not only me they go into court but they may then ask that the court preemptively place the case on the calendar which means no undue delay. The court has one power which my office does not have which is the power to restrain the disposition of the property which means that when a case or a complaint is filed before the department even though we handle it as expeditiously as possible we have no way of preventing that person who has allegedly violated the rights of an American citizen. We have no way of saying don't dispose of that property until this matter is concluded. On the other hand we talk about delay we must bear in mind that any allegation of discrimination requires a thorough investigation. In fact my staff and investigators throughout the country are as competent as investigators for Internal Revenue Secret Service or the FBI. We must identify that it is indeed a violation that has occurred a violation of Title 8 and we must be certain that the person who has allegedly violated the law has done so. We must act in a quasar judicial manner.

Speaker 7 00:07:10.840
Let me ask this.

Speaker 6 00:07:12.710
Sometimes people who didn't want to deny housing use questions of morality and they apply them unjustly to blacks and Hispanics and women for example say of these people do certain things in this house.

Speaker 8 00:07:30.130
That might be illegal or derive their income from illegal sources.

Speaker 7 00:07:35.020
Now that's sort of complicated because it really brings in another issue now. Does discrimination based on alleged immorality of the prospective tenant or purchaser fall under the aegis of this act that can only be determined again by investigation and might well let us take the example where an attractive young woman an attractive woman.

Speaker 4 00:07:59.990
Let's forget age applies.

Speaker 9 00:08:01.710
Like there's another kind of discrimination we have to deal with.

Speaker 4 00:08:04.260
Yes I had that has responsibility for the Department internally. But let's take the case where a woman applies for a home or apartment which is a rather expensive one and we find that it is denied to her. And why just assume that possibly she might be a prostitute and therefore they do not accept. They don't even check to see whether or not a balance in the bank is adequate. I encountered a similar problem myself where I now live in Washington. I have a two bedroom apartment because one room I use as a study to work in and I asked for a phone to be placed in every room including my dining room because I'm on 24 hour duty as a flag officer so the federal government and yet management refused to give me to allow those phones to be installed while I was at the office and he said Well no woman who's not in business needs that many phones no matter if you got the wrong person. Well that that would fall under the aegis of my office. But again we really must investigate these matters to determine really whether it is a violation of Title 8 or a violation of some other law where my office does not have responsibility. We then refer to the appropriate government agency whether it be state or federal for remedial action. But I should say the title 8 covers race color religion sex and national origin because I find that it will vary depending upon the geographic area where you are now.

Speaker 10 00:09:24.490
Has the climate in the country among the people changed enough to reasonably expect that fair housing will become a reality rather than a series of dreams and a series of legislative acts. It's true the Congress responds to the will of the people allegedly but it's also true that because of the pressure of minority groups in our society Congress sometimes runs ahead of people and I'm sure that there are many people who are listening to this program say well why should anyone be forced to live next to someone they don't want to live next to regardless of who they might be. So as you travel around the country I'm sure you've been in all 50 states and three or four territories as well. What do you find in terms of the mood of the people at large.

Speaker 11 00:10:16.210
Toward fair housing people are rather recalcitrant. First of all I don't think minorities themselves are aware that one they have the right to demand two to live according to their own wishes in a community that they select. Secondly it is the fear of bodily harm that might be inflicted either upon the adults or the children. So again that is the adult why would you even not be there.

Speaker 7 00:10:43.230
Oh the fear of bodily harm because the white majority might discourage them. For example in New York recently we had a bombing raid in one of the suburban communities and it has created a sort of a second look at fair housing and the hearts and minds of people in our society.

Speaker 11 00:11:04.880
You have many corporate executives who will say to you I'm quite liberal. We have many minorities working in this corporation at high level positions male and female. What if I inquired Do you have any neighbors who are minorities a look at me in shock they think for a moment and then they say no and they never know why that answer is No. And yet minorities now economically can really afford to live across this nation and we do not. The patterns and practices are in place and unless there is an overt concern by all Americans not simply by minorities and not simply by the federal government but by all Americans as to the problems that are incidents to the inspection of minorities and the poor in specific geographic areas without this concern there can be no corrective action. I think the problem of busing today and I recognize full well that an integrated society would require no busing. I look at the problem of services and in particular when I look at Newark and I see that that is a city without economic viability and yet it is a haven for nothing but the poor and for nothing but minorities. The economic base of a city is it is dependent upon its economic mix and also its racial mix and minorities will always suffer the problems of inferior schools inferior services including police and sanitation unless they are in an open community. For I find that public officials are always concerned about the services they give to non minorities and yet it's an afterthought as it relates to minorities because it raises a number of answering questions.

Speaker 10 00:12:47.460
As you know many large cities have black mayors Detroit Newark Atlanta Gary just to mention a few and it's alleged that we blacks finally get a chance to run for these positions and to win them. When the city begins to run down economically and becomes predominantly black on the other hand many of the black nationalists or people who believe in the kind of pan African or pan Afro American movement suggests well it's not really bad for black people to cluster together and to live together and to work together and that even within the black community you have various economic strata but it still could be all black. How do you relate to these type of concerns recognizing that federal law does speak in terms of integration yet recognizing too that in many instances blacks and some black intellectuals feel that it's better for black people to stick together and we shouldn't spend so much time fighting for integration.

Speaker 4 00:13:52.500
Well Title 8 the Federal law calls for open housing which means freedom of choice and that becomes significant to those who wish to live amongst themselves. That is the exercise of freedom of choice. But then there is also the responsibility to have a greater involvement and commitment to see that the needs of that community and admit to to make certain that their educational system is run adequately with an adequate tax base to make certain that their children had the benefits of all other societies. And I frequently when I talk to an adult I'm more concerned with whether or not they are aware of what an impacted area of minority means to children. We as adults have the opportunity as a result of having to leave our community for normally for our work and for even our entertainment and pleasure.

Speaker 11 00:14:41.460
We have an opportunity to enjoy all of Americana. There is a part of Americana that is also minority or black and that you can only find or subconsciously enjoy where black people are. But there's another part of life and we must be totally knowledgeable of Americana and the tools of success and those tools cannot be learned simply with our own.

Speaker 3 00:15:06.240
Well let's go back to this political idea that one of the reasons why we've gotten more black congressmen and more black mayors and more black state representatives is that areas that are predominantly black now because of the Voting Rights Act and the reapportionment act now a reported decision now are required to have the same number of people as reflected in their population. And if in fact we had a integrated mix since we were 11 12 13 percent of the population if we had true integration basically we would have a difficult time maintaining political power. So some of some of the folk I'm not advocating this. I'm not presenting the argument. Some people mentioned some of the black leaders feel that it really is better for black people to try to develop their own viable communities including a viable economic base and that really worry so much about integrating other communities.

Speaker 9 00:16:04.050
I know this puts you right on the spot as a secretary. But that's part of being a secretary.

Speaker 4 00:16:08.410
It doesn't bother me if you're talking about the kind of community that that the Muslims have to follow. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD That's a viable community. It has an economic base. There is concern there is discipline. Oh yes that's highly successful.

Speaker 12 00:16:23.460
But there is also another means of securing political power and that is being a balance of power with the vote here in New York City. We indeed can be that rather than all of all the majority of black people in New York being Democrats. If we were nothing neither Republican or Democrat. And we were that that power bloc that swung the pendulum then we would have power. And yet that power would not be with impacting within a city again without economic viability. But you find that industry major industry runs away from any government that seems to be either controlled by minorities or in a completely minority area.

Speaker 7 00:17:07.980
If right of course that means that we have a tremendous challenge and as an assistant secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity you are right on the forefront of this type of challenge which then leads me to ask the question exactly what are you doing in your department to implement this federal law dealing with discrimination against housing as well as to implement the principle of fair housing.

Speaker 13 00:17:33.540
Well when I became assistant secretary we had a backlog of title eight complaints. We have reduced that backlog. We are have increased the time span for investigation and conciliation. We have increased the amount of awards received from those who violate Title 8 in conciliation efforts.

Speaker 3 00:17:52.200
We have an example of one of those types of awards.

Speaker 11 00:17:55.190
Well we attempt to do two things One to secure a compensation to the person whose rights have been violated the federal courts are now and some state courts are interpreting the act of discrimination upon the person as a tort to lawyers this is significant is no longer treated as a case in equity where the damages is one dollar and the person who has violated the law is admonished. But now we have been able in addressing this matter before members of the Bar Association not simply minority Bar Association but just the bar association in general to do two things one to say that when a child sees their parent discriminated against that child and that spouse lose a degree of respect for that individual which may never return. And that individual he or she also suffers a trauma to the person that may never be regained and therefore the courts are now accepting this philosophy. We have funded contracts for the preparation of a legal bibliography of current cases in this area so that those complainants who seek legal redress directly will have attorneys who will have available in their law libraries the tools with which to champion their cause. We have attempted to deal with society in general and have this as open discussion let us discuss the problems of housing today that is no longer hiding under the table.

Speaker 4 00:19:19.280
And I think most significantly is the fact that for the first time in the history one my staff has been increased although the department staff was reduced because the president President Ford has said he is going to keep that federal budget down so he will. And so he has reduced the staff of the total department but he has increased the staff of my office and we train that staff professionally for the first time we hired contractors who were competent in training other federal investigators and now my investigators are as competent as others which means we will move with greater speed and greater professionalism. Aside from that we are going to now this year evaluate all laws across the country by state and local government as they relate to housing to make certain that they properly protect the rights of their citizens and where they are inadequate either in budget or in technique to provide the technical assistance to help local government protect the rights of its citizens.

Speaker 7 00:20:13.020
And I guess I could go on and on and one thing is very apparent from what you say. First of all your commitment is apparent but also the fact that you're moving into the legal arena and developing the technical expertise so that minorities and women can fight this through the courts it reflects at least as far as I'm concerned a commitment on your part.

Speaker 8 00:20:32.760
And I guess in parentally a commitment on the federal government's part and of course since federal government is us it really should be what we ought to be doing and then going beyond that I can see that one of the things is mobilizing the resources to deal with this massive issue when you get something as pervasive as discrimination in housing. It start from point zero or minus 10 to move up requires tremendous amount of activity. And I know that you're planning a conference in April sometime on fair housing.

Speaker 3 00:21:05.510
I imagine from what I hear about the conference that you're going to invite representatives of fair housing organizations so that they can gain some of this expertise that your staff is putting together.

Speaker 5 00:21:17.690
Well this meeting in April and Title 8 was signed in April so we make that fair housing month. As for this meeting will relate with civil rights and fair housing organizations around the country and we will attempt to advise them of means to secure funding for monitoring activity. My staff is really not large enough and yet considering the size of most compliance or in law enforcement offices of the federal government whether they be in a arena of civil rights or in general areas of enforcement it is a sizable staff. My personal staff is far larger than total staff of the FCC but nonetheless the local organizations or the public has a role to play unfortunately because of the economic climate we find that the major organizations that give grants to fair housing organizations have reduced their funding.

Speaker 8 00:22:08.310
Now does that reflect for instance because does that really reflect a lack of commitment on the part of these large organization and the larger society. Because in a sense it seems like sort of a cop out that you start people moving toward moving into the mainstream and the minute the economy drops back a little of the Dow Jones average drops a few points. You say no we can't fund that anymore and they are on their own. I know that's a hard question particularly as a federal official and I could just make it as a comment and you can just go right out.

Speaker 11 00:22:36.550
Know I'd be responsive to that. I think that now the because of the economic climate in the dollar is very very tight. Your major corporations are no longer making the large gifts to your philanthropic organizations your philanthropic organizations in the past many of them did not have a sound fiscal policy of making grants to public organizations of X number of dollars but investing some of that money that they collected. So they would be an ongoing business operation as a result many of them are over extended. On the other hand I have a close working relationship with both Mr. Meany which represents our unions and corporations throughout America. I am asking corporations that when they go to move a plant or a facility they not move that plant to a community unless there is open housing. If it does exist fine if it does not then say to local government I will not take my money and invest it in this community that will not house all of my employees and they are doing it. So again it is a part of our economic climate today.

Speaker 8 00:23:37.670
And also it's part of what the federal government can do to provide leadership both moral leadership and technical leadership. And I think the type of thing you said about what you say to corporations and move into new communities about open housing is a very good example of the moral leadership of the federal government and I imagine you can give them some technical assistance so they can help to make some of these local communities more responsive or for the public who hears this.

Speaker 11 00:23:59.990
Let me say that I also insist that the federal government. I insist that no new facility be built in any area where there is not open housing and low and moderate income housing which of course has great impact upon minorities and all moved by the federal government are reviewed by my office when it is contemplated we make an evaluation of the housing market in the area proposed and we've been rather successful to preclude some movement of facilities in those areas where we find open housing lacking.

Speaker 8 00:24:30.800
Of course I think this is one of the clear examples of why it's important have blacks and other minorities in Cabinet level positions are in as you say flag level positions in the various parts of federal state and municipal government because even though you may not agree with every one of the policies of that government the fact that you are there can protect and extend the interest of minorities in this instance black people. Could you just so summarize a little bit more on exactly what's going to happen in April as fair housing.

Speaker 4 00:25:01.940
Well I hope that we've called together some very skilled technicians throughout America the skills of various areas.

Speaker 13 00:25:10.490
Our concern is that the grants to state and local government and the means of funding by the federal government is now by the block grant approach and you give it to your local government your state government you say protect the rights of your citizens meet the needs of your citizens. This is a form of revenue sharing form of revenue sharing while we refer to it indeed the Department particularly with our new housing community development act we refer to it as a block grant funding not title one of our new housing act which by the way count poverty twice in allocating funds to state and local government and that is to make certain that the needs of the poor are met. We by statute or at least Congress by statutes statute clearly says that fair housing or title aid activity can be funded. Now we must design the technique for local organizations to go to state and local government and ask for funds so they can help the federal government fulfill its obligation of open housing for all Americans.

Speaker 8 00:26:03.240
Now in this conference I gather that one of the ideas is to help these fair housing organizations to know how to do this and not only to understand the law and the complexities of the law and understanding how to fill out the forms but also what might be called grants mentorship. How do you put the pressure in the right place to get your particular proposal. Your particular project approved precisely and I believe you have some people from all over the country of various ethnic backgrounds organizational backgrounds etc. Working with your division your staff to help plan this conference.

Speaker 13 00:26:38.580
I do. We're very fortunate to have some of these. Certainly some of the highest caliber of technicians in grants mentorship government funding and fair housing in the legal complexities of funding my state and local government. We have a mayor two city councilmen. I think it's going to be very meaningful.

Speaker 8 00:26:56.520
Well one last question.

Speaker 7 00:26:58.170
If someone were to ask you what is the most important single thing you can do other than having Gloria Toot and heard speaking up as she's doing tonight.

Speaker 8 00:27:08.820
What is the most important single thing that can be done either by government or by corporations or by individuals to bring about fair housing.

Speaker 13 00:27:15.660
What would you say to be concerned enough to always be aware when there is a denial of the rights of any person protected by Title. When you walk into a bank there should be a pledge on the wall that is required by law which recited that bank will not discriminate in financing as it relates to housing. When one walks into a real estate office that same sign should be there when that sign is not seen then reported as a complaint to the Department. We have a toll free number which anyone can call daily long distance operator and receive record is that number that is 8 0 0 0 4 3 4 8 5 8 0 4 0 8 0 0 0. It's a toll for how it's tied to what's not right. What's line number. But again you can simply call the long distance information operator for that free number in Washington D.C. for HUD.

Speaker 8 00:28:04.500
All right. I think that's a good point in which to close our discussion about what's being done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to bring about fair housing.

Speaker 14 00:28:13.320
Our guest tonight on soul of reason has been Dr. Gloria etude assistant secretary of HUD and has told us a tremendous amount about what's being done to bring about equal opportunity and fair housing for all you've been listening to soul of reason with your host the director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. and featuring a distinguished guest voicing the black experience.
