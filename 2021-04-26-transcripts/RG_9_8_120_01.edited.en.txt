New York City's budget crisis has had tremendous impact on services to the City's Black, Hispanic and poor populations. Here Dr. John Holloman, President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, discussed the effect of the City's fiscal crisis on healthcare for New York City's residents on tonight's Soul of Reason.

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:40.511
This is "Soul of Reason", a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:07.720
Our guest on tonight's :Soul of Reason" is Dr. John L. S. Holloman who is President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. And as you know he's been in the news quite recently and quite frequently because of the situation in terms of the funding of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. So Mike, and we call Dr.Holloman Mike, Mike, I'd like to ask you to begin the discussion tonight by talking about your view of the future of healthcare for the poor in New York City and then put that in perspective of the fiscal crisis of the city.

John L. S. Holloman 00:01:40.360
All right. Thanks for letting me share my views with you. The Health and Hospitals Corporation certainly has been responsible for providing care for more than 52 percent of the patients who are ambulatory in the city of New York institutionally cared for. Certainly much of the Emergency Medical Services has been provided vis-a-vis the Health and Hospitals Corporations' ambulances and facilities. As I look to the future, the future is at least uncertain. It depends on the new policies of the new administration in Washington, whether or not we are going to be able to get national funding which will be sufficient to provide the services that are so necessary not only for the poor but for all of us. It's awfully important to remember that with the escalating healthcare costs and the limited money available, ,that we're going to have to have some provisions to divide this limited care among all of the citizens. I look forward to national health insurance. I look forward to a national health insurance that will bring about some changes in the healthcare delivery system. Specifically as we look at New York City, the Health and Hospitals Corporation is particularly controversial because it isn't competition. It is in direct competition for scarce funds with the private and voluntary sectors. These sectors certainly are politically stronger than the Health and Hospitals Corporation is and has been, and therefore perhaps has they have more friends at court. Anything that is related or perceived to be charity in this is a tremendous misconception because everything in the corporation basically is paid for one way or the other, but because it's perceived as having had charitable origins we think that because it's private because it's voluntary that it's automatically better. This is certainly not so. The principal problem has been, and will be, a need to educate the public to recognize that 78 percent of all of the funds expended for health are either tax related or related to the philanthropic tax exempt dollars. And therefore the public needs to have a better control, needs to have a greater input into what happens to the dollars. And this is true in New York City. The expenditure of funds without public accountability is the great problem with the private voluntary sector. The problem of the municipal hospitals and the Health and Hospitals Corporation is a problem of image and understanding. The need to recognize that the voluntary sector could not exist and could not exist as we know it if it did not have the floor that's placed there by the municipal hospitals. Those services which are unprofitable and the private and voluntary sector are dumped into the municipal sector. Those services which are profitable are creamed out and it's been going on and it's been going on particularly since World War II.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:44.720
Of course your analysis which is really quite insightful raises a number of questions of public policy. For example, you point out that the majority, say 78 percent of the money for healthcare, is paid for through either tax supported dollars or tax exempt dollars, which really means you're talking about a relatively small amount of money relatively speaking in terms of just individual free dollars. At the same time you point up that there's a competition between the municipal hospital system and what you call the private. So the voluntary hospital system which means that they too have to have money in order to survive. And you further suggest that because the municipal hospital system takes what you might call the high risk or the high cost type activities it gives the voluntary and private hospitals a chance to balance their budgets and keep in operation. Yet at the same time you find the municipal hospital system being criticized because it is a drag on the overall city's economy. The overall City budget. So that Big Mac, Municipal Assistance Corporation, is saying to you "Look we don't like your plan for a so-called balancing the budget and therefore we think that we ought to do something about the management of the Corporation. Yes And of course you're saying that regardless of certain administrative changes which can occur in every organization. You're really saying that it is really a basic question of how do we pay for health care for people. And as I would read into your analysis if we don't pay for the Health and Hospitals Corporation these poor people, these people who are at the low end of the economic spectrum, will not get any or adequate health service.

John L. S. Holloman 00:06:25.530
This is true. The Emergency Financial Control Board which is monitoring the three year plan which is basically being made at the expense of the less affluent half of the population, specifically the poor. These people are really guilty of not having given the Corporation a fair day in court. We've never had the opportunity to talk with them, to present our plans in detail. They've had the opportunity on the part of certain congressmen to do a political thing, a hatchet job on management. The fact that the Corporation last year and for the last three years has succeeded in balancing its budget and was perfectly on time until some panels decided that there should be some alterations in the plan. Then the State of New York decided to violate the plan by reducing the Medicaid reimbursement and the problems that we have therefore are external to the Corporation so far as the finances are concerned rather than being a result as has been charged of poor management. The management of course in any institution that is underfunded and large can be probably improved. But the big problem is the under financing. And to have the State which charges us with being fiscally irresponsible be directly responsible for our fiscal plight and then to enjoy the immunity that they seem to have is is wrong.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:02.401
Well how, what is the technical basis of the state reducing your reimbursement rate?

John L. S. Holloman 00:08:07.320
The technical basis is that the State wants to contain the Medicaid expenditures which do provide about 60 percent of the Corporation's revenue. And this is an unfortunate thing because I feel that it is discriminatory since our Medicaid rate on the average was reduced about 5 percent by the State at the same time three quarters of the voluntary and private institutions were being increased, were being increased in their Medicaid rate on the average of 6 percent. Any time that we have this kind of an end result regardless of the regulations that produce it, and in my opinion this is a discriminatory act. And we are seeking relief of it through the courts. We had to go to court as you know fairly recently just to get a new hospital which many people felt was too good for poor people opened because the Health and Hospitals, I'm sorry the State Department of Health, and those people who are responsible for those governmental decisions decided that they wanted to give that to the private and voluntary sector.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:10.560
The public's responsibility here is to see to it that this doesn't happen. This is the Black population, the white population, the poor population, Hispanic population. Apparently you as you suggest that there's more publicity being given to the position that says that the Health and Hospitals Corporation is a spendthrift and that the private hospitals could take care of all of the healthcare the poor et cetera.

John L. S. Holloman 00:09:35.640
Yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:35.911
How can the public help to save the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and the services that it provides?

John L. S. Holloman 00:09:43.560
I think it's important that the public speak up now, speak to the elected officials let them know that they recognize the services that are rendered by the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Let them know that they are not fooled and will not be fooled by the propaganda about the problems of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Let them let the public tell all of those who are concerned that public accountability is absolutely necessary. The if you look at the way monies are expended there is no such thing as a private or voluntary hospital because they all exist and must be responsible to the public.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:20.580
Now when you say public accountability I imagine you are suggesting that there should be some public surveillance of the operation of the private and voluntary hospitals. They might retort by saying that they have a board composed of exemplary citizens who look this over. On the other hand your reports have to be public and totally in the public domain. To what extent are the reports etc. of the private involved in our hospitals available in the public domain and what is the nature of public surveillance?

John L. S. Holloman 00:10:51.170
The public surveillance is I think unfortunately quite similar to the public surveillance by this technical agency that gave us Willowbrook and the Medicaid scandals and any of a number of areas they can pick on the Health and Hospitals Corporation and tar us with a broad brush management but they don't say anything about the fiscal accountability. Our auditor Arthur Andersen for instance, gave us a qualified report indicating tremendous managerial improvements. The voluntary hospitals do not experience the constant harassment and auditing that the Health and Hospitals Corporation does experience. We certainly have no problems with that. We are very happy. The problem is that we are now trying to operate a system after having lost within the past 18 20 months more than 7000 employees having been forced to close more than five hospitals all wholly or in part. And it's it's administering on a receding wave. Our managerial employees haven't even had a cost of living increase since nineteen hundred seventy three when all of the unions and the other employees have had these increases. So it's it's it's it's a rough managerial job and it's been done pretty well.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:03.501
Well you have an image problem as you indicated. And of course you have a sort of a circle that as you lose personnel and you can't provide as many of the services as you used to provide the same level then the public itself begin to say that hospital doesn't do it. And sometimes you do hear among poor people that I'd rather go to X hospital which is a private or volunteer than to go to a public hospital, which is an image problem. Yet as you pointed out earlier it is this very public hospital system that provides a basic medical care for the poor in the City. So how do you get out of that circle.

John L. S. Holloman 00:12:37.640
It's very difficult and very vicious circle to get out of because the very people who are most dependent are sometimes unaware of their dependency. Medicaid as you know is a very important program but there are thousands of people in the City of New York who are working and making more money than would allow them, than they are allowed to make and be eligible for Medicaid. These are the working poor and yet if they have illness they just cannot afford to pay for it. They don't have enough private insurance which is certainly not comprehensive to allow them outpatient care so that they have to seek care in the hospital field. Many of the physicians have left the inner cities and so the working poor are quite a drag on the healthcare delivery system.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:23.270
And of course that means that the poor people are working poor and I would say the middle class people have to be keenly aware of what the problem is in relationship to healthcare in New York City. And that is the reason why agencies like the American Public Health Association nationally and other national groups are looking at this problem, not just as a New York City problem but as a problem for the entire country.

John L. S. Holloman 00:13:46.310
Yes. Nationally the trend of course has been against municipal hospitals for the very reasons that we have here. And it's absolutely necessary as we look forward to a new healthcare delivery system, national health insurance that we protect the investment that the public has in its hospital system.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:04.040
And we're talking this evening with Dr. John Holloman who's president in New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and we were talking about the crisis in health care for the poor and how it relates to the fiscal situation in New York City. And as you were saying Mike, throughout the country there is beginning to be increased pressure for closing down or controlling the operation of municipal health facilities and I see this in sort of a total political perspective and that is a question that's come up frequently that all services education and health and welfare business employment programs can better be done by the private sector than the public sector. And as you point out very well the examples where the private sector shines are examples usually where the basic high risk service is underwritten by the public agency and for those of us who identify with the poor and with minority people ,who frequently are apt to be poor, it's very important that we understand what the issues are. And could you with that as a background examine the question that says that municipal services particularly, municipal hospital services, are wasteful, that we waste money, that we don't give the public the money the service for its buck etc. vis-a-vis the privates which allegedly do so much of a better job and particularly in the context of the fact that 78 percent of all healthcare is paid for by tax supported funds or tax exempt funds? Pick up from there and develop that point.

John L. S. Holloman 00:15:40.960
Yes I'd certainly, I certainly will. The public must realize that the services which are rendered in the private and voluntary sector are usually planned for the convenience of the provider. They usually are more costly in the long run and they are usually less comprehensive in that the people who are working poor are are excluded. This is certainly in the health area and the other areas the similar things do occur. The most important thing to remember though that if health care is to be a right and we believe this it has to be planned for. And the only way to plan for is to take the best that is available and to get the public accountability that we have in the municipal system to stop giving away to the non too tender mercies of the privates and voluntaries to do with what they will. I think it's a giveaway because some 60 billion dollars for instance comes into New York City from HEW and I'm certain that the public has no really real understanding of where that money is spent. When we talk about health dollars we're talking about a much smaller amount but the health dollars are expended in the Health and Hospitals Corporation are very very clearly accountable. They are not tax dollars per se but they're dollars that are earned and revenue just as the volunteer earns revenue. We also in the Health and Hospitals Corporation carry a disproportionately high share of the City's debt service. We are burdened in our budget with many things that are not directly related to health care.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:12.491
Now how does a debt service situation occur?

John L. S. Holloman 00:17:15.251
The debt service occurs because it's related to the fiscal problems of New York City. The fact that we have to pay to finance money perhaps hospitals as old as Fordham and Greenpoint and Cumberland and

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:28.241
Hospitals that were built about 25 30 years ago.

John L. S. Holloman 00:17:30.192
We're still paying debt service on these facilities. This is the type of thing that the public doesn't understand. They look at the institutions that are in the private sector the voluntary sector not realizing that they have the right to turn patients away if they don't have the money and that the hospitals are sometimes planned as we look on the East Side of Manhattan contiguous to each other and there are vast areas in Brooklyn, Bed Sty, South Bronx in which there are no institutions. It's this type of lack of planning, it's this wasteful planning that we see that we would lose complete control over if it were allowed to go completely into the voluntary sector.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:12.210
All right. You pointed out that in many instances health service provided by private and voluntary agencies is provided for the convenience of the provider or is planned for the convenience of the provider. In a sense this has been an allegation has been directed to public services as well. What is it in the mechanism of the Health and Hospital Corporation and other public health services that does provide for better planning and does provide for more public input? Because it appears to me that some things that have happened recently in the public sector are things that even public advocates would want to have happen. Yet your own board sometimes votes these things out. If I can be direct about it.

John L. S. Holloman 00:18:55.330
I have to be defensive about my board because they are impacted upon by outside forces many, many times and the board itself perhaps is maligned for things over which it may not have absolute control. The political process is still very much around us. There is a serious confrontation between the State and the City. We are currently being controlled by the Emergency Financial Control Board and I must say that the problems that are there are not always ones which are fair to the less affluent half the population and the need to get more understanding on the part of those who are in control at the present time of the tremendous impact that these economies that are being made are having on the Blacks and the Puerto Ricans and the poor in our city. The banks have their advocates and basically are protected. All of the financial stability has been in my opinion derived or directed at protecting the interests, and protecting the mortgage rate, protecting the bonding, but nothing has been done so far as the social commitment of our cities and of our government to the people who the government is supposed to be serving. And when we make it so that New York City is unlivable as certainly this three year plan is capable of doing we will have perhaps like we say in surgery, the operation was a success but the patient died. This three year plan is basically too drastic. The economies that are being forced on the Health and Hospitals Corporation are too drastic. We're cutting into the area now in which we are endangering the public that we are licensed and privileged to serve. It was I who first predicted three years ago, two years ago when these economies were forecast and were beginning to be forced upon us that we would reach a point in which the system would even collapse. We haven't reached that point yet but we are at a point where the ranks are spread so thinly that all of us are at greater risk and it's time we called a halt to this process and begin to regroup and to rebuild. If necessary we should extend the three year plan certainly the Health and Hospitals Corporation should not be forced to endure economies that are imposed on it from outside sources such as the State Department of Health and the City government.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:16.630
I know that you have been on "Soul of Reason" right from the day you took office as President of the Corporation and have talked about this particular problem, particularly the problem of the impact of the relationship between the private and voluntary hospitals on the public hospital system. But you've opened up a larger issue which does relate to the overall fiscal problem in New York City and the fact that practically everyone that we've had on the program people from areas and education people in areas of social service youth service etc. have pointed up that this fiscal crisis and the plan to balance the budget to right the fiscal ship of New York City has had tremendous impact on services to the poor. And many have said that the poor do not have advocates in this particular situation. The counter argument of course is that the reason why they had to save the banks as it were is that the banks would not be in a position to advance the money necessary to pay New York City's payroll and that New York City through a variety of mistakes now alleged to be mistakes such as very well negotiated labor contracts such as pension plans and the like have gotten itself into a position where it could no longer pay its bills. Now there are people including I believe Representative Shirley Chisholm who said it really been better for city went bankrupt and then argue with a federal judge who would be administering it according to the law that was passed at the time crisis began to see if we can't pressure that situation in saying well look these services have to remain and the banks have to hold back all the people who hold bonds because a lot of the indebtedness the City isn't necessarily the the banks it's also to some poor people who invested in some municipal bonds. I see what we are doing tonight on "Soul of Reason" as one of the things that needs to be done to educate the public so the public can clearly understand what the issues are. And you've made it quite clear in your public statements and your statements here tonight that you feel that if something's going to give it has to be the payment of the debts of New York City rather than the healthcare for people. Now the other people say well look we agree with that but you can do the job better. How do you respond to that?

John L. S. Holloman 00:23:35.410
Well I certainly think that the job can be done better on both sides. But what does it matter if we destroy the City. I think that fiscal responsibility is important, but there's nothing in it except an arbitrary determination that three years is a period of time that it has to be done in. If three years is too short a period of time then the soul of reason would dictate that it be stretched out to be a comfortable or more comfortable period of time so that at least we can survive but to destroy the best hospital system in the world, the municipal hospital system in New York is renowned, and it has the opportunity for glory. It does provide for all of New Yorkers this blanket of protection. At least it has up until now. And there's no point in giving this up. It's silly it's it's downright stupid. And to to give it up as we scramble for very petty narrow vested interests and very petty goals, and talk about being fiscally responsible while we're destroying citizens, and while we are endangering our lives. This is a course of action that we need, we need to call a halt to it. This was an act of our legislature that I call on our legislature to stand up and protect the citizens and to have some social concerns. New York City is great because of banks. Yes, but it's much greater because of people and unless we can take and express our concerns for our people and continue to make adequate provisions for their health, their lives, their safety, their education, and their housing, then we have failed. What good is a government that does not provide this for the citizens? And let's let's face up to the responsibility of government. It's to all of the citizens not to a privileged few or to a vested interest class or to just some of the health providers. It's for the health of all the people and this is what I'm talking about when I fight for the public health for the public hospital system in New York and throughout the country.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:27.491
Well you'd pointed out earlier that one of the big problems related to the fiscal position of the Corporation was the decrease in the Medicaid reimbursement rates. I believe according to some manipulations that occurred some months ago the rates would decrease for all hospitals but that I understand also that your rates would decrease even more. By you I mean New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation's rates would decrease proportionately more. What can be done to bring that reimbursement back to the level that it should be particulary in terms of its comparison with the private and voluntary hospitals?

John L. S. Holloman 00:26:03.380
If we simply got the rate in which we had agreed upon at the time our three year plan was made we would be much more fiscally solvent for the coming years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:13.631
Well what what was the technical basis of changing that rate? The technical basis was a switch in which we were compared to the lowest common denominator. By giving us rates that compared to the smaller hospitals rather than rates which would compare to the composite which always commands a larger rate. We are a composite as created by an act of the same state legislature. And yet the State Department of Health elected to give us individual rates and therefore the average of the small individual units of our hospitals gave us a reduced rate of one hundred ninety seven dollars as contrasted to the projected rate and promised and agreed upon rate of two hundred sixteen dollars and sixty eight cents. That gave us a 26 million dollar problem and it's one which was superimposed on all the economies that had already been made. And this is the reason for the charges of mismanagement. But it's not mine it's theirs. Oh. you make a very good point. As you develop the relationship between the rates based on the smaller and the larger hospitals. What about the suggestion that the system would be better off if it were decentralized? If you didn't have a centralized bureaucracy running it? Do you think that that would work?

John L. S. Holloman 00:27:18.020
Certainly there are some areas that we could decentralize but could you imagine having a 16 110 different ambulance districts so could you imagine having a patient lying in the middle of the street right on the line between two districts and watching the ambulances on either side go by him in the Health and Hospitals Corporation we do provide this ambulance coverage largely for the city. We have centralized laundry. We have many areas of economy of scale through purchasing through through collections and billings perhaps that could be done much better locally. But there are some areas that certainly are best done centrally so just to use the word decentralized to decentralize is the broad brush.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:57.770
I can certainly see that but as you are fighting this fiscal crisis I'm sure you're also looking at the management of your own corporation. Have you undertaken to explore some of those areas where services might be decentralized?

John L. S. Holloman 00:28:10.940
Yes and we've proceeded to do this. What we don't get credit for are the managerial changes that we've already instituted. You have a new executive vice president. We have many changes at the senior level and the managerial changes are bringing about some improvement. Certainly to carry essentially the same workload with 7000 fewer employees than no fewer sick people that demands no less. I think is a tremendous managerial accomplishment, almost miraculous.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:37.730
And I think that the leadership you're providing is certainly very noteworthy. And we certainly need this type of service for New York City. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Dr. John Holliman, President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.
