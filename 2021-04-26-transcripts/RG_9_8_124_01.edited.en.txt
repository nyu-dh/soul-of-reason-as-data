The commissioner of the Human Rights Division of New York City recently stated that the impact of the cutbacks in the city's civil service has adversely affected minority employees. Here, Dr. Herbert White of The New York City Department of Personnel discuss these issues on tonight's "Soul of Reason".

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:38.280
This is "Soul of Reason" a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:01:05.220
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Dr. Herbert White, who is with the New York City Department of Personnel and has a very responsible position dealing with selection of the personnel in New York City. Good to have you with us tonight Herb.

Dr. Herbert White 00:01:18.870
Thank you. Glad to be back with you Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:01:21.880
Well let's just get right into the question that we raised at the beginning of the show. The recent cutbacks in New York City has had an adverse impact on minority employees. What is really the nature of this impact, do you have any statistics on this and also some observations about some of the implications of these cutbacks?

Dr. Herbert White 00:01:44.401
Well Roscoe the statistics I think were rather dramatically put forward by the Commissioner of Human Rights. Eleanor Holmes Norton last week on the front pages of "The Times" in which it is--this means that it is now recognized rather openly that the cutbacks have just about abolished whatever advances might have been made within the last seven or eight years in minority group employment in New York City. With those advances we were not very far, we were still at a very low rate of participation of Blacks and Puerto Ricans and the Police force, Fire force Management, Budget Bureau, Department of Personnel and occupational groups such as Personnel Examiner.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:02:48.661
Well in other words what you're really saying--

Dr. Herbert White 00:02:50.462
--the situation was bad--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:02:52.041
that these cutbacks have affected Blacks and Puerto Ricans mainly in certain departments where they were already sort of last hired and therefore the first to be let go because I believe--and you can correct me on this--is that in certain of the low title positions there's a fairly large number of minority throughout the New York City civil service not just any one particular department. For example the Department of Hospitals which is not civil service but that's a New York City position, Welfare Department and others. What is the--what was before these cutbacks the approximate overall proportion of Blacks and other minorities in New York City's civil service?

Dr. Herbert White 00:03:39.362
I can't give you the exact statistics on that. I can give you the approximation--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:03:50.191
That's what we want.

Dr. Herbert White 00:03:50.196
--about 25 percent of city service consisted of minority group members. This 25 percent as you implied were in the entry level and lower level titles such as clerk, dietary aid, in some cases an entry level title. For example an HDA core community liaison, aid, or community service worker, titles which had been had been created within the last six years or so and primarily under the Lindsey administration to deal with the community. There had been quite a number of Blacks who had come into these titles recently. The layoff has affected those individuals disastrously. We can say that the situation before was bad in the sense that-- in the sense that there was overall insignificant titles a low minority percentage participation. Now the situation is disastrous.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:05:11.830
All right now, given that--

Dr. Herbert White 00:05:12.652
Perhaps I could turn the situation a little bit around and compare that with the police department or the fire department. The police department and the fire department always had low participation by minority group members partly because of the adverse picture of minority groups in the community. The methods of investigation that had been used by previous administrations when it came to minority group members the two value system of investigation, the image of the police department in the black community and a number of other factors the kinds of examinations that were given. A number of these factors had resulted in very very low minority group participation in the police department. And two years ago there was a huge recruitment campaign to attempt to correct the condition, without making any valued judgment on the recruitment campaign. It was to some extent successful: there had been a turn around in the attitude toward the minority group community and for the first time the city was saying quite frankly we want Black policemen and we want Puerto Rican policemen. While there was very little minority group input into decision making on recruitment methods and test construction in this particular campaign we did get--I think-- some small increase in minority group participation in the police department. Those results have been totally abolished with the layoffs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:07:08.751
All right now given that that is a fact and probably the number of people in these various job titles is not going to increase over the next few years, what can be done in this whole area of getting more minorities into civil service? Or are you really saying that we have reached an impasse and at the present time other than upward mobility for those who remain in the system we're not really going to see more minorities coming into New York City's civil service.

Dr. Herbert White 00:07:42.710
We're not going to see more minority group members coming into New York City's civil service unless a very drastic change takes place.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:07:54.480
Just in what way?

Dr. Herbert White 00:07:55.172
First of all, the budgetary crisis presents a--I would not say the rationale--but the budgetary crisis presents the rationale for layoffs. And as we know, the exit of minority group members is very difficult to provide a budgetary rationale for the entrance. We can say that the Equal Employment Opportunity program asks that more minority groups be employed and represented and this is the position of the Black civil service organizations and my own organization, Pier. But this is a argument that is presented on the basis of morality fairness and what should be. This does not have any effect. Yeah well that's true. On the other hand you do have sort of two clashing courses. One is a course that deals with personnel shrinkage because of the budgetary crisis and the other course that the court and other agencies are saying that governmental units and businesses should have affirmative action programs should try to be non-discriminatory, or are the courts going to interpret that as non-discriminatory in the light of whatever jobs are available? According to Eleanor Holmes Norton, most of the court cases which have attacked the seniority principle have failed. And New York City lays people off for wanting to--seniority is the principle buy it holds up.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:09:50.241
In other words seniority--it holds up. All right well let's turn to another area then if the seniority principle is going to hold up. What about the area of promotion because still there will be because of retirements et cetera, some upward mobility and for those Blacks and Hispanics who remain there is still the need to have fair examinations and to see to it that Blacks get moved into higher positions. Is there anything that's being done in an organized way in Department of Personnel to see to it that minorities get a better shot at promotions than they have in the past?

Dr. Herbert White 00:10:31.710
I can say that I do not feel that there is anything that is directly being done throughout the city to promote the interests of minority groups in terms of advancement--not directly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:10:53.161
Well I know--

Dr. Herbert White 00:10:53.702
There are such things as an increased emphasis on research and tests validity which would help to cancel out possibly the difference in test performance. The emphasis on job related tests which are to the advantage of minority group members there is within the Department of Personnel an increased emphasis on training throughout the entire department. I cannot see anything that is happening that will have any differential effect however, generally in increasing the opportunities for minority group members, the system is too vast for that effect to be felt and the general trend now is simply to save jobs.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:11:56.131
All right, speaking of jobs at one time there was a thrust on the part of the Black civil service workers organization to have a Black person appointed to one of the high level positions Director or Assistant Director in the Department of Personnel and I believe that that effort has not borne fruit at present. What is the status of that effort?

Dr. Herbert White 00:12:18.570
Let me precede that by saying that I believe that the only hope that the Blacks and Puerto Ricans have in civil service is to have an effective organization that presses for their needs. In pressing for such needs, Black civil service workers can always have the sense that ultimately they are reflecting not only their own interests but the interests of all civil service workers because the kinds of things that the black civil service workers ask for are increased training opportunities. They ask for this not only for themselves but for all civil service workers because very little training really exists in city departments. The budgetary allowance for that is very small. They ask for improved personnel systems. The general program upon which black civil service workers stands is one really of a first class personnel administration and that will guarantee opportunities and rights to everyone.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:13:36.160
Alright well what specifically has happened--

Dr. Herbert White 00:13:36.166
OK. Now on that basis it was the Federation of Negro Civil Service Organizations and Pier the organization which personnel employees for equal rights of which I am the President at the Department of Personnel pressed to have a personnel director selected who was very very highly qualified as a psychologist and as a personnel person.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:14:20.910
Well what happened in this crusade to get a Black in the highest level of the Department of Personnel?

Dr. Herbert White 00:14:28.110
We enlisted the support of the 100 Black Men, Mark--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:14:37.773
Could you explain to our audience what the 100 Black Men and what Mark are? Because those are organizations not everyone is familiar with.

Dr. Herbert White 00:14:43.680
Well Mark is a action research organization that was headed by Dr. Clarke at the time who was very interested in. Promoting an understanding of how groups could obtain socially desirable objectives. And considering this a socially desirable objective why he worked quite closely with us and giving us a vice, established the connections with the 100 Black Men and a few other organizations in the community. The 100 Black Men is an organization of outstanding Black businessmen, politicians and professional people in the community who have banded together to express and implement aspirations of the Black community. A very strong position was taken in support of the individual that we advanced as a Personnel Director. A committee was set up by the mayor to look and examine the qualifications of the individuals advanced. After three or four months in which we got--I think--some coverage in the Amsterdam News and in the New York Age, the decision came out and the person who is a Deputy Personnel Director was selected. We realized at the time that it was almost an impossible task to try to convince the mayor, the city politicians that the time was ripe for a Black Personnel Director but we felt that it would be worthwhile to make the fight to put all of our energies into this. There was a chance of success which we had one of the most remarkable people in the community advanced what somebody would published about 15 books, was an airforce hero, was a university professor, was recognized by everyone as having the ability for the job. And our expectation was that if we did lose we at least would have made the advance of bringing to the attention that the necessity for the participation in decision making in the city on personnel matters by Blacks and Puerto Ricans. And that there would be some spillover into other areas.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:18:03.640
Well I know that there are some very competent people in the department such as yourself and there are other high level positions I believe you have an important responsibility right now which we'll talk about a little later but what about the Deputy Directorship of Personnel. Is that filled by a minority or is there any potential of that being filled by a minority person?

Dr. Herbert White 00:18:26.530
Well no [laughs], I answer directly no because the situation has been resolved. There was an attempt to convince the mayor and city politicians I suppose or whoever the people are that decide appointments. There was an attempt to convince them that I should be the Deputy Personnel Director. I believe about eight organizations or so supported this. The Federation of Negro Civil Service Organizations first did initiated it at the end branches of the NAACP supported it sending letters to the mayor's office the Association of Black South social workers a number of organizations--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:19:18.100
But didn't work out I gather--

Dr. Herbert White 00:19:18.991
--did not work out right. While I was on vacation. Deputy Personnel Director was appointed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:19:25.601
Well let's talk about your present responsibility and I believe you had a program known as the WREP program and you also have recently received a grant from the Intergovernmental Personnel Act program. Could you tell us exactly what you're doing there and how this relates to improving job opportunities for minorities?

Dr. Herbert White 00:19:44.720
The WREP program has a title that I think none of us like. It's called the Work Relief Employment Program. It however had magnificent potential for helping those minority group members who are on relief. What was done was to create titles in civil service--temporary titles--in civil service which directly parallel the jobs existing in civil service for example, a title in WREP such as office aid, officer Assistant WREP paralleled in the title of clerk in civil service. The intent here was to build up a kind of a system that would reproduce in most aspects a civil service system. The employees were given sick leave, they were given the same pay as civil service employees. It was designed to lift the morale, increase the initiative and the skills of people who participated and then to move them--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:21:03.670
These were people who were on welfare.

Dr. Herbert White 00:21:05.230
These were people who were on welfare. We had eleven thousand at one time.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:21:08.861
What has happened to that program?

Dr. Herbert White 00:21:10.181
That program has declined to approximately fifteen hundred people now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:21:15.852
And why is that?

Dr. Herbert White 00:21:17.411
Because the--I guess--one factor is the budgetary crisis. We can put it that way. The budgetary crisis both state and city has resulted in what ostensibly is a decision that any money put into a program like this is excess cost, costs more than relief and that therefore it is necessary to fall back on the ordinary dole system.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:21:49.450
By ordinary dole system in other words, instead of their working and getting money that pays them more than the basic welfare check now they're not and most of these people are not working and are getting the basic welfare check.

Dr. Herbert White 00:22:00.880
That would be--first they would go onto unemployment insurance and then back onto welfare. Those people who are terminated. I think there's one very important point that should be seen here, and this is that the money that previously was going into welfare checks, that very same money which went into welfare checks was put into a fund. And instead of going into welfare checks, was going into salaries to provide people with a meaningful work experience a research that was done in Housing and Development Administration showed that even among those employees who were suddenly let go last summer that 99 percent of them felt that their experience in the program was profitable and that although they resented the sudden cut off of the program for them--since there had been a sudden decision by the state that 18 months was the maximum and that anyone could remain at it--we had thirteen hundred people laid off. Within I would say two or three weeks that those people who were very resentful because of this kind of a sudden layoff that those very same people in their responses stated that they thought that the program had done them a tremendous amount of good and that they were they wished that they could continue in it and they directly contradicted some of the picture which--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:23:33.311
There are stereotypes about welfare people. Well of course one of the questions comes up is that even with a program like this with the funding eventually, even at the crisis the funding is gonna run out. Was there an intention that these people would be transferred to regular civil service jobs after the WREP program ran out?

Dr. Herbert White 00:23:52.990
Well when the program was originally constructed there was no 18 month limitation--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:24:00.912
But logic alone would dictate it couldn't go on forever [laughs].

Dr. Herbert White 00:24:04.241
Well the point that I'd like to make is that so long as relief funds went on--go on--such a program can go on because it really funds instead of being given out as a Dole can be converted into jobs and that's what happened here. It's the first time it's ever been done and where the jobs are meaningful, well-paying jobs--jobs which have skills.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:24:27.042
On the other hand I believe that the legislation, even if federal legislation did have a cutoff period on it and a question I'm raising as to whether or not this program might not have been a good way to get more Blacks into permanent civil service jobs.

Dr. Herbert White 00:24:41.593
It definitely would have been. It definitely would have been with in normal times, without the tremendous layoffs and civil service that there are now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:24:52.271
All right.

Dr. Herbert White 00:24:52.762
Also a good way to build up skills for going into private industry and these two directions had been established.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:24:59.410
All right well could you tell us about your project under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, which is a very interesting project you working on now.

Dr. Herbert White 00:25:08.023
A population such a WREP--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:25:13.931
Could you tell us what the project is directly?

Dr. Herbert White 00:25:15.822
It is to do test research on the WREP population to attempt to construct valid tests and to eliminate the testing bias.

00:25:27.031
And what are you doing in order to achieve that objective?

Dr. Herbert White 00:25:29.920
What we have--what we're doing is a job analysis of WREP jobs we're giving experimental tests to WREP people and we're we are finding out whether there is any connection between performance on the tests and job performance. In other words are those who perform well on the job also perform well on the test.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:25:55.540
Well given the fact that most of your WREP people have gone, what kind of population do you have to work with?

Dr. Herbert White 00:26:01.040
We have got an extension of the grant to the seat to population.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:26:09.090
And what is seat to population? See among bureaucrats they always use alphabet soup but we know what alphabet soup is so what is the seat to population?

Dr. Herbert White 00:26:17.841
That's something I'm really sorry. Sorry to be guilty because I condemn it in other people. Seat to- is a comprehensive Employment and Training Act. It's the one under which people who are unemployed are put in temporary civil service jobs. The money is provided by the federal government. There was a recent controversy over this as to whether city employees could be could be hired the laid off city employees could be hired on the seat to- and that was resolved by a court case.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:26:53.572
And they are being hired to see if--

Dr. Herbert White 00:26:55.222
They are being hired--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:26:55.961
--which sort of undercuts the basic purpose of seat to- which was to bring in minorities and other people who are unemployed. However it must be said that if laid off city employees are not working they are also unemployed [laughs].

Dr. Herbert White 00:27:07.702
Many of the laid off city employees, I mean I can remember--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:27:10.191
So it does work out although I do know that there was quite a conflict. Well as we come toward the close of our program tonight could you give out in sort of a long range view as you see it as to the future of selection procedures for minorities and civil service.

Dr. Herbert White 00:27:27.501
Well I believe that the only course that will really guarantee any advances for a minority group members now is a very very strong organizational approach.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:27:49.301
You mean a political approach.

Dr. Herbert White 00:27:50.272
Political right, a political and civil service organizational approach to impress upon a structure that makes decisions, that minority group members wish to participate meaningfully in areas where minority group destinies are affected.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior 00:28:16.670
I think with a person like Herb White helping out within the Department of Personnel certainly some of those things might happen. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Dr. Herbert White who's with the New York City Department of Personnel associate personal Examiner and we've been talking about the impact of cuts in New York City's budget on minority civil service workers. Glad to have had you with us as a guest tonight on tonight's "Soul of Reason". Thank you very much Russell.
