Speaker 1 00:00:01.660
On July 1, 1975 the International Women's Year began.

Speaker 2 00:00:06.850
This United Nations sponsored activity has created excitement throughout the world and exploring the accomplishments and developments of women throughout our universe.  Here is Angela King social affairs officer of the United Nations discuss the International Women's Year on tonight Sola.

Speaker 3 00:00:43.490
This is Soul of Reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W and DC community affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.  Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 4 00:01:10.860
With us this evening on soul of reason is MS Angela King who is social affairs officer at the United Nation and is involved in the International Women's Year.  Glad to have you with us tonight.  Angela nice to be here.  BROWN Now let's talk about the purpose of the International Women's Year.  I w y has created excitement all over the world and everybody is talking about it.  And naturally women are particularly excited about it.  So could you tell us what its purpose is and how it came about and then we'll talk about some of the activities later on.

Speaker 5 00:01:43.230
Well the purpose.  The main purpose I think would be to create a lot of interest excitement and new information on the role of women both the present role throughout the world the president contribution and the tremendous potential that we feel has been neglected and that could be used for the development of particularly the developing countries.  It started actually as far back as 72 when the Romanian delegation suggested that this year be held.  And finally in the General Assembly also proved.  And here we are.  As of 1 January 1975 International Women's Year.

Speaker 4 00:02:28.260
Now why did it take a resolution of the United Nations to say let's look at the problems of women throughout the world.  And very specifically why was Romania the country that sort of pushed this.  Was this a Romanian delegate who was a woman.  Was it a response to Ms Angela Brooks being president of the United Nations was a response to the women's liberation movement just how did this happen.

Speaker 5 00:02:53.540
Well I think it happened because of many things.  As you say Ms Mr. your books that was quite a significant factor because you had not had a president of the General Assembly for some time since Madam Pandit in the 50s and this sparked off interest but the Romanians have always had a continuing interest in the affairs of so-called large disadvantaged groups namely youth and women.  And this particular Romanian was is still the vice chairman of the National Police Bureau and she started it off in the Commission on the Status of Women.  I'm sure you knew all about the UN that there are several levels and committees to which these questions have to go.  So once the commission took a decision it then had to go through the council and finally to the General Assembly.

Speaker 4 00:03:49.650
I see now what is your role at the UN.  I see your title as social affairs officer.

Speaker 5 00:03:56.400
What specifically is your role and what do you do in relationship to the International Women's Year where when it's not international and more or less concerned with problems of women in developing countries and this includes both those in Africa Asia Latin America as well as the pockets of poverty in North America in Eastern Europe and so on.  And we are concerned with the main obstacles that keep women from participating fully in development such as why don't they have equal number of jobs with men.  And why don't they get equal education is sort of thing we read reports we do research we contact people all over the world and keep this information in.  We hope to the top planners throughout the world.

Speaker 6 00:04:50.040
Well to what extent has the women's liberation movement in the United States which has been very very publicized due to the efforts of people like Betty for Dan and Gloria Steinem and publications like Ms Magazine and sports figures like Billie Jean King and women like Angela Davis and so on.

Speaker 7 00:05:10.530
To what extent has the women's lib movement in the United States been a catalyst to the International Women's Year or to what extent is it just another one of several things are going on throughout the world.

Speaker 5 00:05:25.470
Well in my view I think anything that happens in the United States is a catalyst for the United Nations but particularly the women's movement and the whole civil rights and human rights movement developing from the 60s sparked off a certain sensitivity within the U.N. and with within the many member countries that has led to years like this.  Of course we must remember that at the same time there have been many new types of socialism or types of lifestyle development styles in countries such as Tanzania and the Caribbean Asia and so on which have all helped.  But I would say that the women's movement has been a very positive factor.

Speaker 4 00:06:08.970
What kind of activities do you plan during the I w y I know I've seen two or three major television programs and I've seen meetings endorsed as official.  I w y activities.  What are some of the things that you plan to do other than just the general consciousness raising that exists because there is a United Nations proclaimed International Women's Year.

Speaker 8 00:06:33.300
Well when you say you are planning to do.  Do you mean the U.N. The you.  Well then we'll ask about OK you know well the U.N. has tried to get countries interested in running their own programs.

Speaker 9 00:06:45.060
So there is a New York Committee.  There is a I believe there is a federal committee which President Ford has been setting up to do certain activities at the U.N. We have tried to get all our regional commissions interested.  They have all had seminars starting from last year on the role of women in integration and with special reference depopulation in fact is trying to link up last year which is where population year with this year and it's a highlight really of this year is going to be the conference in Mexico.  And there are a number of activities there.  First of all there's a conference itself which is going to be talking about the main obstacles and the current trends with women we always have a plan of action which has rethink some very concrete positive programs that countries will tell us where when is this conference in Mexico and where Mexico is going to be.  It's going to be in Mexico City and went from 19 to June to the 2nd of July.  I see June 19th and 2nd of July.

Speaker 8 00:07:51.810
Can anyone attend or is it by invitation.  Well almost anyone can attend because it is arranged in such a way that when the large conference it's the first Intergovernmental Conference of this type we'll have all states not just members of the U.N. attending and all liberation movements that have been recognized there will be a tribune of non-governmental organizations which almost anybody can attend.

Speaker 9 00:08:17.400
Seminar in development and various other activities.

Speaker 6 00:08:22.160
Now if someone in the audience wanted to contact you or someone at the United Nations how would they get in touch with the people responsible for setting up this conference.

Speaker 9 00:08:32.940.0000000000582
Well they could call me only they could call.  I think they could call me at extension for an end to two.

Speaker 4 00:08:40.289.9999999999418
All right let's get the numbers.

Speaker 6 00:08:41.820.0000000000582
Angela King at the United Nations and the phone number is Plaza 4 1 2 3 4 and your extension is 4 9 2 2 1 9 2 2.  So if anyone is really interested in participating in this exciting conference in Mexico they can contact.  Angela King at Plaza for 1 2 3 4 ext 4 9 2 2.

Speaker 9 00:09:05.190
And it is is that right.  Yes I was just going to add that if anyone is a member of one of the non-governmental organizations that are in Consultative Status with the U.N. they can go of course through their organization.

Speaker 4 00:09:18.180
What are some of these nongovernmental organizations do you name a couple.

Speaker 9 00:09:21.420
Well there's the International Center for the rights of man the Society for professional women lawyers.  There are a number of other Amnesty International and so on.

Speaker 4 00:09:36.210
You said that you you and some of the other women and planners of the conference and I imagine there must be some men involved in this as well because I think many of us who are men recognize the need for improved rights for women have some major programs to propose what are some of these things you would like to propose.

Speaker 9 00:09:57.990
Well for example a plan of action itself is split up into various sections for instance on education and literacy.  We are proposing that there be task forces of women and men many young people in various countries to try and eradicate literacy within and eradicate literacy literacy so many times after what you might know to do that.  Because of course the majority of the women of the words illiterate are women.  And that is interesting.  Forty four percent of all women are illiterate and it's only 30 percent of men.  Of course you want to eradicate it among both women and men.

Speaker 4 00:10:44.630
That's that's a number one point I can see and the reason for this is a cultural reason.  Is it because women are literally denied the opportunity to gain literacy or they don't think it's important.

Speaker 9 00:10:57.190
It's a combination I think no it would be difficult to find any particular country where you had women who didn't think it was important.  But it's a question of reality or of being able to get access to schools in many countries are not enough schools in many countries because of cultural barriers.  Parents still don't send their daughters to school.  They prefer to send their sons because they're going to you know make good and the woman is supposed to get married and so on.  So there are a number of reasons many financial.

Speaker 4 00:11:31.560
And that's one very major goal that you have in mind.

Speaker 9 00:11:35.650
What's another now in the area of population for example.  We are hoping that governments will try and give as much information as possible to everyone but mainly to women about birth control and not so much birth control but family planning which is.  The ability to number and space your children as it suits you so that you can continue your education if you want.  You can continue working if you want.  Because we find that a number of women who do work have to leave the workforce to look after children or have to lose seniority and give up opportunities because of having to stay home looking for looking after children.  We also find that it's linked up with the heads of women that if they go on having you know more and more children it's neither good for them says nor the children.

Speaker 4 00:12:34.000
So you're going to work on literacy and population child bearing family planning.

Speaker 9 00:12:39.280
What are some other things political in the area of political rights.  Are you saying that women are extremely active in many countries for instance in Guinea 27 percent of the national national legislature are composed of women and as you know the House of Representatives in this country twenty two point nine.  But we feel that women still put forward main candidates still prefer to work for men candidates and that if they're really to participate in development it means being able to make the decisions at the very top level.  And this means getting into politics at all levels.  So we need a massive campaign for political information and education to me.

Speaker 6 00:13:21.280
Now why is it you think that women throughout the world have not been that active politically.  Is it because of putdown of Manaus because they haven't thought it important or because they thought meant to do it better.  Oh sorry.

Speaker 10 00:13:33.910
But I think that in some countries for example in one country in Kenya there was an extremely active woman and she had always had the main candidates and then she suddenly decided she was going to run herself and she was more or less removed from her party.  She had to run on her own and she lost.  And then again it's a question of money campaigns even in the remotest village nowadays we run television.

Speaker 11 00:14:04.150
The world is out there.

Speaker 9 00:14:06.040
You don't only need money for television you know.

Speaker 12 00:14:09.930
But and of course some women in many countries the large families can't get away to travel long distances.

Speaker 4 00:14:16.450
So it's a question of convenience and how would you propose to change that.  Because a couple of things are things that are not easily changed.  You feel that if there is a consciousness a consciousness among women.

Speaker 12 00:14:31.030
We hope to throughout the year there be exhibitions of famous women who have done well in all fields.  And we feel that you know if other women see what women can do in other countries and how they can overcome difficulties.  Then get onto this and through out through women's groups.  I think the non-governmental women's groups are very very important as pressure groups both for themselves and for governments.

Speaker 7 00:15:00.430
Now is that literacy population political rights.

Speaker 12 00:15:03.370
What else goes into the mass media.  Is it something you know a lot about.  But we feel that.  The basic maybe the most important obstacle is attitudes and it's not just attitudes of governments or employers but we feel that the mass media themselves have to develop a kind of built in critique for observing their own programs and trying to see what is really prejudicial to women and so on.  And this has to be something that starts really from early childhood schoolbooks at mother's knee and must also be directed to women themselves because we ourselves feel that we are not capable and not up to certain things.

Speaker 4 00:15:49.350
In other words a lot of what you're emphasizing is consciousness raising helping women to recognize their own potential.  At the same time to take steps to deal with some of the things yes are pressing them such things as equal pay for equal work.  Right.  Yes.  A program of.

Speaker 12 00:16:08.570
Yes what I was here it is and this is something that I was coming to.  In a way it is tied up with international instruments or international laws and conventions.  There are a number of them which exist and we hope to draw attention to the fact that some countries have not yet signed some of these conventions that those who happened will do so.

Speaker 10 00:16:30.120
And down the elimination of discrimination against women in employment is one and equal pay for equal work.

Speaker 6 00:16:37.200
But given the situation throughout the world where they literally are not enough jobs.  Are you fomenting this type of political unrest where you're suggesting that women get in and compete with men in societies where there already are not enough jobs for men.

Speaker 12 00:16:51.360
No we are not really suggesting that although we think that it is this it's been overplayed.

Speaker 10 00:16:58.320
This business of women you know turfing men out of their jobs for instance in India one economist has pointed out that in engineering women are kept out of engineering.  Yet engineers male engineers are still out of work so it doesn't necessarily mean that see jobs even male.

Speaker 8 00:17:20.99.99999999988358
So you had females competing to be but it wasn't true.

Speaker 10 00:17:24.89.99999999988358
We are hoping that there will be alternative economic rules.  In other words we're not just talking about wage employment or getting women in industry and so on but getting women really informed about how to run credit unions how to run cooperatives how to this maybe with food we know there is a terrific food shortage.  Food processing.  We want to inform women or to get women to inform themselves about credit facilities.  We want to take out all that type of discrimination.  And at the same time we want to impress on governments that is it's ridiculous to have cooperatives running in a remote village or in some point and there is no transportation or no marketing.  So we want to get women involved in all that sort of thing.

Speaker 6 00:18:10.860
Now the question that comes up quite frequently when we deal with the women's movement and the like is that black women are not particularly concerned with at least in the United States what's called women's liberation that black women have always had some of these rights and they've always been leaders of their families and the women's move for women's rights is more of a white woman's thing rather than a black woman's thing and that's related to the United States to a certain extent to what extent do you believe this is true in the United States based on your experience and to what extent you believe is true throughout the world.  Do you think that black women are more or less concerned about the press for equal rights because they may feel that they already have it or don't need it.

Speaker 10 00:19:03.180
That's a difficult question.  I'm not saying this because I'm trying to get out of it but because it really liberation equality and development means so many different things depending on the level of development and a sort of awareness of people in a particular country.  My finding in this country particularly has been that many black women feel that women's liberation and the liberation movements.  Really don't concern them at all.  It's just another.  Suburban middle class thing fad and I don't think this is true.  But to a certain extent it has been focused in some countries I think meaning that the industrial highly industrialized countries on facets of women's activities or roads that are not really relevant maybe to the situation of the black woman who is struggling to lift herself up lift up her family and for instance and I don't.  And this is something that appears in one of our reports that a woman who is fighting for an executive type job in a bank or in a big corporation in this country is not you can't expect she the white highly educated woman who may be fighting for that to be fighting for the same thing as a black woman who may be a domestic or something like that.  But I do think that the year is not just on what a woman can do but what they are doing.  And I think the contribution of the black woman and the black mother in this country and in many other countries is extremely relevant.

Speaker 6 00:20:51.020
Not only she wrote for her to recognize it as she really does but for many other people too well what are some of the things that you're doing to highlight the accomplishments of women both black white yellow brown red throughout the world.  What are some of the things that you're doing with other people who are involved in this.  Well for one thing our delegations to the conference will be a mean.

Speaker 10 00:21:15.320
Leader to assistance and then any number of advisors and we're getting a number of world leaders wives of prime ministers very active women throughout the world to be at this conference in addition to that there will be a journalist encounter in Mexico.  And we are having some quite important people coming to that.  We had one earlier on 7th of March where Germaine Greer is there.  Betty Friedan Ambassador sissy of Guinea.  Mr. Bata by from Iran as well as Alvin Toffler.  And Mr. microbial of the intermediate Institute of Technology in London and various people like that.

Speaker 4 00:22:03.680
So we are getting together personalities as well as you know talking about minorities and talking about outstanding women you mentioned prime ministers wives.

Speaker 8 00:22:12.270
There is a woman outstanding merely because she marries a prime minister or is it because of some things she does in her role as young because I think that a prime minister's wife if she is truly interested she can do a lot because of her high visibility.

Speaker 10 00:22:28.670
And I think there are few like this Mrs. Marcos Mrs. Manley from Jamaica and a few others who Mrs Whitlam in Australia who because of what they see and because they are constantly going around drawing things to the attention of people in the news get us let's face it.  And this is what we want.

Speaker 6 00:22:49.640
But not all of them that I see now as the year moves toward a close if we only about the middle of it but toward the end of the year I would assume that the organising committee et cetera want to set up some type of long range program covering some of the points that you previously mentioned.  Do you feel that the momentum that has been started by the National Women's Year will continue.  And if so what is saying some of the things that will make it continue and will happen as a result of its continuance.

Speaker 10 00:23:29.630
Well the plan of action that I was mentioning earlier about population and employment and so on we are hoping that the conference will start a decade that 1975 will really mark the beginning of a decade for women.

Speaker 13 00:23:46.310
And if this is really to be successful we'd have to have some evaluating machinery to follow up and an already a number of countries have planned seminars up seminars and the one in Argentina in October and women in development one in mass media in Australia in December.  And Cuba has offered to have a Latin American conference next year as a follow up both to see what has been done and what sort of machinery is needed.

Speaker 7 00:24:23.780
Now what about in the United States with the Equal Rights Amendment VRA is the United States the first nation to propose an Equal Rights Amendment for women.  Is there something on the agenda for other nations or if something is necessary.

Speaker 13 00:24:39.800
I think it is very necessary.  I wouldn't say they are the first to have an equal rights amendment but other nations for instance Britain has a series of laws that together would probably come to an Equal Rights Amendment.  You know they may have a law for employment or pensions or something like that France has to.

Speaker 4 00:25:04.020
I mean for example there are no credit sanctions against women in England.  Oh yes there are.

Speaker 7 00:25:08.750
Well the Equal Rights Amendment in United States would prevent that.  Yes.  So that that would really go beyond just an individual lawsuit one of the encompassing things behind the VRA which part one reason why some people are opposing it is that it literally wouldn't eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and such things that discrimination and credit and lending and the like would be prohibited along with many many other things whereas when it's attempted to be done law by law such as a giving of suffrage to women back and twenty it goes through a hard fight each time so it would appear that one of the things that this conference would be seeking would be equal rights legislation throughout the world.  Definitely.  And that would include suffrage and access to jobs and the like.  But given the fact that in many of these countries the suffrage itself is not guaranteed everyone you have a problem.  I'm not familiar with this but I believe I've heard that in some countries even today women are not given the right to vote.

Speaker 13 00:26:19.630
About seven or eight where women are not do not have the right to vote.

Speaker 7 00:26:26.180
Now I would be certainly a high priority in terms of follow up action for the next decade or so yes.

Speaker 9 00:26:32.800
And I think that the the U.S. Equal Rights Amendment is extremely far reaching.  However what we have found in say 20 odd years when the commission has been aware is that although the laws are passed not implemented and this is what our great concern is that's true of course you have really two things you're working toward.

Speaker 7 00:26:55.840
One is a raising of the consciousness of women themselves and men as well as this goes along.  And also the development of specific programs of action which would translate this increased consciousness into things that sort of assure the first class citizenship of women throughout the world.  To summarize as we come to a close of our program to what extent do you think the International Women's Year will be successful in achieving its goals.

Speaker 9 00:27:26.290
I think it will be successful because I think it is the first time that so many people and at such a level that is and I'm not talking now just about prime ministers and so on but planners women at grassroots level cooperative leaders and so on have really been touched and know that something is happening that concerns all of them.  I Oh throw it away.  I think it will be successful.

Speaker 4 00:27:49.210
I certainly hope so and I.  Anyone in the audience who wishes to follow up on International Women's Year can contact Miss Angela King at Plaza 4 1 2 3 4 ext 4 9 2 2.  I'd like to thank our guests Angela King social affairs officer of the United Nations for discussing with us the International Women's Year.  Thank you Angela.  Thanks a lot for asking.
