Speaker 1 00:00:01.830
One of today's major social problems is child care and child placement is residential treatment or foster home care more effective. Is there racism in the area of judicial placement. Here the answers to these questions from Lewis White of Wilbanks school. On today's soul of reason. This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the Black Thought.

Speaker 2 00:00:46.210
Soul of reason is produced by the W1 B.C. public affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:07.090
Our guest on today's soul of reason is Lewis White associate director of the Wiltshire school. Glad to have you visit with us today Lou. Thank you. Glad to be here.

Speaker 4 00:01:16.150
Now as we have been talking this whole area of child care and child placement is really a toughie in today's society in particular for black youth and for minority youth. And I thought it might be interesting to begin with.

Speaker 5 00:01:29.700
Well with schools role in this whole area of child care and child placement it perhaps is better to explain it from a historical point. That's good. That's a very good idea. Well it was founded originally in 1937 through the efforts of.

Speaker 6 00:01:46.990
The late Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and in conjunction with efforts made by family court judges in New York City. At that time it became apparent that black children in New York City had no option in case of placement except to go to a state training school or to a correctional institution treatment for emotional disturbance was literally out of the question.

Speaker 7 00:02:10.710.0000000000146
Well was founded for the sole purpose of giving an option for treatment for black children in New York City because of racism that existed at that time and the school was founded essentially for black children.

Speaker 8 00:02:22.270
It was now just as an aside is the enrollment limited to black children at this time.

Speaker 7 00:02:29.620
Well as things have evolved the charter has been amended to accept children of all races and background. It now has a composition of 75 percent black children 15 percent Puerto Rican 10 percent white. To further answer your first question what has evolved as primarily a institution for black emotionally disturbed children. It has taken upon itself to update the growing gap of services that are available for black and Puerto Rican children as opposed to white children. While there has been a legal mandate for racism to stop and his sister and its parents.

Speaker 6 00:03:15.130
The reality is that it still exists now in the school what actually happens with the youngsters in the school and I should define the school in terms of the institution at Yorktown Heights that is now only one aspect in terms of what happens. We have a intensified program for remediation and an educational level psychotherapy by caseworkers psychologists and psychiatric consultation.

Speaker 7 00:03:42.250
We have a live in situation a classroom situation with a teacher ratio of 60 to children where recreational programs in Drama Arts and Crafts a multiplicity of services to make a positive interruption to a child who has been functioning in a dysfunctional way in the community.

Speaker 9 00:04:04.180
Now the age range of the youngsters there is about how long. How wide.

Speaker 7 00:04:08.860
Well until recently their age range has been from 7 I have to 10.

Speaker 8 00:04:13.450
Have we now have an adolescent unit now that has boys up to 15 up to 15 and about how many boys do you have in the school. A hundred thirty two thirty two most of them come as a result of families requesting aid or do most of them come as a result of court placement.

Speaker 6 00:04:29.980
Usually as a result of family requesting aid and that's known as a Pens petition PR and as a person in need of supervision which is an outgrowth of the old incorrigible child act in New York City.

Speaker 9 00:04:43.150
In other words if a parent really felt that the youngster in their family was not developing in a way that would enable him to function fairly effectively in the family group he could then go to a social agency and ask for him to go to a school like Will.

Speaker 7 00:05:00.790
That's correct. Through that department Social Services Bureau child welfare and I hasten to add that wold work in its role today has has said that the institution has in its traditional form is rather irrelevant because the shipping of a child 40 45 miles away from home to a country a state type environment does not have relevance unless they are attached to the community and liaisons so all sorts to where the child comes from.

Speaker 3 00:05:33.520
If indeed he is to return to the community how do you deal with that.

Speaker 10 00:05:37.360
We deal with that by the most progressive example of that is in Brooklyn where we have what we refer to as our Brooklyn project.

Speaker 11 00:05:47.330
Children who are discharged from what we have available to them a number of services to reinforce and sustain the gains that they hopefully have made while they were on the campus of the will of the Brooklyn project has for example a day center for recreation after school. It has tutorial program a homemaker service for trained homemakers to reinforce the strengths of a family where the mother feels overwhelmed where the mother does not know how to cope with many of the economic and social pressures within the home. The theory being that it can sustain the gains that are made for the child who has been in the institution and it can be preventive for the child who may have to go to an institution which isn't always necessary.

Speaker 3 00:06:37.070
In other words some of the youngsters who have been wont work when they go back to Brooklyn they can avail themselves of this as Santa.

Speaker 5 00:06:46.250
That's correct.

Speaker 10 00:06:46.830
What do you call a uh oh yeah we have a day center and we have a center we call the day center and from there many programs emanate including tutorial programs homemaker organizer which is not part of a center but it's part of the Brooklyn project.

Speaker 8 00:07:04.160
How many of you youngsters actually go right back and not write back. Go into the school situation in public schools with private schools that they were attending after they've been at work week or do you generally keep most of them in a special school type situation.

Speaker 7 00:07:20.870
Well most of them go back to the public school situation. However if a child does present special problems we have a component of that book and project for example of that is an educational piece which gives it a 10 week intensive care program and mediation so that the child can read and reenter with some new games.

Speaker 11 00:07:44.690
I wish of course is to establish a private school for children who are disadvantaged such as these children. Many of these children cannot cope with the public school system.

Speaker 4 00:07:54.140
Why is that.

Speaker 10 00:07:55.970
Because the long years of deprivation and the fact that most of the homes tend to be broken there there's not reinforcement of academic subjects to the level that one would hope there is. The schools themselves are lacking in special kinds of problems that the children have. If a child has learning difficulties this may be associated with certain kinds of neurological problems or what's commonly referred to as minimal brain dysfunction and other variations of learning problems. While that takes highly specialized people and special education to get a child's ability I enhanced enough for example to read and do mathematics and arithmetic and the work week school would like to sort of be a catalyst for developing a private fully funded school for youngsters have these kind of problems.

Speaker 8 00:08:54.110
And speaking of funding how is the world with school funded.

Speaker 10 00:08:58.130
Well most of the funding is through the Bureau of Child Welfare. We have a reimbursement formula that we receive so much money from New York City who borrow child welfare on a per diem basis for each child. We also do private fundraising at a level of over 400 thousand last year. I might say that one of our biggest events is coming up. The Bolshoi Ballet in June which is our largest single benefit of the year.

Speaker 8 00:09:27.590
Now speaking of your role basically your role is residential treatment but there's also some advocates of what's called foster home care and I was just wondering what is your opinion and maybe what are some statistics on the relative effectiveness of these two types of child care.

Speaker 7 00:09:52.250
I'm glad you're asking for you asking for bias because I have one and my bias is that that foster care has traditionally done many fine things and still has merit under the best conditions. The bias we have a world quake is that for children who need permanent home living situations where they do not have alternate homes to look forward to. We would rather air on the side of placing a child in a group home. We have established three group homes in the community and has a group home a group home is a permanent living situation and now in a sense uh it's usually two apartments that are joining has eight to 10 boys with supervision of social workers psychiatrists counselors cooks and all other kinds of support it's a permanent living situation for boy.

Speaker 8 00:10:40.790
Now the. The uh poem. Let's say it's a ten year old boy. It needs to be some full time adult supervision. I would assume around the clock. And is there one person who lives there like a house father or a house mother. Or do you have a staff that sort of rotates in and out not rotate but comes and stays for a period of time another staff comes and stays for a period of time.

Speaker 10 00:11:05.270
Well what we hope for Roscoe is to have just what you describe what we find empirically is that it's very difficult to get to a middle aged people who can cope with 10 adolescent boys.

Speaker 3 00:11:17.040
Yeah I got this. It's very difficult to get to any help with that because it's quite quite a thing.

Speaker 5 00:11:23.750
It's quite an urban community of course the problems are just multiply and multiply fantastic resistance to placement of these group homes. That's very very true. What success have you had. How many group homes have you been able to establish. Well today we have three that we have established in last two years and the next year we hope to establish an additional five.

Speaker 4 00:11:44.420
I see and they are running are they running all in Manhattan or someone is one.

Speaker 10 00:11:49.210
What is Manhattan and 2 in the Bronx and 2 in Iraq.

Speaker 4 00:11:53.330
I see. So your bias really tends to run in terms of a more permanent type family type situation and what you really have a sort of a middle ground between a residential treatment center and a foster home which would be yes with parents now there as you say under the best conditions some foster homes and foster parents have gone very well. But I gather you see some other problems in that. And I guess one of the problems is the fact that sometimes youngsters are moved around a number of times. Exactly. That is a problem now. This brings up the whole question that we've heard a lot about about the adoption and permanent placement of black children. Is the situation getting better or if it isn't getting better. What can be done to improve the situation in regard to getting permanent homes for black youngsters who don't have parents.

Speaker 7 00:12:49.340
It's a very difficult situation and the it's a futile exercise in many ways to attempt to get a an appropriate number of foster homes or adopt adoptive homes for black children. Now why is that. I know the first answer is I don't know.

Speaker 5 00:13:08.500
Yeah I guess if we knew we'd be able to do something about it but what are some of your conjectures on that. Usually I use it as feudal and that was what I was very interested in.

Speaker 7 00:13:17.750
Well let's take for example and the white population there. There is a scarcity of adoptive homes there people. There's a there's a black market system and the white population for adopting babies in ways that no one can get enough of them. And that has a lot to do with a scarcity of children in some families. The sheer volume of people of white families and white couples who want children and cannot have children as opposed to many black families who have many children of their own and cannot really put themselves in a position to take additional children in I would dare say that many white families who adopt children for whatever reason do not want to give natural birth to children many of them do I'm sure. But if we look at the economic condition of black people who who whether they wanted to or not.

Speaker 10 00:14:23.140
In many instances the family size proliferated. Until the last two or three years or information of birth control and things of that sort has as never really meant a high black children population. So the need and the want for additional children into that system is less I see.

Speaker 9 00:14:44.380
So what do you see as some solutions to this.

Speaker 4 00:14:48.730
Because there are considerably larger number of black children and more recently Puerto Rican children who require placement. So it's a question of staying in a residential treatment center or going through a revolving door of a number of different foster homes. Is it. Merely an economic thing or is it an add to no thing. Or what about that.

Speaker 7 00:15:17.550
I must frankly say that I think with regard to placement of black and Puerto Rican children the system itself is rigged to their disadvantage. There are some pretty hard statistics about this. And I if I were to quote some I would give us my authority the study back to family court judges. Judge Roach and the honorable Justin White Boy who published a research finding last year entitled juvenile justice confounded pretensions and realities.

Speaker 12 00:15:51.580
What are some of the things they had to say about this and what they said in effect was that the system although there is a legal mandate to be it to be otherwise is still racist against the black and Puerto Rican child.

Speaker 7 00:16:05.020
If a black child for example gets into difficulty and if there's obvious emotional disturbance then we can make assumptions about emotional disturbance her child chronically gets into difficulty. If we can do that then we would say well why is it that 73 percent of black and Puerto Rican children are sent to state training schools who indeed work very hard and do a creditable job with the budget that they have on the other hand. The reality is that they are not equipped nor do they have the money the budget or the staff or the training to help children in a rehabilitative way. Now there is a private voluntary sector in New York City which is controlled and we are a member of that private voluntary sector. But at least to the extent that we are we are we have deficits and we recognize it and we would like to change that. We've made steps in that direction. But I go on to say that the probably voluntary agencies end up not accepting black and Puerto Rican children at the same rate that they do. White children. Seventy three percent of black Puerto Rican children who get into difficulty or show emotional disturbance go to state training schools. Seventy eight percent of white children who get into difficulty or show emotional disturbance go to private residential treatment centers.

Speaker 8 00:17:22.930.0000000001164
Now what do you know. Obviously there is a racial difference which suggests no racism in this Royce form. Well what are some of the subtle things that you think bring this about. Because it's it's so blatantly different.

Speaker 13 00:17:36.710
It must be some really subtle things that are happening there.

Speaker 8 00:17:39.750
Is it the numbers of white children who are in trouble is it the fact that they may have better legal representation and in fact they may have better parental involvement the fact that they may be religiously affiliated and the organizations that they go to religiously affiliated. What is what are some of the more subtle things that bring this about.

Speaker 14 00:17:57.950
That's a very good question Roscoe. I would speculate around it and say that.

Speaker 10 00:18:04.370
There is a preference and many institutions to maintain what they traditionally had the trouble with most bureaucracies is that a great deal of energy is devoted to their own survival. And I would say for example that all of the residential treatment centers that would be preferable for most of these children who go to state run schools. Most of these visits with treatment centers we're all white at one point. That's why Welbeck was founded. I think it has implications in terms of the the administration of private agencies. The overwhelming number of executives and child care agencies that serve black or white children almost invariably white. So extends that far also. And one could reason that well if I get 80 90 percent of black kids in my institution before long the community will be asking for black executive director. There are very few black directors New York City and child and child services and children's services.

Speaker 14 00:19:07.680
There are many other reasons.

Speaker 7 00:19:10.030
There is I think the emotional unconscious autonomous kind of resistance to the black Puerto Rican population as there is the most subtle prejudicial way. There are all kinds of rationalizations for this. I once sat on a admissions committee at another children's institution where. There was a an open commitment to not to take more than 50 percent black children. And what that meant was that in this open setting a the most severely disturbed black white child was admitted and was admitted and inappropriately. So because that child could not cope with that open setting the black child was left outside or sent to State Training School or sent to one of the many city shelters which is really disgraceful.

Speaker 5 00:20:05.080
And as you say this was an open agreement that yeah socialization. Right. That's right. There was an accusation that if you have a.

Speaker 15 00:20:16.330
Black children be on a certain level this would kill what is typical in the population of an integrated society and the commitment for integrated society. Therefore if you have an institution that is not fully integrated with a sufficient number of whites then the black child wouldn't be able to adjust that well when they got out and God knows these black children go back to the black ghetto.

Speaker 5 00:20:41.630
But that was a rationalization. I think there were other subtle reasons.

Speaker 13 00:20:45.290
Now has that been changed because it would appear that a less qualified people are being more qualified in terms of the nature of their condition of being accepted and more qualified people in terms of the nature of their condition and potential what they are benefiting from it are being rejected that there would be a basis of suit legal action and invasive unfair treatment. Has that been contemplated. Have any of those things ever come up.

Speaker 6 00:21:11.680
I don't know if it's been contemplated but I do know that there have been verbal confrontations I know of no legal action that's been taken with regard to that and I think would be difficult in terms of intention if the intention is from if the rationale is expressed for a treatment point of view then you get into a rather philosophical treatment argument if the unspoken intention is to discriminate on a racial and ethnic basis then that's not spoken I don't how you can get to it.

Speaker 13 00:21:40.990
Now in these assignments because you say they are court placements. Seventy eight percent go one place to the treatment to state institutions and 78 percent of the whites go to the residential treatment units. This would suggest that the judge is making a decision now he makes his decision on the basis of write ups and recommendations is part of the decision making process. The fact that the institution has to agree to take the child.

Speaker 7 00:22:08.830
That's another very good point the institution traditionally has the option of taking the child or not taking the child and even if the judge assign the child the institution does have that option.

Speaker 16 00:22:20.920
Most of these institutions don't take court remand. The state has to take them the private voluntary sector does not have to. And that's part of the discrimination that I think we should talk about which is I might say is broader than than race or ethnic it's discrimination against age discrimination against adolescents. It's discrimination against drug users it's discrimination against the hard to treat child.

Speaker 7 00:22:43.420
And I repeat again the comfort that some people administrators give themselves is a luxury to make things easy for themselves.

Speaker 9 00:22:55.990
It's really at the core of this problem also of course the voluntary agencies might argue that we raise the money and we decide which people we're going to deal with. Why should we be forced to take people that we don't think we can be effective with the same outside of the question of race.

Speaker 12 00:23:11.260
Well that's an irrational point that is given again through the tradition of of what a private agency has private means that you should have option. But the fact of the matter is that won't work. Children's Village Hawthorne you knows most of these pleasant well most of these institutions have reimbursement from New York City and I would dare say that they raise no more than 20 15 20 percent of the money and most of the money is public.

Speaker 3 00:23:37.810
So in fact the state would have the option if it really wanted to exercise it that if you're going to take our money you take anybody we send to you.

Speaker 16 00:23:46.630
Well there's something going on now about that proposed contract with voluntary agencies and and many people are upset about it. I'm very glad to see it come. Just explain briefly the bureau child welfare and its contract to the board of directors of private agencies. Now I want to say that give us your intake quite criteria and we will guarantee a certain amount of payment over the year for a certain number of beds whether you have the children or not.

Speaker 3 00:24:11.060
The quid pro quo for that will be you take anybody every cent you take you take anybody that we send that meet your intake criteria right. Well that would seem to be very light. Now you say this is in advance to negotiate now. What do you mean by contract. You mean this is part of a contract between the voluntary agency in the state or between the workers in the organization and the organization.

Speaker 16 00:24:32.870
It's between the New York City bureau of child welfare and the private agencies and has either been implemented or is that still in the process of discussion.

Speaker 7 00:24:41.720
It will be implemented imminently.

Speaker 3 00:24:46.120
I'm sure you know there was no legal action is required to implement this. Yes it can be done through administrative action.

Speaker 16 00:24:52.850
It can be done. Well the board of directors of these agencies have to approve this in order to get reimbursement. But if they don't they don't get the money. They could wipe out the condition that would guarantee a certain number of beds for payment.

Speaker 3 00:25:04.790
Right. And of course that would put it right to the issue. Do you want to survive as you have been or do you want to survive in a way that meets the needs of society better. Exactly. And the thing that confounds us so much is the question of race because if it were a question of all white youngsters. Well even then I guess they engage you say the other forms of discrimination. Some institutions will only take people of a certain age of a certain religion of a certain drug use a non drug user type situation. So what you're really suggesting is that the public itself needs to re-evaluate its criteria for providing service. What kind of services does it want to be provided. What type of options do they want to make available. So the voluntary agencies basically have been beyond the purview of governmental control because purportedly they're voluntary but as you point out very rightfully only a relatively small proportion of their budget is raised in the voluntary sector. That's exactly right. Now of course this will lead some people say well gee if you eliminate voluntary agencies then you require them to take so many people then you eliminate the very options and creativity the volunteer agencies is supposed to stimulate.

Speaker 8 00:26:25.160
So how do you deal with that particular one.

Speaker 15 00:26:27.470
I think there has to be a broad confrontation to the effect that private voluntary agencies with all of the good things that they have done or that we have done we are part of that. I was about to say we nevertheless have not met the most crucial problems and we have to at least get on the table that if a child is experimenting with drugs that's not a reason to reject him that one for example that one criterion is is something that is used across the board almost. But yet on top of that the complexity of race gets on it. For example 14 percent of black children are accepted who have a history of drug experimentation 67 percent of white children who have a history of drug experimentation I accept it.

Speaker 9 00:27:14.720
Well of course that raises the issue that we've been talking about on the program. Well as we come to close of today's program I was just wondering what do you think the future is. Do you think things are going to get better in terms of child placement.

Speaker 15 00:27:27.410
I think things will get much better in terms of child placement. I think the much of the authority that's exercised by a private voluntary sector is an assumed authority and it's not a real authority when it's challenged and confronted. I think that they have to yield for their own survival.

Speaker 9 00:27:42.000
Okay. Gee I'd like to thank you Lou. Our guest on today was they soul of reason has been Lewis White Associate Director workweek school and we've been discussing their various problems in child care and child placement particularly with reference to the black child.
