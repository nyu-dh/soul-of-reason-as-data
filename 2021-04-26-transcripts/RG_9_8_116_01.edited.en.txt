The Black family has often been maligned by academicians. They are often viewed as a cause of their condition rather than the victim. Dr. Herbert Gutman has prepared a very comprehensive study on the black family in the United States. Hear him discuss his new book, "The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750 to 1925" on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:42.091
This is "Soul of Reason." A program that will examine the roots of the Black thoughts, Soul of Reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:01:08.640
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Dr. Herbert Gutman, a distinguished professor and author of the new book, "The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom," and her of this book has gotten really fine critical reception. It presents a bleak view of the black family that hasn't been openly presented or widely presented before, and I thought we might begin our discussion tonight by asking you exactly how you became interested in studying the Black family.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:01:35.910
Well Roscoe, it really began at the time of the controversy in the mid 60s that was sparked by them what's called them won a hand report that is to say the argument that Moynihan put forth suggesting that the--some of the difficulty, he never said how much--but some of what he called a tangle of pathology, what he called a tangle of pathology actually, among poor urban Blacks in the 1960s had its roots in a long history of family disorganization. If you remember the language in the report, he was arguing for employment, but he surrounded it with a kind of vision and version of the Afro-American experience which emphasized that the core of the experience was one of broken families, of disorganized families, of matriarchy, rooting it of course in the slave experience and making the argument that norms which were--to use a fancy sociological word--dysfunctional to everyday life had their origin and slaves couldn't do anything about it, had their origin in the slavery period and were reinforced by racism and rural poverty and accompanied Blacks into the city in the Great 20th Century Migrations. And the suggestion of course was that some of the value system--that that was a whole steady process of continual disorganization feeding upon itself that independent, at one point he says in the report, of what whites were in fact doing to Blacks.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:03:18.420
And of course in the Black community this particular analysis was really seemed--deemed--as an insult.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:03:24.571
That's right. Well--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:03:25.381
Those of us in the Black community who have been keenly aware of the traditions of freedom and uplift and humanity, felt that an analysis which suggested that we in fact were the cause of what was happening to us rather than the victim of the economic conditions and the racism in this society, let us as academicians--Black academicians--to reject it, and I personally feel that it's really a beautiful window on the world, in terms of having some sunlight thrown on this, to have a book such as yours that presents some information and analysis that goes beyond this cultural analysis that says, "Yes we-"

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:04:08.040
The cultural poverty kind of construct, which of course is the further we get away from it, the more ridiculous it becomes. What it does is confuse a consequence with a cause and make it into a cause, and it's applied particularly mainly to Black people but it's also applied to white people and white poor people. I think what was interesting, Roscoe, is that the Black response, on one hand, report and the critical whites. What was interesting is--I mean the report was dealt with on its own terms very decisively at the time it was written. I mean, it wasn't accepted as fact; there was great controversy over that.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:04:46.710
It still really has not been accepted as fact. The problem is that Moynihan was in a position to influence governmental policy--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:04:53.611
That's right.

00:04:54.032
--and certain governmental programs, namely the cultural deprivation programs, the programs to bridge the gaps of cultural deprivation. I recall myself being involved in the project, and they wrote that in. I wrote it out, and they wrote it in anyway. And at that time the money was coming for that, and then all of a sudden if you develop a program, was it based on that, you find out that the program is going to fail because it doesn't really--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:05:17.801
The premises are wrong.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:05:17.806
--doesn't really deal with the issues that are involved.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:05:21.030
You also had the--I mean whatever the intent--the thrust of the whole--of that type of an analysis has a very, very conservative bias to it. That is to say if the problem is rooted in 300 years of malfunctioning, it's a very difficult one. And you know, programs. I mean if there are difficulties which are concrete and have a recent origin, you have a different perspective as to how to deal with them, and I think that that's another aspect of it which hasn't been given nearly enough attention.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:05:50.650
Well let's discuss with the audience some of the central themes in your book about the Black family. One theme that I deduced from it is that the Black family, despite the fact that we have been led to believe that large numbers of Black families were split up and did not have an opportunity to develop as groups, did in fact develop groups. And maybe we could--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:06:13.600
I think the best place to start is to start with--Let's talk about the slave family and then perhaps go back, come move it up into the more recent period.

00:06:24.982
I mean the big finding from which all of the questions flow is the condition, the familial condition, of Black people at the moment of emancipation. That is to say, during and right after the Civil War and one of--that came early in the study, that came very early in the study. That is to say, my assumption was very simple; if there's any truth to what Moynihan and a whole pack of sociologists and social scientists were saying, there should be more truth the closer you get back to slavery. That is to say, if the disorganization one finds in the middle of the twentieth century has its roots in something that happened in slavery, the closer you get to slavery, the more disorganization one should find. And I looked and systematically for a long time at that moment of emancipation when we should see this disorganization at its height because, you know, whatever controls owners had exercised over slaves were released were released, and it turned out that the first thing that the important findings are the following. I mean on the--at the moment of emancipation most slaves and now we're talking--we're not talking about privileged slaves, we're not talking about whatever that word means, we're not talking about drivers, we're not talking about craftsmen, we're not talking about house servants, who I think were far less privileged than most people said--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:07:48.850
The servants were very seldom really privileged.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:07:51.601
That's another story. We're talking about field hands and we're talking about laborers. We're talking that is to say about the typical slave. The typical slave who didn't live near the--in the big house--or near the big house and had none of the relative advantages that skill or, you know that kind of status brought, this a small number of slaves. Most field hands and common laborers came out of the civil war living in whole families--intact families. That's clear. And that cuts at the heart of the whole argument. Now finding out why that happened is really the problem. But that cuts right at the heart of the whole problem. Not only that, but most field hands and common laborers, who registered marriages--and here we have an extraordinary record for North Carolina--thousands of thousands of married slaves going to the courthouse to register their marriages in 1866 paying 25 cents, which is not something they had ever done before. I mean the marriage, remember, was never a legal institution in the slave period. So they were acting in new ways to legalize old arrangements and what we--what turns up in county after county in North Carolina, is not only that the typical family is an intact family, but that these are long marriages. Let's say half of the people registering marriages are registering marriages that had lasted at least 10 years with no legal sanction whatsoever. A quarter are registering marriages that had lasted at least 20 years. So here we come to the big question: what explains this? What? And I didn't know the answer to that. I mean, I had no intention when I first started this work of writing a book about the slave family. My intention was to write from the moment of emancipation forward. And then there's a vast other kind of range of evidence. I mean, there's a kind of missing persons bureau phenomenon that--I mean, systematic search for kin and for relatives--that's not in the book, that will come later in a different kind of a study, but a vast record of you know using networks to find brothers, and sisters, and children, and parents, and sometimes grandparents, cousins. Moving all across the south, through the churches to be sure, through the churches and using the churches--illiterate people having literate people write letters for them, which would then be read in the church, the letter would include a description of the child, the color of the child, when the child had been sold or given away or moved away, who the owner was, where it was probably sold. It would be read aloud saying every church in Richmond, and the people in the church would be asking if anybody knows about that child, and if nobody knew the letter would be sent to Petersburg or to Louisville. And [inaudible] this stuff was crossing all over. I mean that's just one right. But this was going on all over the place. How did that come to pass? It's inconceivable that the people who had sold the children had taught the people whose children had been sold to do this. This doesn't make sense, and it defies any kind of historical logic. So you had this vest instead of there being breakup, you see, and this gets--you get real reaffirmation and you get reconstruction. Not only do families hold together but families come back together at least most of them. The migration and the so-called disorder following the Reconstruction is this kind of a flow.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:11:15.690
Let me, let me ask this--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:11:16.380
--moving forward and backward.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:11:18.120
Let me ask this. We have a society which was built on forced labor, slavery, but we have some general information that says that the planters who own the slaves tended to reward them in certain way so they would work better. But we also have some information that says that there was a certain amount of oppression--really horrendous assaults on their dignity, their personalities, their bodies. And then we have some information that says that some of these planters broke up families and spread them all over the South. Now to what extent--from your data and your reading--to what extent was the phenomenon of breaking up families a factor or a reality, or to what extent that mostly families more or less stay together?

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:12:21.331
Well the best record we have. I mean it's--I have more material on breakup in that book than anybody's you had put together. So it's not the story of families being held together. Of course the question--and we'll come back to your question in a moment--the question is how did slaves deal with breakup? Now as far as the size, the magnitude of breakup, is concerned, my guess is that about one out of every six or seven marriages--not families--marriages was broken. It's a very high figure. It's not low. Now--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:12:53.461
That's right.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:12:53.952
--very high. This is a husband and wife separated involuntarily, separated by sale. Now of course that complicates the question of how do you reconcile that high figure with what I've been describing about the way in which most slaves came out of--most Black people came out of slavery. You also have--now that doesn't begin to get to the magnitude of family breakup involving children because all most slaves who were sold were not husbands or separated from wives or wives separated from husbands. They were grown children detached from families. So we're not measuring in any way the magnitude of family breakup. It's very high. And it's a continual and ever present part center of the institution especially between 1800 and 1860 because that's--well what happened in that half century was the involuntary movement of about half a million Black people from the upper south to the lowest south.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:13:55.750
We're talking this evening with Dr. Herbert Gutman who's the author of the new book, "The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom." This massive movement of people, one of the largest movements of people in history.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:14:08.220
I think it's the large--It's certainly, in the 19th century, it's the largest forced migration of people in the Western world. There's nothing, nothing to compare to it. An internal migration is just nothing like it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:14:19.880
And what you're saying is that during this time, this was probably the time when family breakups were maximized.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:14:26.521
Oh sure.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:14:27.260
And in terms of an estimate, about how many families were broken? Was it most families that were broken--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:14:33.123
There's no way. We'll never get it. The point of the matter is that the flow and the, you know, the spread of cotton culture, the spread of the plantation system threatened every family. So that--I mean, one of the things I argue in the book is that one of the functions of the family painful as it was, was to socialize the child to prepare for that as it grew up as a real possibility. Now if it didn't happen, the family was lucky. But the parents had to teach the child, the grandparents had to teach the child, an aunt had to teach the child, an uncle that this was the real world they were growing up in and one of the reasons that slaves managed the experience was because of what they learned in those families about precisely that experience.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:15:15.810
And of course what you're really portraying very beautifully is the structure of a social institution--in this instance, the Black family that enabled Black people to survive because basically--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:15:28.921
Oh, I don't-- it's more than survival.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:15:31.021
Well, all right I like it. Okay. Well, what I'm developing is that--if there had not been this structure--the, just the health problems, the brutality, the oppression we just cause-- People just give up.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:15:44.331
That's right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:15:44.901
And what you say; not only did they survive but they-- [crosstalk] and--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:15:49.663
It's created. It's an infrastructure that's created between individual slave and the owner, which protects the slave from the dehumanization implicit in ownership.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:16:00.441
Give an example. That's a very good point.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:16:02.331
Well for example one of the things that we've been led to believe is that the slave father had no role. Owners, for example, rarely, if--in spite of what's been written in recent books--owners rarely, if ever, recorded the name of a father in a birthplace when they kept birth lists. These were not kept in Bibles, to be sure, they were kept in business records. These were asset lists. In the same way that they kept--would keep-- a list of, you know, of sales of cotton or purchase of manure or something--an increase in horses. The birth lists rarely, if ever, records the name of the father. The slave father has no presence in the law as a significant figure, and yet, slave parents are always regularly naming children for slave fathers. We know that now. I mean, we can see that by looking at the way in which the family system and kinship system worked. It just comes off the page--not only are slave sons name for fathers--slave daughters are named for fathers. Josephine is named for her father Joseph, Georgiana is named for her father George. I mean, that's what we begin to pull out of this now. Now that's a very that's not an insignificant act. That's a very significant choice that's been made by those parents or by the other persons who help name the child. It's not--it was not clear who among the slaves was naming children that were--it may have been a grandparent who was naming the children. So what we're getting in other words is a whole range of choices that slaves were making--constricted and painfully so--painfully so constricted. But within the constrictions, a whole range of choices having to do with the process of retaining an identity independent of the identity imposed upon them and asked of them by their owners. Now this book deals with one aspect of it. I mean, with the family and with a kin group, it doesn't deal with the full range of choices that slaves were making. That's another that's a lot of other books. Now what gives the family the significance, that I think it deserves, is that the family became the institutions. In spite of how it was treated, through which over time slaves were able to pass on you know morality as I mean to put it in its most funda--you know--rules, morality, all sorts of notions from generation to generation so that the individual slave growing up in the 1830's wasn't simply some isolated man or woman cut off and talking to one only--because if that's what it was then Elkins is right. I mean, then you have Sambo. It's very easy to make that person into Sambo and that would have been the case. What you have is that individual slave is the product of a cumulative experience that several generations old by the 1830's so that the slaves who are sold into the Deep South--and painfully cut off from the world that meant a great deal to them--carry with them into the Deep South a whole range of beliefs associated with everyday life. I mean beliefs about marriage, beliefs about sex, beliefs about courtship--that they act on in a slave way in Mississippi, and in Arkansas, and in Texas and recreate precisely what they've been cut off from.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:19:27.140
Well what do you think about the allegation that the slaves were willing accomplices in the plan of hegemony that they--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:19:35.720
I don't--I have-- Well, you read my book and you'll see what I think of that. That's an-- That's a construct. That's not the real world that the slaves lived in. That is to say, that you sent that argument rests on the assumption that the slaves had no choice but to enter into that relationship. And it turns out that the slaves had that choice. Some did. There's no question--and I mean that's not the argument when I'm talking about some slaves. I mean what the problems the slaves faced--I mean, from the familial--let's look at it from a family perspective. The problem the slaves faced, an individual slave faced, as parent was how best to protect his or her child. Some slaves opted for protection through forming a relationship with an owner. That's not surprising. That's perfectly appropriate, but most don't--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:20:20.962
--happen to 1976 too.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:20:22.391
Sure it does. But most owners didn't offer that kind of protection in spite of what Professor generously suggests. Most didn't, and slaves had other ways in which they could protect their children and that is to say instead of opting for a relationship with an owner they would create relationships with other slaves. I mean, one of the things I studied that great in great detail in the book as a clue to precisely this question--I mean it's not it's not anthropology but social history--are the names that slave parents gave to their children. And it's not simply that slave children were named for their fathers. I mean that's--that didn't have to happen to give a larger part in the significance it deserves what's of interest is that in looking at plantation slaves and, by the way and also looking at farm slaves, I do not accept the notion that we know a lot about the plantations and not enough about the farms because plantation slaves were mostly born farm slaves and when we see them acting as plantation slaves they are acting in ways that are no different from farm slaves. What we notice is that on all of the plantations that I studied and studied; over a hundred year period, in some instances 70 year period roughly speaking, about two at least--this is a minimal estimate--at least two out of five newborn slave children were named for blood relatives. That is to say, were named for aunts, for uncles, for grandparents, sometimes for great grandparents for great aunts. These were all slave relatives. Now what that symbolizes, what that signifies, is not simply that they knew who their grandparents were or aunts and uncles, whatever. I mean that's not what it's about. I mean that's interesting. But what that begins to tell us is something about the importance slaves attached, not to the family, but to the relations between families. And once we began talking about the relations between families among slaves we're talking about kinship, not about family. We're talking about the relationships between two grown brothers or a grown sister and her brother. Now we're talking about how one family supports and sustains another family. And we're also talking about the way in which the death of a parent or two parents or the sale of a parent--who took care of that child? The owner? Who took care of that child? No such racket exists. That child was taken care of by its mother's sister or brother. Now when we start looking at those kinds of relationships, we get away from how many slaves lived in two--most slaves live in two parent families--but we get away from that question because it's really a much less important question than what I think and what we're not talking about and what we're also talking about how kinship became--I think again an argument is made at great length, a great length in the book-- how kinship became community. So that what you see is the development of a slave community out of these networks of blood and marriage.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:23:21.130
Now did these particular patterns continue doing reconstruction or were they gradually deteriorated resulting in the ultimate situation which we now see in urban America? Where I think it's 38 percent of black families are headed by--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:23:36.401
Now that finding, which I think is the central finding in the book, has to be studied backwards and forwards. And one of the things, for example, we need to pay an awful lot of attention to is where does it come from? It seems quite clear to me on the basis of the material I've looked at that that network that kin world that develops among the slaves is in no way imitative of what the whites are doing and that what its origins are is that these are adaptive African practices. I know there's any question about that just how that happened is something that requires an enormous amount of study but after all one of the things that's characteristic of all--in different ways--of all African tribal societies is precisely this relationship between families is precisely the function of kinship--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:24:26.011
What we call often the extended family.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:24:28.042
Well that's what we're talking about. Now that building of that--it's not an African thing, by the way, when it develops in the new world or in Virginia or South Carolina because it's detached from its African origins--it begins, it starts in Africa. If you like music--I mean the same way that jazz isn't African--it's Afro-American music and the same thing is true with what we're talking about that is to say it's a process that is Black history. The Black family starts in Africa. The history the Black family, and it becomes something different. Why it becomes what it does is the way in which African people and their Afro-American descendants innovate and create new structures, not to deal with everyday needs of tribal society in West Africa, but to deal with slavery and what slavery is doing to them. What happens afterward? I don't--the book doesn't do too much with that. That's one of the weaknesses in the book. It's perfectly clear that that Kin World does not disintegrate in the rural South. I mean I don't--you don't have to read my book. You have to just read Nate Shaw to see the power of that world in his life. I mean that book is just filled with--with this--with kin obligation. His world is built around kinship in the sharecropping world. That needs desperately to be studied and we not only studied in the rural south what happened to that in that migration to the north.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:25:54.820
The one point that I observed from your book are two things that impressed me greatly. One, I enjoyed your analysis about the names and that was something that helps to spread out the whole idea of this kinship network. The other was the reliance on economic interpretations rather than cultural interpretations. I am not exactly sure that most people who reviewed the book have picked up that particular.

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:26:21.050
No, I don't think so. No, I quite agree with that.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:26:24.270
It is certainly--and as you look at the changes in the family structures and adapted mechani--and what is it adapting to? Well, it is adapting to the poverty and economic exploitation--

Dr. Herbert Gutman 00:26:34.181
Take Carol Stack's book, "All Our Kin," which is certainly the best book on contemporary black ghetto family life by far. One of the things that she notices is the existence in this terribly poor and suffering world. I mean it's not--It's a very, very painful story in the same way that slavery is painful. What she notices is a range of networks existing in this world among the poor. If we're gonna talk about public policy maybe what we should be doing is supporting those networks and not the families. Building to that, I mean, that's a kind of a--it's a welfare--it's a welfare state of its own. Now, that existed under slavery. I can tell you that in great detail and I know it exists--it still exists--in the rural South. The system of reciprocal exchanges that take place between sharecroppers in Holmes County, Mississippi has been splendidly documented. Now, there are problems. However, how well that moves into one urban environment is a subject that needs badly to be studied. In other words, in what economic settings does that work relatively better than in one type of economic setting than in another? It seems to me that it had to be working in Harlem in the 1920s, otherwise what the census data shows would not have turned up. Now, something, something in the--we need-- We're running out of time and I'm trying to make a big point and it has to do of course with the last 50 years. That's--we'll to do another program on that and--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown,  Jr 00:28:05.231
We'll have to do another program; you certainly will have to do another book. I want to thank our guest Dr. Herbert Gutman, author of the new book, "The Black family and Slavery and Freedom" for very incisive analysis of the strengths of the Black family. This book brings an insight that is sorely needed for public policy people, as well as students and scholars. Thanks again for being our guest.
