This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. Soul of reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:00:48.550
Many of today's parents are looking for alternate ways to educate their children. A creative private school has been organized by Mrs. Jamelle Patterson and is called the Patterson School. Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we will be talking with Jamelle Patterson and one of her teachers Diane McDonald and we glad to have both you ladies with us this evening.

Jamelle Patterson 00:01:08.860
Glad to be here.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:01:09.881
And I guess you're glad school is out.

Diane McDonald 00:01:12.673
Well we're going to miss the children over the summer. The offices are still open and it gets kind of empty and lonesome up there working and not hearing those pleasant little voices and sometimes the unpleasant little voices, too. [laughs]

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:01:25.150
And Diane, as I was saying when were getting ready for the program, the children now can be safe cause you won't beat them anymore. Children, you have to deal with them in a lot of different ways, I imagine.

Diane McDonald 00:01:34.091
Absolutely.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:01:34.991
Well let's begin by talking about the need for a Black oriented private school. Let's say in New York City, but let's also say anywhere.

Jamelle Patterson 00:01:43.990
All right. Well first of all, let me tell you what the Patterson school is. We began in March of 1976 as a not-for-profit educational institution. At that time, offering supplementary education after school in the areas of mathematics, language, arts and reading. The reasoning being that children from any other school --private or public-- could come to us after school for a total of four hours a week and receive either enrichment or remediation in the areas that I just mentioned. This was in response to the fact that youngsters in general --and particularly Black youngsters-- are suffering a 10 year decline nationally, and particularly in the areas of mathematics and reading and writing as evidenced by the scholastic aptitude and other measuring, national measuring devices. We wanted to offer a means of correcting this problem, having the youngsters come to an environment where they could receive extra training in those areas. However, we decided to --in addition to offering the after-school classes for any youngster that wants to come to our school-- to offer in addition full day classes: regular private school, from kindergarten through fourth grade. This being because there are parents who want their children not just to receive supplementary education which will help them to get through their public school, for example, or whatever school they are attending, but to send their children to a school where they can be assured that the youngsters will receive quality education. The youngsters will be able to --at the end of a year-- make progress in computing math, make the normal progress in learning how to read, in writing and in all of the other subject areas that are offered in school. So the school now has become a model for... a model institution where by quality education is offered, quality and effective education is offered young people on a full day basis as well as an after-school basis.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:04:08.960
It seems to me I heard those terms quality and effective education from the New York City Board of Education, from the New York State Board of Regents, from the New Jersey Board of Regents, etc.. So what I'm really reflecting is that quality education has become a cliché, and I'll ask Diane, as a teacher, what do you consider quality education to be?

Diane McDonald 00:04:30.101
I think where the quality comes about in the Patterson School is the interest of the teachers in their students and the expectations that they have for the students which are conveyed to the students in many different ways, many subtle ways. And the children get the message that they are respected and appreciated and loved and expected to do great things. So consequently their education and their involvement in their education, the level of it, all moves up to a higher plane.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:05:07.240
You've said something that a number of people in education have said, and that is that one of the things that contributes to the crisis in Black education --I think you'd have to say there is a crisis in that Black children are not learning as well as they have the potential to learn-- is that many of the teachers --particularly in the public systems-- do not have the expectation that Black children will learn, and then added to that, the class concerns and the race concerns that cause low income people --many of whom are Black-- and Black people to be disrespected as people by people from the majority group and sometimes by people from their own group. So I'm going to ask you, Jamelle, what about the cliché that says that Black teachers will teach Black children better? Recognizing that you're black, you've organized a school primarily with black children and is oriented around the Black cultural ethos. Do you believe, in fact, with all other things being equal, that Black teachers will teach Black children better? And if so why? And if not, why not?

Jamelle Patterson 00:06:12.570
OK. Well that actually gets back to your first question which I realize now that I didn't really answer. I got sidetracked on telling what the school is. I think that it is high time that Black people do take control over the education of our children. It is obvious that this has not happened to this point. And Black folk have not been in control. So that, even if we find out ten years from now the Black folk don't --Black teachers and Black educators-- do not do a better job than the educators who have up to this point been doing the teaching, at least we will have known that there is some other ingredient in the equation that we don't know about. However, it is my feeling that it is human nature to look out for oneself and one's own group, that Black people therefore acting upon human instinct would be concerned about our own children's educational needs and educational progress in a very personal way. Every other ethnic group would and should act the same way.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:07:21.840
Well, let's look at the logic behind that. The Brown case, the 1954 school desegregation decision, said that separate schools were not equal and they had a long heritage in many, many places of all-Black schools or Black school system producing students who did not perform particularly well. Although there are... [crosstalk] Well let me just carry on for a minute. Although there are some Black schools, like the Dunbar High Schools, that have been in Washington, and Roosevelt, and Gary, Indiana, and schools of that type where there was a great deal of achievement in terms of their graduates. But one of the concerns that many people have said as we were going into community control, and where black communities did want to control their own schools, et cetera --and you have some instances of that in places like Newark-- is that: are we going back to a resegregation? If all-Black was so good, is so good now, what happened when it was operating before? So how do you deal with that particular aspect of the logic that's involved? Diane you wanted to say something.

Diane McDonald 00:08:35.130
Yes I think that the difference lies within the school. What Jamal was just saying about those schools, segregated schools were not actually run by Blacks. Blacks were kept within a particular school system --a portion of the school system-- and the allocation of supplies and resources was limited, because it was operated on a segregated basis. I think when you get an all-Black school run by Blacks you get in it the interest in really making it a good curriculum and you get the control. And one of the main points is you get the images for the children of seeing their... the adults in their lives as in control of their futures, and able to operate a school, able to pass on an education, able to run that portion that segment of society. So I think that's the important point.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:09:38.190
Of course you've talked a lot, both of you, talked about interest and attitude, but education requires a lot more than interest and attitude, it requires a lot of money.

Jamelle Patterson 00:09:46.531
Absolutely.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:09:47.071
And one of the concerns that you must have as a private school is trying to work out some way of getting the type of support for your school. How many children do you have, for example, and how many of them are on scholarship and how many of them actually pay? How is that coming along? For our after-school classes, we average 75 students a semester. The youngsters do pay tuition, and youngsters who are not able to pay the full tuition, and are therefore on a scholarship, the scholarship funds are given to the school by one of our contributors so that in fact, everyone is paying. The school does not have a scholarship fund in reserve at this point. We are concerned about the budget. I think that you can have a school that has an excellent staff and an excellent curriculum in the highest of intentions and if there is not enough money to operate the schools, and of course the school is not going to live up to the expectations which have been set. A group has been organized by Arthur Barnes [?] who is the chairman of our Board of Trustees entitled The Friends of the Patterson School, and they meet once a month during the regular school year from September through June to raise funds for the school. In addition we have applied for and been granted some funds through the private sector. Because we have a modest budget, we are not comfortable yet as far as having money in reserve, but we have been able to operate for the time that we have run. Now beginning in September with our full day classes, we are projecting starting with 60 students. We will of course have to watch our budget very carefully and we are of course sending out proposals to the foundations and to continue with our support, to continue pursuing the support from our contributors who have supported us in the past. Well you are at that stage of development where you're really in genesis and things are happening and you're talking about the importance of private schools and the importance of teachers who care whether it's public or private. You have the advantage now of being small. One of the real questions in terms of providing quality education for the society. For example, in New York City, there are a million children in the public schools. Now your 60 is an important to those 60 children and to their parents. To what extent do you think that private education can in fact be the solution to educational problems for Black children in New York City?

Jamelle Patterson 00:12:35.980
That's a good question. First of all we will continue with our after-school classes which will grow in size and the methods of teaching which we use in our full day classes will also be used in our after-school classes for all of those other students who are not in our school. And secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we are becoming and want to remain a model, so that we can relate to other public... private as well as public schools which service a large number of black children and say: listen, we have developed some very effective ways of teaching mathematics, and we have developed some very effective ways of teaching reading, and our children succeed in those areas, and we'd like to pass this on to you. I think it would be difficult for me to go into a public school and do the same thing. So you need a private school as a base for doing... documenting the kind of success that we can have.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:13:32.150
This is a rationale that's frequently given for private schools that they will --and private universities for that matter-- that they will demonstrate things that can be picked up in the public sector. One of the problems though is that when they are picked up in the public sector, something happens. Part of it is just the large number of people, and I guess another part of it is the bureaucracies and the unions and things of this type. So you do have a challenge in that way. Quite possibly you might be onto something in terms of beginning to get people, particularly in the Black community, to be thinking about alternate ways of educating Black children. For those who are interested in the Patterson School, where is it located, and how can those in the audience get in touch with you or with the school?

Jamelle Patterson 00:14:18.370
We are located at 425 West 144th Street, which is at Convent Avenue. The telephone number is 690 3300. That's 690 3300.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:14:33.591
We've talked about education of Black children. Obviously as a public institution you can't discriminate...

Jamelle Patterson 00:14:39.194
Absolutely

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:14:40.061
...according to race, but do you particularly encourage an integrated class setting of white children, encouraged to join the Patterson School, at the same time recognize that you have a limited number of spaces?

Jamelle Patterson 00:14:54.310
Well, actually, we have not specifically said you know this school is only for Black children or qualified what kind of children can come to the school. Our location probably determines that the largest number of children will be Black. However, in September for our full day classes we have youngsters with Hispanic surnames who will be entering the school, and we would welcome children of any ethnic group into our school. Some parents from the Lower the Upper West Side in the 90s actually did come up to our school --white parents-- to find out what our curriculum was like and felt that the transportation was a little rough for them. However, as I indicated any parents who are interested in having their children attend to school which are skills oriented, where the curriculum is individualized and where their children will... where our staff will make every effort to make sure that within a given school year, there is the normal progress in the academic as well as non-academic school areas. Any of those parents are welcome.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:16:03.811
Tonight, on "Soul of Reason," we are talking with Jamelle Patterson, Director and Diane McDonnell, Teacher of the Patterson School which is located on West 144 street now as you were talking about these type of programs that you have for young people and in fact that some of the children might be white do you think there might be some advantage to a white youngster going to a predominantly black school as a personality development situation. What about that Diane.

Speaker 10 00:16:33.170
Well my comment goes back to your previous question about is what can a private school do to right the wrongs and cure the ills. And I'm just thinking that what the Patterson School is attempting to do is to make up for a deficit in education of not only our youngsters I guess but for all youngsters and that is the transmission of more knowledge about the Afro American heritage and cultural background for every child to learn more about that would be good.

Speaker 11 00:17:09.560
It's paramount and crucial that black children learn about their heritage.

Speaker 10 00:17:14.720
And when you speak of 60 children or 80 children being exposed to this or only the children who can afford to pay the tuition you're you're really recognizing that the many children who need this are not going to be touched. And it should serve as a model and it should expand and in some way it should be extended to all children in order to not only increase the self-image of black children but to increase the respect for blacks by all other groups. And so it's just a transmission of our cultural heritage that has got to be done in some type of way.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:17:56.540
Well as a teacher of many many things that can be transmitted about black people through your curriculum through your activities. What do you think the most important thing is that the High Court.

Speaker 12 00:18:12.980
Select out of thousands of incidents and situations is any particular theme about black people that you try to transmit to you.

Speaker 10 00:18:23.220
I think the theme would be of being individuals and being an individual group in the sense that every group has their heroes and their villains every group has their geniuses and their mediocre people. And to recognize that as black people we are another group and that we've got to learn more about our group. It's just a matter of figuring out where you fall within all of society and within the world of peoples.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:18:54.860
Well that's a good thing. As an individual but you're talking about transforming the cultural heritage you know maybe you want to get in on this.

Jamelle Patterson 00:19:02.050
Well I think that it is important that young people black students know of our groups long and rich culture and heritage Deming from the beginning of time in Africa to now you see and I think it should be done in a very natural way normal way. And I'll elaborate on that in a minute but the point is that black folk have been youngsters have been taught up to this point that our history begins with slavery and we start with the Middle Passage and then everything else is dealt with being enslaved and then overcoming the problems which have resulted as a result of which have resulted because of our enslaved MIT and black children get the mistaken impression that our group began as slaves which is just not the truth. We were a free people on the continent of Africa who became enslaved in just about every other group in history has also become enslaved at one time or another so that if we transmit to our children our groups long and rich heritage as well as a bit about world history to juxtapose our history along with world history I think that young people will develop a very positive self concept which really is the bottom line of what you're trying to deal with in that particular aspect of the development.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:20:25.070
Now from the cognitive or the academic side what do you place most stress on reading math or the two together. Because I know parents particularly parents who send their kids to private school are very concerned about how well their kids read and how well they can add and multiply and divide and strain. What do you place emphasis on.

Speaker 13 00:20:50.840
How do you go about dealing with that particular thing you've talked about the affective the attitude and so on now we talk about the cognitive the academic intellect right what we feel is very important to be able to do both to be able to read well and to understand what is being read as well as to be able to compute math. I don't think that you can have one without the other. It's just important. It's impossible to live effectively in this type of society if one can't compute math a cave and balance your checking account as an adult. It's also very important that one read well and to speak well to speak good English and and to write effectively and so those four things are very important in our curriculum. One may be stressed more than another with any of any individual child one particular child may be say a second grader may be particularly gifted in math and so therefore not particularly advanced in reading and so for that child reading may be stressed more than math.

Jamelle Patterson 00:21:55.460
But just in general in the school I don't think that we can that I could say that one particular skills area is more important than the other.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:22:04.280
Well as you develop these skills you certainly do run into a variety of teaching approaches. Is any particular approach that you tend to use Diane over another.

Speaker 12 00:22:17.690
My approach is a very eclectic approach.

Speaker 11 00:22:23.480
The main thing is that it's a highly individualized approach within a structured environment where the child is free to move about and choose work based upon their own interests and their own needs. I have served as a director within the classroom directing the children toward purposeful activity toward skills training that would help them to function more effectively individually and independently.

Speaker 10 00:22:51.950
And the approach is mainly to allow the child to feel a sense of responsibility for his learning and to be freed to to choose the things that they want to do because that's when learning is most effective our parent listening to this. I would see in vision these little children running all over the place and standing up just walking around. What do you like to do this. And Mary would you like to do that. And no that's not what happens. Most of the time I have some happen sometime. So in terms of you know after you've gotten what I call the education years after you've gotten the education needs together and then what did you what do you really do. You know you talked about being free and observing kids. Do you give children any formal instruction or do they just learn by doing and by happenstance.

Speaker 11 00:23:45.370
Much of the learning is it comes about as a result of them manipulating the educational materials in the classroom. It is a directed approach in that during a morning work period which we have. I would work with each child on an individual basis when I'm not working with the rest of the class. Then those children should be busy on their own. So it's a matter of learning from other children learning from manipulation of the materials and learning from direct contact with the teacher in an end of individualized instructional setting.

Jamelle Patterson 00:24:23.050
I'd like to just add to that I think he did what a key to Diane's approach into the approach that lots of our many of our teachers use is using Diane's words freedom with any well-defined structure that the approach is structure. The children know what the limits are.

Speaker 13 00:24:38.920
They know what is expected of them but yet we do give them the freedom to move about in the room and to have to exercise some decision making process regarding their learning. This of course along with that freedom of choice comes responsibility. And if the child if the child abuse is it and spends his time playing then of course the teacher exercises a much more direct role in instructing their child as to what he should be doing.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:25:07.040
Well of course I've asked Do the two of you of the most difficult questions in the world answer and that is how do you teach society in general has the idea of a teacher of being in front of a group of people telling them something and it's obvious from your response that you don't perceive the role of the teacher to be mainly that of telling someone something on the other hand the question comes up is well how do kids learn if you don't tell them. Because if they just learn by the experience all they'd have to do is to go out in the street and play all the time. And they would learn. So how do you know I'm a parent now imagine you as a director you're going to get me to spend my money to send my kids to your school. I want to find out who is going to come out knowing something. All right. Well obviously there are times when a teacher does have to tell a child something where a child has to read facts in a textbook a history book a math book and so on. I think that what we're trying to convey is that all of learning should not be about a an adult telling a child. Knowledge becomes or becomes obsolete so quickly now facts that has become obsolete so quickly now. And I think it is important that we in addition to imparting knowledge to children teach children how to think more so than what to think. There's an African proverb that says you can give a man a fish and he's full for the day and you can teach a man how to fish and he's full for the rest of his life. I think that is the basis of our approach to education. Yes we must impart knowledge. But at the same time we must teach our children how to think for themselves when they leave us.

Speaker 12 00:26:44.650
All right Diane as a teacher how do you respond elaborating upon that.

Speaker 11 00:26:48.070
I think that the teacher's role should be to set up the circumstances for the child to discover certain facts for themselves set up the curriculum in such a way that you see that the children are exposed to what they should be during that year and then allow them to discover those facts of learning for themselves as we come to the close of our program this evening.

Dr. Rosco C. Brown Jr. 00:27:10.680
Do you have you learned anything you think might be helpful to schools in general as a result of your experience.

Speaker 13 00:27:19.540
I think that one very key thing that we have learned is that schools should be a lot more child oriented than they have been in the past.

Jamelle Patterson 00:27:30.310
Key to what we have just been discussing these few minutes that if we view the child as a learner as a person who is naturally inquisitive who wants to explore to learn to create that we can help a lot more. And facilitating their learning and if that's true at the Patterson School that's why it is an exciting place and will continue to be an exciting place.
