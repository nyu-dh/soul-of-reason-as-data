Paul Robeson was one of our legendary Black heroes. The Paul Robeson Archives are now being organized by a group of distinguished people headed by Paul Robeson Jr. Hear him discuss the Paul Robeson Archives on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:38.341
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:04.920
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" is Paul Robeson Jr., who is heading up the development of the Paul Robeson Archives. And Paul, first, I would like to welcome you to our show tonight. Glad to have you with us.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:01:15.811
Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:17.221
And I also want to congratulate you on the recent fundraiser that you had at Carnegie Hall. The Artists' Salute to Paul Robeson, which I hope raised some money for the archives. And then I'd like you to begin by just telling us what you feel the purpose -- the main purpose of the Paul Robeson Archives is.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:01:39.720
Well, the purpose of the archives is to assemble all of the material by, on, or about Paul Robeson in one place, in its proper context. And there is an enormous amount of material that we already have, for example, especially in areas that people are not very familiar with. My father, among other things, was a great scholar. I mean, he knew some 24 languages. He read enormous numbers of books on the cultures' of peoples all over the world and he created a significant body of writing. His own writing, all of which has been preserved, including vast correspondence between him and people all over the world and in the United States. Many of the Great Renaissance figures, like Dr. Du Bois, and great musicians of the Renaissance period. And so we have -- we are in the process of organizing all this material, cataloging it so that it can be made available to people all over this country and all over the world. Our aim is to put it in a major Black institution, where it can be properly housed and, particularly, can be made, through microfilm and other means, available to people in libraries and schools around the country.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:11.730
And of course that is a monumental job to pull together the papers of any person who's lived in the public domain is difficult, but to pull together the papers, and artifacts, and the concerns of someone as great as your father is just a monumental task. And of course this requires money -- requires money for the very, very time consuming assiduous job of cataloging and putting them into an appropriate location. And so that scholars can reach in and do the cross referencing. I know that there's a project that a Black historian by the name of John Blassingame is doing on the "Frederick Douglass Papers." I also know that there has been a project dealing with the "W.E.B. Du Bois Papers," which has fallen on the shoals of legal concerns between his widow, Shirley Graham Dubois, and some of the other people that had some of the other papers. I gather in your instance, at least at the present time, you haven't had any particular problem gaining access to most of the papers and works of your father. Is that correct?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:04:27.420
That's correct. As a matter of fact, the basic collection was kept through the years by my mother, who died some 12 years ago, but kept more or less the entire collection intact. And as far as other papers, other tapes, film -- people in general, have been very cooperative in providing us either, in some cases, with originals, but in other cases with adequate copies, which are adequate for our purposes. So we've had a great deal of cooperation. Except there is a great deal of material that, during the 1950s, the so-called McCarthy Period, was confiscated by various agencies of the United States Government and they are -- have not and are not being cooperative in the sense that they haven't released the material including a great deal of film. We are demanding that -- the family is demanding that -- through the Freedom of Information Act.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:26.280
I was about to say with the new [crosstalk]

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:05:28.411
[Laughter] And we shall persevere in that and, of course, people should be made aware that a great amount of material has been confiscated in that manner and any pressures that they bring to bear on the powers that be of course will be helpful in that respect.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:05:44.201
And of course aside from the fact that, to any of us who grew up with the image of your father above us, in front of us, you know he's the only one person you'd talk about. I was in sports, I was an academician, etc. The person you wanted to be like was Paul Robeson because that was the Black Superman in a sense, not only in terms of his athletic endeavors, in his scholarly endeavors, his artistic endeavors, but also his commitment to human dignity. And unfortunately, because of the way in which the country moved in the late 40s, really, and in the 50s, we have this almost -- it isn't an 18 minute gap on the tape it's almost like an 18 year gap on the tape -- where specific efforts were taken to besmirch Paul Robeson's name and certain specific acts were done such as pulling back his passport, confiscating papers, and so on, which really is a blight on American democracy and the Freedom of Information Act certainly should help to break this. But I was wondering, because one of the sad things about a society is that very few people are really truly recognized for their significance while they are alive, it's only afterwards that, all of a sudden, people who were critical in this and that begin to say, "Ah.That's a great person," and so on. I was wondering if you found much of that, as you've gone about organizing the campaign to develop the archives. Have you found much of people now saying, "Well look, I was wrong."? Or, even if they didn't say they were wrong, they are finally recognizing the real significance of the life of your father?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:07:32.440
Well, I think partly because of events and -- before his death -- I think the process of recognition had begun. I think the crucial factor was the increased awareness of their own history among Black people of many generations in this country. I think it's an aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement and I think that the pressure from all segments of the Black community compelled the public at large to begin to recognize the significance of my father's life. So that history itself, before his death, had began that process. I think it's accelerated since his death and that the issues that he posed for the society remain and they remain in the new context as controversial as they were. And people's response to his life takes that into account. I do not think that the powers that be, who attempted to erase him from history and the media that they control, I do not believe that at root their attitude has changed now. Their tactics may have changed but the challenge that he posed to the foundations of racism in this society -- its economic, political, and cultural foundations -- remains as a fundamental and severe challenge. And I think their reaction to it is still...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:08.442
Of course week after week as we do "Soul of Reason," we get examples of the virulence of racism. We also get examples of great struggles against it. And as you might note, some successes, you're right. The base -- at least in my opinion -- the basic roots still remain. And that's the reason why a figure like Paul Robeson remains ever so much to be studied. Because out of your struggles and out of your oppressions and your battles against oppression, you do gain some insights into, not only the reality of the situation, but some strategies or counter strategies that might be involved in this. Because your father, in a sense, was a tremendously multifaceted person -- he cut across the worlds of sports, and he cut across the worlds of scholarship, worlds of entertainment, worlds of politics -- as you've begun to construct these archives have you found more cooperation from one segment of his life's base than the other? Has the entertainment field been more responsive, or the sports field, or the education field, or the political field? How has this response been developed?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:10:25.270
I think the response has been good across the board. I think people who have information on my father, who were associated with him in one way or another, have come forward, both here and abroad, and have been really, very helpful. For example when it comes to tape film, I mean agencies like the British Broadcasting Corporation, Russian documentary film television, French television, whoever have been very, very cooperative. Many of the African countries, Caribbean countries, have volunteered and sent information from their archives and so on. As I say, the only problem we have had, strangely enough, even take film. We have the anomaly that vastly more film has been acquired by the archives from abroad -- from sources like the sources I mentioned -- than from the United States. The problem once again is that the many -- much of that material -- audio and video material -- has been -- was actually confiscated during the McCarthy years. So, to sum up, as far as individuals or institutions go -- basically here and abroad -- we've had great cooperation.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:47.101
All right. Let's tell our audience about how they might help: monetarily, helping with collecting some of the material, including giving us your address and your phone number. That's very important when you want to get in touch.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:12:03.330
Right. Well, there are two levels. First of all, of course, knowledge about material of any kind whether they be home tape recordings. Radio, for example, programs -- which there were many of during the 1940s and 1930s -- film of all kinds, documentary and otherwise, and documents, letters. Anyone with knowledge of things like that, if they would communicate with us, would be excellent. And, of course, we always need funds. We've had to rely basically on individual contributions, income from public events like the tribute Monday night, and from various small foundations. But [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:12:49.743
But what is your address and phone number? [laughter]

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:12:52.470
[Laughter] Our address is 157 West 57th. Street, New York, New York, 10019. And our phone number is area code 212-265-6260. And we're called [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:04.601
265?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:13:04.603
6260

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:04.605
6260. And that's the Paul Robeson Archives?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:13:08.670
The Paul Robeson Archives. Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:11.370
And that's for individuals who want to give financial contributions or have some materials that they would want to donate to the archives.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:13:19.471
Or who wish to know about information on Paul Robeson whether you get material.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:23.703
Because that is one of the things we want to talk about. And that is that, even as you are collecting this, I imagine there are some scholars who are using the archives. Is that correct?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:13:33.720
That's true. We have developed a listing of materials that are available both from us and from other sources. And we've provided materials to many libraries. To documentary filmmakers who've done two films already and another one is being worked on. People who want material to write doctorate theses. Many other things.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:56.761
As much of this research is being done, I imagine that some people are thinking about films. Whenever you have a great figure, and the figure passes away, people rush to say, "Well, let's do a film on this person. Let's do a film." Obviously, the life of your father so significant that it lends itself to many different portrayals and interpretations. How do you plan to handle that? I'm sure you must have had several approaches. How do you plan to look into that? Because I know it's just a monumental undertaking to be involved in that project.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:14:36.001
Well, of course we have been approached by many different sources, but our primary consideration is to really organize this collection and make it available to the public --as task number one. And I think other things really rest, in a certain sense, on that. Because, for a film or -- you know -- a series of recordings -- or whatever -- to appear, they should appear in context, and the archives provides that context. Not in terms of what others say about my father, so much but what he himself said, wrote, did. And it's portrayed in every [unintelligible], in every nuance, in every way -- in film, on film, on tapes, in his own writings, and so on. So, this task can be completed if we get sufficient funding -- quite readily in the next -- perhaps as soon as six months. That is, within a year, we're confident we can have completed this task. And my first consideration in terms of film is a documentary film. But I think the most important thing for the American public, or any other public, to see is Paul Robeson as Paul Robeson. It is secondary, in my mind, for anyone to see a fictional Paul Robeson, particularly since for almost two decades the real Paul Robeson was kept off, certainly the visual media. He never appeared in his entire life on American television -- even on a talk show -- only and bits of documentary or newsreel footage. So that the real Paul Robeson ought to be available on film to the public before there is a fictional one. And, in this case, people tell me, "Well, you know, the money is in commercial film." Well, I'm not concerned with that. He wasn't throughout his time. As a matter of fact, he always put principle ahead of financial gain. And I intend to do exactly the same thing. When a film is done, it should be done based on the true Robeson. And, since I -- his own policy in films was he would never do a film unless he could have the final cut. I will certainly never be associated with a film on Paul Robeson unless I have final cut. And I think that is one of the major problems, certainly, in doing a studio film with the major studios, which I would eliminate out of hand. It would have to be done independently. So I think that's a complicated thing -- and down the road apiece, I think.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:17:24.921
Of course. I can easily see the reasoning behind wanting the documentary film to proceed the so-called fictional history. Because recent film history is filled with films that allegedly deal with a particular person -- or a particular [unintelligible] -- so much so they've even coined a new phrase in the film business, a fictional history -- or the publishing business -- a fictional history, which is kind of interesting. How do you really do that? But certainly I can see the logic behind developing a documentary. Now you had suggested -- or you had said earlier -- that you think, if you get the funding, you get the project -- in terms of the papers and so on -- in place in six to eight months. What type of money are you talking about, if you don't mind talking about it? What type of resource does it really take to do the pulling of the materials together? And then, of course, we're going to talk about the type of resources it takes to put it into a library in an appropriate place.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:18:23.090
We estimate that, in order to complete the job, we need a total of 50 thousand dollars. We've -- the affair, the tribute -- the artist tribute to Paul Robeson on Monday night at Carnegie Hall has raised close to half of that. So we're almost halfway there. We need another 25 to 30 thousand dollars to complete the work. That's what it takes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:18:49.590
Then you had indicated that you want the original materials to be in a library at a Black institution, which I imagine you haven't selected at this particular point in time.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:19:00.320
No. We're speaking with a number of other institutions but we think that's -- from our initial context -- we think that's quite feasible to find, you know, a satisfactory one within a year.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:14.480
And at this institution you'd have to have some type of service, which would monitor the collection, its use, and also disseminate to various other institutions, and individuals, materials about the collection. Because that's really the way in which papers of this type are used. Scholars become aware of the fact that they exist, and they come to use them, and then they talk to other scholars about it, and it moves back and forth. Now as you mentioned earlier, the fact that some of the papers -- in particular some of the films -- are presently not available because they have been -- I don't know whether the confiscated is the right word -- but it's almost that practical effect. They're not available to the public. And you do feel that you're going to be able to get some movement on that?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:20:03.830
Well, that depends on the response of the various -- specifically the State Department, the FBI, the CIA, and the IRS -- to our attorneys trying to extract information under the Freedom of Information Act. For example, there is a document, written by President Truman, forbidding Paul Robeson to cross the borders of the United States -- the continental United States -- issued in 1950, including the instruction to the border personnel to restrain him by any means necessary. There is such a document. It was read to him at the Canadian border. The State Department failed to produce that during the court case for the passport saying they couldn't find it. It exists somewhere and that's a historical document. To my knowledge, no such document has ever been issued on a citizen in the United States in its entire history, if that citizen was not under indictment of some kind. So it's of historical interest. So there are many documents like that. As I say [unintelligible] [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:21:10.661
And those documents I with probably will be more difficult -- if they have not surfaced today -- they'd probably be more difficult to surface than, for example, the films that you suggest have been confiscated or were taken. What were these films that had been taken from newsreel films, or were they feature films, or were they documentaries, or what? Or were they personal film that he had taken himself?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:21:34.610
No. Mostly they are newsreel footage that is missing from many newsreel libraries, that many documentary film people who've tried to find material on Paul Robeson have come up with the cards and no film. That is the film has been taken. Also, much film was shot by people like FBI agents, CIA agents, other people assigned to harass or to surveillance of my father during the period from 1949 to 1958 -- both here and abroad, as a matter of fact -- of which there is evidence in State Department documents and in the correspondence between our attorneys and them. Now, it is a problem of identifying. It is difficult, of course, for me -- and I cannot provide chapter and verse of -- on such and such a date, there were so many feet of film shot by agent so-and-so, of such and such a concert, which is now in the file. So, that we have difficulty in identifying specific pieces of film and so on. But it has been -- certainly from information that I've been able to get myself and from others -- there is significant amounts of film that have -- whether confiscated is the right word or not --have been taken out of circulation through -- directly or indirectly -- through agencies of the United States government.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:22:59.560
And as you describe this process of finding this, it seems to me as though you're going to need a lot of resources beyond traditional research resources to get this. And I would imagine that would involve some legal action in some instances, as well as following up on a variety of leads that you might pick up as you do some of the other investigative work.

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:23:21.020
Right. But I think we'll have a lot of help in that by -- you know -- people in the film media who are interested in unearthing this material. Our main job is actually, not an archives task, but the family task. Only the family can, as you know, request and pursue the Freedom of Information Act.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:23:42.430
What do you -- Have you detected a -- you suggested that there had been some change in climate because of the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Awareness Movement. Have you detected, in the general public eye, a change in terms of an understanding of your father, an understanding of what he stood for, an understanding of how he had been mistreated in several instances?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:24:09.730
Well I think that, certainly in the public eye, there's been a great increase in awareness because much more material has become available. Significant amounts of documentary film have been shown on television and material -- recorded material --has been becoming widely available. So, I think there is a big response of the public in general because, when people see and hear my father -- so to speak -- on tapes, on recording, or in film, their responses is instantaneous and overwhelmingly good. So that the problem does not lie in the public. I think that the established media, ranging from television networks through the august "New York Times," still maintain a politically hostile stance towards my father's legacy and are not about to promote an understanding of the true meaning of that legacy because it conflicts with their own political and economic interests and stands that, still, I believe remains a problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:20.680
Well, I think that in many ways, Paul Robeson is recognized as a great scholar, artist, and so on, but principally as a freedom fighter, as one who had particular political beliefs, which he expounded extremely well and all over the world. On the other hand, Paul Robeson was a significant -- one of the most significant figures -- in the entertainment world of the 20s, 30s, 40s, and even 50s. What kind of response have you gotten from the entertainment industry -- you know -- the recording industry, the theater industry, the film, industry -- in terms of providing material and cooperation?

Paul Robeson Jr. 00:26:03.580
Well, I think the artists themselves have been, as you -- from the wonderful group of artists, who who came from all over the country for the tribute to Paul Robeson: Sidney Poitier, Shirley Knight, Carmen de Lavallade, and so many others, who came. And those who participated in the seventy fifth birthday celebration. "Actors' Equity," who has a Paul Robeson Committee, and who have done outstanding things to make known the legacy of Paul Robeson. To actors and actresses, to the entertainment profession. Many recordings have been released by the major recording companies -- CBS, RCA, Vanguard, Monitor. So that certainly -- he was, several years ago, among the first hundred inductees to the Theater Hall of Fame; his name is among the first hundred inscribed on the wall at the Uris Theater. So, certainly, the entertainment industry has, more and more over the past, I would say, eight years -- since 1970, or 68, or so -- begun to recognize his stature as an artist. I think there, the legacy -- and the important legacy -- that he leaves is the involvement of an artist, and the integrity of an artist, which he is one of the pioneers in saying, well -- as he put it -- "The artist must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice. I have no alternative."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:50.710
