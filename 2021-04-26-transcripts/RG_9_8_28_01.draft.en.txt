Speaker 1 00:00:01.910
This is Soul of reason a program that tells what's happening in black America. Each week on soul of reason leaders and movers of the black community visit NBC to discuss important issues of concern to black New Yorkers. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior adjunct professor of education at New York University and president of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. Our guest tonight is Professor Hollis Lynch who is a well-known political scientist and is very concerned with what's happening in Southern Africa.

Speaker 2 00:00:30.740
Glad to have you with us this evening. There's got to be here. President and I should call you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. In today's news scarcely a day passes that something exciting dramatic doesn't it the press about southern Africa or about South Africa about Rhodesia. Initially the pressure was on Rhodesia and I guess it still is in terms of immediate independence. But more recently because of the killing of Steve Biko and the various disruptions in Soweto and other parts of South Africa itself with the increased emphasis on the part of the United States with Ambassador Andrew Young and some of the positions that President Carter has articulated. People are concerned about what's happening in Southern Africa. And I thought we might begin tonight's discussion by looking at the United Nations that today's United Nations position Visa V South Africa.

Speaker 3 00:01:26.630
Well there's no doubt that most members of the United Nations that is the if you like the Afro Asian block would like to see more stringent measures taken against South Africa to produce if you like a movement towards political democracy. I prefer that phrase of the one of majority rule. As everyone knows who's been reading the newspapers and listening to the news. South Africa recently took additional very very drastic steps against all blacks. There black newspapers have been banned blacks have been held in detention white sympathizers have been similarly treated. There has been an additional policy of of of repression which has called for wide condemnation and has led to the historic U.N. arms embargo. Of course some the third world countries notably the African countries feel that the UN has not gone far enough that economic sanctions should also be taken against South Africa. In other words they see the U.N. embargo as minimal as not really altering the situation.

Speaker 2 00:03:10.130
All right well let's get the difference between those because yes the citizen in the street particularly black citizens says Why do we keep doing business with South Africa at a time when so many people are being oppressed and at a time when human rights are obviously not being granted to them. Why do we keep doing business. What is the difference between an embargo and just a total ending of trade with South Africa.

Speaker 4 00:03:36.590
Yes. Well this embargo applies only to arms.

Speaker 3 00:03:43.430
There are those who feel that there should be a complete economic boycott. This is the only way of bringing now the South African government or forcing changes.

Speaker 5 00:03:54.650
Would that really work. I mean what. Well what type of economic changes would we endure in our own economy and society. I understand that South Africa could provide some uranium and they provide certainly gold diamonds. Well some of the other rare minerals.

Speaker 6 00:04:12.740
This is the crux of the matter. This is the crux of the matter. It is not likely to work precisely because of the enormous investments that the West has in South Africa.

Speaker 7 00:04:24.270
United States has an investment of some one point five billion dollars and in South Africa Britain has an investment of 7 billion dollars 7 billion for 9 Billion Dollars which indicates that the British interest is far greater than yes indeed indeed.

Speaker 8 00:04:40.370
And of course South Africa itself really was formed or became a full blown by the British precisely.

Speaker 6 00:04:47.240
And of course you know that the British economy is now rather tottering one sort of the consequences to Britain would be even more disastrous economically. And this without doubt has been a factor which has led to rather a moderate approach on the part of United States and Western Europe. Not only is there concern through Western investment but as you well pointed out certain uranium and gold for Africa is a major source of that. So it's an extremely difficult situation which has led to this big gap between rhetoric against South Africa and the failure to take any meaning really meaningful steps to alter the situation there.

Speaker 2 00:05:38.350
Well I know that there are some black American leaders such as Franklin Williams the president of helped stoke on both side who believes that some selective economic measures against South Africa would help to establish a climate for change for example United States Corporation which you're investing and doing business in South you can insist on first class accommodations equal equalization of salary provision of opportunities for upward mobility for people who work for the multinational corporations owned by the United controlled by the United States in southern Africa. Yes. To what extent might that bring about a change. To what extent might that just increase the oppression. Because it appears that whenever even the moderates begin to be making some progress then those who opt for the status quo come down even harder.

Speaker 4 00:06:29.260
Well that's correct. All this in fact has been happening. I don't think it will fundamentally alter the situation.

Speaker 3 00:06:35.470
There has been over the years pressures on foreign co-op corporations in South Africa to upgrade are they African workers to use them in more advance positions to close the gap in wages between the Africans and whites.

Speaker 6 00:06:59.170
This has been happening. But this does not really get to the heart of the matter. In fact I expect this kind of process to continue and one might say that it's simply a form of cooperation which might in some sense less than they are the four total independent precisely.

Speaker 7 00:07:19.420
So it's a very difficult question.

Speaker 2 00:07:21.340
All right. But again we're talking now particularly at the level of what we can really do both at a moral level and an economic level obviously at least to us backs. Apartheid is wrong it's morally wrong it's all about and we used to say in the case of segregation in the United States that it was economically debilitating to the society. Well apparently it isn't economically debilitating to the South Africans because it gives them a basis of getting a relatively cheap labor pool. Precisely. So you bring them in control. Yes. What about the the so-called right of eminent domain and what about the fact that allegedly this was the Africans country the black Africans country and that therefore they should have control of it as against the position of the British and the Dutch that they came and they took over an area that really had no people in it and developed it.

Speaker 4 00:08:21.010
How how does one deal with those issues. This is very much an academic question which at a certain level is completely meaningless irrelevant when people are being oppressed.

Speaker 6 00:08:29.440
But the fact is that if we got to look at it in historical terms that the claim of the South Africans that Southern Africa was inhabited is just complete nonsense all of southern Africa was inhabited largely by the Bantu people and the white stuff will have to be seen fundamentally as invaders. But of course this is not uncommon in history. And I nobody. Well most people most South Africans themselves are not suggesting that all the whites should be thrown into the sea. In fact South Africans have been black South Africans that have been consistently sensible and moderate on this issue. All they're asking is for some form of political and economic democracy that if you have a political democracy then there will repression will no longer continue. But there is a there is a there is a role for whites certainly in South Africa.

Speaker 4 00:09:32.920
Of course there are those groups now that are beginning to come into being who feel as a result of this law of oppression that whites should be virtually exterminated altogether but I I I think this is still a minority opinion.

Speaker 2 00:09:45.350
And of course the basic element of racism comes in that is the fear by the white population that a jet black majority is going to rule and is going to call the tune and it becomes really complicated when you look at the sophisticate Haitian of the economy in South Africa.

Speaker 8 00:10:03.050
South Africa I think has one of the three or four best armies in the world in terms of least in the western world. Non communist bloc in terms of its sophisticated equipment. The industry has become totally involved in technology because of the way in which they were run and an apartheid society. It is the whites who have the technical expertise in order to carry out these various activities whereas the labour intensive work is done by blacks. The question is then given the fact that independence or political democracy is desirable could in fact the South African nation controlled by the majority of blacks allowing for a certain exodus of whites continue the economy at the level that it is or is it necessary for it to be continued at that level because it appears that in one sense when you say there's one point five billion dollars investment for the United States and seven billion in Britain and I'm sure several billion from other places including Israel and Germany it raises the question as to whether South Africa is really being in a sense the mineral breadbasket for the rest of the Western world or whether it's really necessary for themselves so how do you put those things together as a political scientist looking toward the day when eventually political democracy will come to Southern. Yes.

Speaker 7 00:11:31.970
I don't know if I can correct you slightly I'm really a historian but I don't suppose it really matters.

Speaker 6 00:11:36.830
I don't think that there'd be any problem. Let me say this in blacks controlling the economy in South Africa should should political democracy come into being. But one thing are most of the whites are likely to stay because they have of course deep roots there and deep economic interest there. Don't forget we have examples of situations in which political power has been transferred from colonial whites to blacks and whites have managed to stay on.

Speaker 4 00:12:12.380
And in fact I'm pleased in English improved positions indeed play an extraordinary role in economic terms. We see this happening in Kenya the Ivory Coast and other African countries. So I don't think that sort of goes much too attractive a country. And I do feel that should the point arise where the pressure on white South Africans are so great that whilst there will be something of an exodus there'll be those who will leave.

Speaker 9 00:12:40.010
But it is very likely that the vast majority of the 4 million will stay on and accommodate themselves quite nicely to a new black regime because of the attractiveness in every sense and sense of climate and the sense of its economic potential. So that a new predominantly black regime will have the support of most of the whites.

Speaker 4 00:13:09.490
You know it's amazing it's amazing people's ability to accommodate in the final analysis to the realities of power. I can well understand of course that the whites will not want particularly the Africa otherwise will not want to give up power very easily. And there can be no doubt at all about it that it will fight very very strenuously but wants desperately to maintain that power.

Speaker 2 00:13:33.590
But once they've been pushed right up against the wall I think we might be surprised to see what a dramatic turnaround in terms of behavior can take place because that analysis that you've just provided adds credence to the economic boycott theory that if in fact the country was forced to endure six months to 18 months of severe economic deprivation it might accelerate the attitudes and the moves on the part of some of the whites to say let's sit down at the table and do business and it would also accelerate. I'm sure the pressure of guerrilla warfare and others which would be another means toward moving people closer to a resolution. If that's the case why is it that the rest of the Western world the United States Britain France are really just giving token condemnation to South Africa in terms of arms embargo instead of trying for six months or eight months yeah a total economic boycott is that they are afraid of the impact on their own economy was not only I think this is a factor.

Speaker 4 00:14:43.900
This is definitely a factor the fear of the economic losses that was sustain but I think there's a realization that we should not kid ourselves about this this is going to take many more than six months to bring down the South African and I'm sure it is confusing and that is the problem this should mean sustained boycott over many many years.

Speaker 9 00:15:06.750
I don't think an economic boycott can do it alone. I'm not saying that it should not be attempted but not an economic boycott.

Speaker 6 00:15:15.940
Plus insurrection from from within. Plus perhaps even an economic boycott inside in terms of strikes withholding services withholding services from within might bring about what is likely to happen in my view.

Speaker 10 00:15:37.270
In the first instance is that the white regime is likely to make certain concessions concessions to certain groups within the society as a means of staving off perhaps quite realistically.

Speaker 9 00:15:52.520
This sounds gloomy for some decades. What you might call the black capes used to find a solution but I mean namely what it was mostly inevitable so the inevitable solution here that most blacks and other enlightened people like to see them political democracy. There is a plan you might have heard of it. For instance the possibility of giving the franchise to the Collins.

Speaker 7 00:16:21.790
This this plan has actually been discussed and of course that's very divisive because absolutely.

Speaker 2 00:16:26.870
But the colors against the blacks and for the audience Collins are those people of Indian and Asian descent and mixed blood mixed yet who become sort of the buffer between the Caucasians white and about four millions that the collards are more than 3 million there.

Speaker 9 00:16:45.610
There is a very substantial group and we are likely to see measures like these taken before the South Africans would agree to complete democracy in South Africa again.

Speaker 2 00:17:00.550
What do you think would be the impact of an economic boycott of South Africa on Western economy. Do you think it would really make any difference. One of the arguments of some of the people making against that is that it would it would throw western economy which is already right on the brink into total chaos.

Speaker 7 00:17:18.579.9999999998836
I don't I don't even know.

Speaker 9 00:17:19.630.0000000001164
I tend not all agree but I do know that the one point five billion U.S. investment in inside Africa represents probably less than 1 percent of U.S. investment overseas and as has been pointed out by other analysts U.S. has greater investments now in in black South Africa completely black. I mean black Africa. That is Africa. Other than than South Africa than in South Africa itself. Ah. It is true though it's likely to have something of an impact much greater impact on Britain and on the United States. It would it would not matter considerably for the United States economy as a whole. I mean certain corporations might be affected in minimal ways. But I don't really buy that argument nor do I buy the argument that it would affect greatly black South Africans themselves.

Speaker 7 00:18:18.310
In fact because they benefit the least economically from the system they have very little to lose.

Speaker 10 00:18:23.980
It is the whites obviously who White told Africans who would most likely be affected by this.

Speaker 1 00:18:33.260
Tonight on solar reason we are talking with Professor Hollis Lenz who is a historian and is very active and interested in the political movements in southern Africa.

Speaker 2 00:18:41.980
And we have pointed out very clearly the fact that this is an issue which everyone is devoting considerable attention to a couple other things I wanted to ask you about Harley's relationship to these various positions and that is the argument that the United States in particular cannot take stronger positions against South Africa because of the fear that they would be attracted to the Communist bloc. What do you think the validity of that argument is.

Speaker 11 00:19:12.130
I think that that has no validity at all. This is the sort of propaganda that that's that's simply a silly statement.

Speaker 4 00:19:28.060
It's an excuse for taking a forthright stand on the issue. There's no way that. When you say South Africans you mean they are white or black South Africans black South Africans No.

Speaker 2 00:19:37.960
South Africa is a nation really well.

Speaker 4 00:19:40.280
Whether that is that is certainly not the case.

Speaker 12 00:19:42.070
I mean in South Africa and white South Africans see themselves as an anti-Communist bastion in Africa and the blacks as we're discovering the more pragmatic than we have allowed. That's one of the things that they look what has happened for instance in and in Somalia. You say ah this notion. Let me make this comment. The notion that when African nations accept aid and support from the Soviet Union it means that they become puppets of the Soviet Union is just so much nonsense.

Speaker 9 00:20:17.560
I think the recent history in Africa has shown this to be unfounded in view Africans are pragmatists like most humans. Like like like most nations most people and they will take aid. Well and even when they might be sympathetic in ideological terms it doesn't mean that they're less concerned about their own independence. So that argument simply I would say does not hold water.

Speaker 2 00:20:43.610
There is a certain amount of racism inherent in those kind of arguments which suggests that blacks do not have the intelligence and the sense of history and the awareness to be able to make decisions on their own behalf. It goes back to the old paternalistic absolute colonialist ex that theory of dealing with black people not only in Africa but throughout the world. Now speaking of black people we think you've presented an excellent analysis of the situation what you think even the long range might be. What can United States blacks do in order to accelerate the move toward political democracy toward equality toward independence self governance in South Africa and Zimbabwe in Namibia and so on and particularly the model it's frequently used. Which isn't totally well drawn is the model that has to do with the American Jewish support of Israel and the tremendous amount of activity political and economic activity and support and the relatively pathetic activity in the United States.

Speaker 13 00:21:49.790
I think recently coming out of a country Congressional Black Caucus meeting in 1977 they form the United States. I think it's called Black American Coalition for Africa which Franklin Williams and some of the other black leaders are actively involved in they're trying to raise some money for it and so on. I think they call it the coalition. Well what do you think the concerns of black Americans are. Visa V Southern Africa. Why are they not more active. What can they do if they become more active.

Speaker 10 00:22:26.540
Well my impression is that there is very widespread concern on the part of black Americans about what's happening in Southern Africa. The problem has been so far as I see it inability to channel this concern effectively and to put the kind of sustained pressure on Congress and the president to take a firmer more decisive stance with regard to South Africa.

Speaker 9 00:23:00.320
I think that the coalition that you speak about that Franklin Williams heads is an idea in the right direction but it has not been able to make a public impact. My my impression is that it's perhaps more a paper organization than a really effective assertive organization. What we need. Let me make this clear. My view is an umbrella organization because the point is that are all black Americans are agreed on this.

Speaker 4 00:23:32.150
And what we need is the mechanism to express all deep feelings about this. In political terms.

Speaker 2 00:23:41.180
Well we do have some problems even some major differences. Let's say together with the American Jewish community for example the Jewish community in terms of economic position is strong enough to be able to exert pressure either through personal contacts or through economic pressure on certain aspects of society and particularly Israel which is a small country is a much much smaller geographically it's an entity it can be isolated can we focus and when we talk about a coalition on Africa we're talking about literally dozens of millions of people in many many different kinds of countries and not having the individual economic power located in a few blacks. We then have to use the sort of collective power. And the problem that many blacks have talked about is we've got to get things together here and deal with the 14 percent unemployment among blacks and the 50 percent unemployment among black youth and let's get ourselves together politically to deal with that. And rather than putting so much of our energies over into southern Africa. So it looks to me as though in some instances this becomes sort of an esoteric exercise for some black intellectuals. And I think that we have a gap there between the mass of black America and that's true and the so-called intellectual segment of black America.

Speaker 4 00:25:05.540
I don't see the questioners as one against the other. A question of putting all our energies here and leaving. I think both can be done and I see the process as complementary.

Speaker 12 00:25:16.460
I would I would concur but I'm talking about the way the person in the streets attempts to talk about this as a spark the question of education and I really do believe that we haven't done nearly as much share to maximize all potential or potential here given the fact of relative economic weakness although we are relatively economic weak we have not done nearly as much as we can. I used to Jack surmise all potential. Let me just develop this. It is true that black Africa is is very. Africa is a very large continent. But if we are if we are united as a people we can focus our attention on any particular issue at a time. For instance if we feel that the most crucial issue is southern Africa then we focus on that we exert off or pressure political pressure. Whatever pressures we can bring to bear on that on that question you see so does the size of Africa. It seems to me does not diminish our responsibility.

Speaker 2 00:26:19.100
You're right you're right. Yet our history doesn't seem to bear out too well in at one time it was his suggestion I remember some posters to boycott golf because of its involvement in Mozambique and Angola.

Speaker 8 00:26:32.210
That didn't get very far. They did have some nice posters and they had a few demonstration but it didn't really get very far. One of the problems that many people have brought up about economic boycotts is that particularly given the multinational nature of several of our large corporations it is really difficult to totally boycott a given country because they may have invested five million dollars in Africa with it.

Speaker 14 00:26:58.250
I remember some years ago we were trying to work out what organisation I was with not to invest in a bank that had investments in South Africa so that when you finally ended up checking a portfolio everyone had some there.

Speaker 2 00:27:09.260
So that tends to suggest that that type of approach has more of a symbolic value than a real value.

Speaker 9 00:27:17.330
But in one area it seems to me in one area namely the area of political lobbying we have not done we have done right. None of them as much as we could and that's an area that is not beset set the kinds of problems that an economic boycott has. Does that I mean I have occasionally talked to people at the State Department and Congress people and so on and they say we never hear from you. You hope people about African issues. Other groups have tended to be much better organized here. We have simply neglected what has been a traditional American channel for expressing our deep feelings because I don't think it's a lack of deep feelings and concern about Africa. We simply have not been able to channel those concerns and feelings effectively.

Speaker 2 00:28:07.730
I think you've particularly that very well as matter of fact one of the major purposes of this coalition is to accelerate the lobbying. Seems to me that some of the most effective lobbying has been done by people like Andrew Young in terms of his outspoken position Lester and Arthur Ashe B because of his prominence as a sports figure. Apparently there does seem to be more need to enlist some of the more visible black Americans in this.

Speaker 4 00:28:32.960
Yes but we need to institutionalize it as well.

Speaker 12 00:28:35.370
It's all right for these individuals to do their thing and able to attract public attention but we need to have some kind of organization that is concerned about that and as an organization that is known to be supported by all major black organizations like the NAACP National Urban League and so on and so forth. We need an organization that rich that is known to be supported by all the major organization because it seems to me this is an issue that we are all in agreement we want freedom for blacks in Southern Africa. No. No one would quarrel with that. So that whatever differences there are among these organizations we ought to come together on this question and act more effectively.

Speaker 1 00:29:23.090
Our guest on tonight solid reason has been Professor Hollis Lynch African historian and political scientist at Columbia University and we've been talking about the United States position and black America's position on the conditions in southern Africa. This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for soul of reason. This program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with NBC.
