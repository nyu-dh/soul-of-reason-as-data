Jack Johnson, Joe Lewis, Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Ralph Metcalf, Jesse Owens, Arthur Ashe. What do these men have in common? They have all helped to make sports a major part of Black life in America. Hear Allan Barron, publisher of "Black Sports Magazine" discussed the meaning of sports to the Black community on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:45.151
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:01:12.210
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Allan Barron who is publisher of "Black Sports Magazine", a magazine which focuses on the role of Blacks in America and world sport. And as we said on the tease, Allan sports are such a major part of the Black experience. I was wondering as a publisher and as a writer about Black sports if you can give our audience some idea as to why you think sports is such an important part of the Black experience.

Allan Barron 00:01:40.560
Well I think that it is basically a cultural experience. Blacks have traditionally utilized sports as a thin entering wedge to break into the major subset of the system. And I think that we could talk just a few short minutes about antebellum slavery days, when blacks were pitted against one another in a boxing format in what they called the "circle square," and that's the ring that was drawn in the dirt on the plantation. And rich slave owners would take and pit their "big slave" against their fellow slave owners "big slave" and it got to be a way of life for the slave because the guy who could fight best, he was not allowed to work into the field. He was brought up to be a sort of a yard nigger, he worked around the around the yard taking care of the horses as opposed to being out there in the sun because he got to be a favorite pastime. And when I think Billy what I believe happened is that the Black soon learned that there was a means to an end through this facility of sports and that thing moved from boxing to horse racing, where traditionally all of the jockeys who won the first big races were Blacks. Men of means never sat the back of a horse. I mean that was just something you didn't do, you owned horses it was a pastime, but you never climbed up on the back and rode that thing down toward the finish line.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:01.921
You had your slave to do it initially and then later on when Blacks were free --if freedom in the south was freedom-- they were actually hired. And as we know that probably the most famous Black job jockey is the legendary Isaac Murphy.

Allan Barron 00:03:16.684
Absolutely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:03:17.911
Who rode more Kentucky Derby winners and anybody who's ever ridden I believe. But I think your point is well taken about how the roots of sport in America and particularly go into Black life right from slavery. Right from the plantation particularly boxing and horse racing and then as we've moved into the more modern sports, every sport that Blacks have touched they have managed to gain ascendancy. And I think it refers to baseball and refers to firstly, it refers to track and field with the great Black sprinters to the point where they were looking for the White hope to beat men like Ralph Metcalf and Jesse Owens. And then it moved into baseball, it's moved into basketball, and now moving into football. And with the ascendancy of Arthur Ashe and the fact that after the Ashe's fantastic victory at Wimbledon, you're going to find Black youth all over the country picking up tennis rackets. In my opinion, there's no doubt that Blacks will be in the forefront of American tennis players.

Allan Barron 00:04:22.830
Well I think that you know when you take a look at people who are trying to bridge an economic gap and when you have some physical ability and it doesn't require anything above physical ability just some dedication of time and energy, which every one of us has, you suddenly see how Blacks can come to or minorities can come to preeminence in the sport. For basketball, greatness you need a basketball and a hoop and you really don't need 96 feet of solid wood floor with lines like. You need a broken down courtyard like you find around most of the inner city in urban areas across the country.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:04:53.820
Of course, one of the things that I write about and speak about is the fact that in some ways I feel that sports are overemphasized, particularly in the Black schools in that sense is a myth that sports represent a pattern of economic mobility for most people. The few people who get the million dollar contracts, the few Moses Malones and the few Kareem Abdul Jabbars is and so on are really one thousands of one percent. And then when you multiply the literally hundreds of thousands of Black youth are spending dozens and dozens and dozens of hours a week on basketball courts and track and field fields and things of this type you wonder what this is doing in terms of the Black youth of America. Particularly since we need so many people who might be accountants and scientists and politicians and teachers and so on. I think that I know in "Black Sports" you've written about this but what are some of your thoughts on it today.

Allan Barron 00:05:56.420
Or Roscoe you and I will never differ that opinion because that's the reason Black sports came into existence because we believe that sports is out of control in our society and even getting more so. Specifically in our community because we have kids who all they want to do is learn the bounds of basketball and not interested in reading and they don't know the fact that sports careers are very short term. The average life expectancy in terms of careers in the NFL is examples three years. In basketball, it's something like six years. So you're taking a terrible risk when you totally centralize all of your living experience and by trying to be a professional athlete. In addition to the fact that, as an example, there thirty five hundred colleges and universities in America - and at least half of them field ten men on the basketball team. So you've got a tremendous odds against you when you think that they're only 17 teams in the NBA drafting about three guys each every season. So your ability to make it as a professional is very minuscule at best. We believe that sports like any other thing is a healthy adjunct to life. We also believe that in a lot of cases it can be a stepping stone to other things. As a result of that philosophy, we do a thing called "The Man" and one called "TCB" an anachronism for "taking care of business" in our magazine where we talk about great Black athletes who have used their facility for physicalness to become the head of some program to pursue their doctoral degrees to really immerse themselves in American system as opposed to just trying to be an entertainer for the system in itself.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:07:30.701
I think that's quite significant as matter of fact as you're talking about your magazine "Black Sports" which we'll talk about later more detail. I was thinking that for Black youth to read it's important that they read things that are of interest to them. Sports are of interest to them. So not only are you serving a function in terms of helping to teach them about the world of sports, you're also helping teach them to read because the magazine is well-written and it does cover a whole range of topics. And I've noticed in more recent issues you've gotten into things like gymnastics and lacrosse, things that Blacks generally have not been particularly well known for, although occasionally we have had champions in those various areas. So in that sense I think your magazine does preform a particular function. On the other hand, I'm sure you've had people ask you "Why do you really need a magazine in Black sports?" since whenever you picked up "Sport Magazine," "Sports Illustrated," "Newsweek," "Time," and you name it if there is a sports cover, it's going to be at least 50-50 a Black person and there's a tremendous discussion about sports. So why don't you tell our audience both why you conceptualize the magazine "Black Sports" and why you think there's a need for it and finally how successful has it been?

Allan Barron 00:08:53.440
Well I'd like to answer me a little bit in reverse.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:08:55.521
I'm sure you will.

Allan Barron 00:08:57.472
We're absolutely successful. We feel really encouraged by the fact that on a monthly basis we are now selling 300,000 single copies, which makes us a good sized magazine in terms of the American marketplace. But the whole concept of this magazine and the reasons for it are very obvious. Here in 1975, we are probably 1 of 10 monthly publications going to an audience of approximate 23 and maybe 30 million people.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:24.511
You talk about the Black parties.

Allan Barron 00:09:25.271
I'm talking about the black community.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:26.621
You talking about magazines like "Ebony" and "Essence" and "Encore" and "Black Enterprise."

Allan Barron 00:09:31.871
Correct.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:09:32.252
And this type and you fall into that particular "grouping" as you say of magazine.

Allan Barron 00:09:36.941
As they are called "specialty magazines" a specialty audience magazines. When you talk about the Black male and his need to identify and to know who he is and what he is. We're just the only magazine that's out there. There's a very definite psychological truism that I'm sure you're you're completely aware of that is that you are what you perceive yourself to be. Now for Black men, we ain't nothing because we've never been able to perceive ourselves in terms of the written word in terms of magazine projections. There's just never been this kind of an image you know for Black Americans. So the "Black Sports Magazine's" purpose is not only to inform people entertain them but it's to present a kind of image of Black America that's never been seen. So while there's a proliferation of White views of sports, our contention is that White America has always created "our heroes" and it's time for us to create our own heroes, not the "Black Sports" wants to do that but we want to present you with some behind the scenes kinds of data a different perspective. When I talk with Chamberlain, as an example, it's on a very low-key kind of a basis where he is very real the language is a little bit different and he is not trying to say to me it was a great game. West did this and I did that and as a team we won. He may say "man he's a sorry dude and I don't like playing with him" don't quote me on this but whatever it may be. And then we'll arrange the story so that he has a chance to really use "Black Sports" as a forum as a platform for his lifestyle for his concepts which other sports magazines don't give the Black athlete. They give him the sports page kinds of projection and we think our audience deserves more than that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:11:13.120
That is true about many sports magazines that they are more or less reportorial magazines rather than analytical magazines. I find in reading "Black Sports" that your articles about unknown or lesser known athletes appeal to me far more than your articles about the ones I have read about. And I think part of that is that it does provide an opportunity for me to empathize to understand the life space of the typical Black athlete rather than just the superstar. Also, I find that in your specialty columns like "The Man" and "TCB" it gives me an opportunity in a sense to test my opinions against the opinions of other people who are right out there in the world of sport. So in that sense I think you've done certainly a service plus your high school athlete and your college athlete of the month digging down into those Black high schools or sometimes white high schools where Black athletes are doing some outstanding things. So I feel very very positive about that particular part of it. I'd like you to mention a new magazine that you are conceptualizing which also deals with Black youth but not in the field of sports. Could you tell us about that new magazine?

Allan Barron 00:12:31.910
We're really really high on on a project that we've called "Discovery Magazine" and we've used the term "Discovery" because of a twofold purpose. One is that Black college youth which is the orientation and the direct slant for this editorial package are discovering themselves and discovering the American system, which we are hoping to really be involved with helping them do. And the second is that advertisers are just beginning to discover the Black American economy. So that "Discovery Magazine" is a very unique experience. We call it a "cultural experience" for the Black college student, wherever he may be. If he's on that White college campus he's in limbo. If he's on that Black college campus he's in an unreal environment cause the world isn't Black the world is homogeneous mixture of all sorts of peoples. And so what this magazine does is an Inter Collegiate communications facility. We have data from Jackson State going to students who are at Michigan State and the vice versa. Students Black students for the first time are having the ability to know what other Black students are doing what problems they're facing, where their heads are, what their opinions are. We've also made sure the book is a very light, informative journal so that we're not trying to be a sociopolitical book at all. What we're trying to is entertain the heck out of these Black college students while keeping their perspective on Blackness at its zenith during these very critical years of their college education.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:13:53.350
I think that's very important because humor is an important part of any struggle. And as we know from the many Black comedians and many Black entertainers that humor has always been a part of our life. It's been a part of our life in the world of sport as well which is the reason why many of the sports stories that we deal with stories that deal with the humor that comes out of the Black experience. I know that you've been very interested in the activities to honor Black athletes. Could you tell us about that very briefly?

Allan Barron 00:14:24.160
We started the National Black Sports Hall of Fame about two years ago and we are currently involved with a building that is being constructed in Washington D.C. which will be the shrine to house all the artifacts to the great great Black athletes in the past, the present, and the future.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:14:41.861
We're talking this evening with Allan Barron: who's Publisher of "Black Sports Magazine." And Allan I know in your travels through the world of sports particularly from the point of view of the Black athlete. You must have had some opportunity to observe how conditions have changed for Black athletes even during the short four or five years during which you've published "Black Sports Magazine."

Allan Barron 00:15:04.770
Oh absolutely! I think that the change has been dramatic in terms of not only just the physical conditions that athletes are now enjoying but the particular kinds of status that they're also enjoying. The largest heroes the greatest sports heroes in America today are the Black athletes. When you get off a plane in Des Moines, Iowa and Walt Frazier is on a layover there and you see these thousands of young White kids as a corn crop belt or the wheat belt waiting to get a chance to glimpse the great Walt Frazier you're beginning to understand the kinds of significance the sport has in our country. And then again when you sit and talk as I had an opportunity to do with Mr. Robinson is Jackie Robinson just before his untimely death and you listen to the kinds of problems that he endured as he was trying to become the first Black to play in baseball. And you look at the way the Walt Frazier and I don't use Walt's name as any kind of a special case but just using him as an example the kind of prestige and facilities that today's Black athlete has. The change has been absolutely dramatic sense and since that time period.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:16:14.701
Well the thing that I was concerned about as I asked the question was whether the social conditions that Black athletes face have changed. There has been and I would say still is a considerable amount of discrimination not so much of an overt nature but of a subtle nature. Things like can 10 Blacks room with Whites on teams, things like can they assume positions of leadership on teams, can they assume positions of leadership in unions, can they be captains of teams. This is the type of thing I was talking about because certainly the more overt things such as Jackie was talking about in terms of discrimination in hotels things of that type has diminished or almost completely evaporated except in certain parts of the South. But I was referring expressly to the social conditions that Black athletes have to face. And as a Publisher and as one who knows a number of Black athletes I think you could probably put a pretty good thing on that pulse.

Allan Barron 00:17:21.480
Let me just say one thing I understand your question little bit more clearly. Let me say that the first is a misnomer that most of us labor on and that is a sports is a cornucopia of life and that is some kind of utopian experience. I think that what sports really is is a microcosm of the total system and because it is a microcosm we have the ability under a microscope a microscopic eye of the journalistic pen to really take a good close look at it. So as an example, racism in sports exists because there's racism in America, drugs in sports exist because there's drugs in America. And you now in light of that, you're absolutely correct Roscoe the Black athletes still suffers a tremendous amount of pressure in terms of social conditions. Just take for example the fact that the outgoing commissioner of the NBA chose to designate as his successor a Black man and the owners of the team chose not to accept him. Now I mean that's a very unique situation when you talk about the bulk of the superstars in professional basketball today being Black athletes. And who can cope better with them I'd like to think than a guy who is a Black, who is an intelligent educated man, who has already proven his worth of dealing with White America, in a business vein, but he can now deal with his superstar which is what that commissioner really has to deal with. These kind of eccentric group of guys who make a million dollars and make all sorts of crazy demands. I think that the microcosm of sports is reflecting a very deep-seated problem that America has and that is that its racism goes far beyond what we used to think. What I personally think was just an economic institution. It goes really much deeper than that and somehow we are going to have to, on a much greater scale, not in my generation or your generation but with our children's children begin to try and ferret out some of the reasons and the realities that that exist about racism in America.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:19:14.941
On "Soul of Reason", we interview guests from a wide spectrum of fields. We have psychologists and we have physicians and we have writers and poets and musicians educators sports figures etc.. And one of the things that comes through is that in every facet of American life, there is an extremely, deeply embedded stream of racism that is unfair treatment characterized by the fact that people are Black. To me this is not a surprise although I think for everyone--subsequent to the "Kerner Report"--possibly other than people like Kenneth Clark and Gunnar Myrdal "An American Dilemma", maybe even people like Malcolm X. We didn't realize the depth with which racism had penetrated the basic fabric of society. On the other hand, having been an athlete myself and having been on fields with a variety of types of athletes, I must admit that I was not surprised at the way in which the White athletes have treated many Black athletes and White owners and coaches treat them. Because it is this mentality that the Black has a superior body and somehow or another he can do these things but he can't think too well. And so as a Black, when you begin to think as you begin to take positions of leadership many whites in the past, and I would say even today, take a somewhat hostile position in this. So when Jackie Robinson first went into baseball and he was a nice guy and he was quiet and he let people cuss him out and call him all kind of names, he was a great person to many writers. When Jackie finally allowed the real personality of Jackie to come through which was to call it where it was whether it was against a White or a Black or an umpire or a teammate or what have you, he became troublesome. He became cocky became someone who wasn't really the type of person you'd want to be a leader. Yet when a White person, a person like Eddis Nike for example became a baseball manager did the same thing. He showed great sophistication and great leadership capacity characteristics so that I do believe you know possibly contrary to some of your feelings that racism is very deeply embedded in sports. It's very deeply embedded in society and since sports a part of society it affects sports. The thing that I'm interested in I think you've written about in the magazine or some of your writers have written about it is the extent to which certain things are happening to change this. For example, John Mackey led the football players strike some years ago a Black man. I think a Black man heads the basketball players association now. We are beginning to see some breakthroughs on this. We're beginning to see situations where Brooklyn basketball a White person such as Rick Barry can be a minority on a predominately Black team and still rise to some type of recognition yet at the same time be aware of the fact that he is a minority. So I think that there are some changes in that direction. I don't think those changes move up into the executive suites. I think that your description would the psychology and the presidency of the NBA as an example of this. I think the absence of managers in big league baseball is certainly an example of this. And we can carry this on so well I might ask you a direct question. As a Publisher of a "Black Sports Magazine", what are you doing through your magazine to help change this particular situation?

Allan Barron 00:22:50.500
Well we personally take the position that our magazine should speak out as strongly as is possible in favor of equal treatment for Blacks. But I would also want to counter that and say that I am not as concerned about on the field activities as I am concerned about something that I think is much larger and that's off the field. When in the world everyone looks at baseball and wants to throw all the stones. What about football? Football has the same stinking problem that baseball has and that's is overt racism there no head Black football coaches and yet Black football colleges are turning out ballplayers that come out of college and start in professional ranks. And yet when I think about hiring a head football coach or general manager they never look for Black anyplace. So I'm not willing to just well I don't want to castigate any one sport. I want to say that I see a tremendous opportunity here the militancy that Blacks assume that I don't ever think that the Black can be militant. He's always just demanding what the rest of the nation sort of gets. But the militancy that the Black society assumed several years ago, has carried over into sports and that same leadership qualities that same swaggering kind of braggadocio character who was walking around in the street saying I don't give a damn about what White folks think when it's when the streets were burning in 66. He's now an athlete. The John Carlos to Tommie Smith the kind of guys are saying to white established sports people that you've got to act right. And we as a magazine feel that we should be a forum for that kind of intelligent presentation of values and changes. We are working right now with Wally Jones and the "Concerned Black Athletes Organization". Wally is a I think a classic case his image was maligned his character was slandered they said he was transporting dope back and forth between teams and he has conclusive evidence that he was not and he has a tremendous lawsuit against the Milwaukee Bucks and the NBA. We're giving Wally a platform and we're working with him because we believe that the guy is a model guy. I mean he has really been an outstanding young Black man in terms of working with youth gangs in Philadelphia and in the Virginia area. So that "Black Sports Magazine" takes a very strong position about Tom Paine and the reason that Tom Paine is in prison down in Atlanta, Georgia and has never even been on the street on bail. A guy who had eight hundred thousand dollars in his pocket and is accused of raping 44 and 46 year old White women and is doing 15 years and has 6 more charges against him. Why? No one's even raised a question the Atlanta Hawks don't want to discuss the problem. So we feel that the changes that we recognize that you're actually correct there aren't changes that are being manifest but we think that there are much larger problems that no other media will even touch. And that we as a magazine must begin to take issue with and to raise intelligent questions so that our readers want to say you know "Where is the answer?". Not that we're given the answer but we're given the facts so that people can draw their own opinions.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:25:38.501
What about the reaction of some people that say that as your major sports become predominantly Black. That they'll become less popular that the gay two seats will fall off that they'll just go back into the dark ages literally and figuratively. What about that. What's your position on that? Have you written about that? Have you had some articles done on that? Because I think as basketball moves upwards of 80 percent and baseball moves up with a 50 percent football likewise that a number of people have severe racist connotations or feelings will continue to say that we've got to shut the door because they'll take over.

Allan Barron 00:26:18.001
Those people make America go round every day. And I think that we did an article that really expressed our feelings and that we did a thing called "Rick Barry House Hunky" because we proved and the San Francisco Warriors have proved a team with courage and conviction. They had a Black coach, they had 10 out of 12 ballplayers were Black, the team captain was White and those guys had as much cohesion as they had to go out and play sandlot basketball and win the NBA championship. I think that's indicative of the kinds of things that can happen if things are approached intelligently. Now, that isn't going to happen they used to say if you put a Black at the quarterback spot you couldn't win. Pittsburgh got really asinine this year, they had a Black quarterback out there. Joe Gilliam who was winning games for them, won the entire pre-season, won the first seven games of the season. They ran a poll in the Press saying "Which quarterback do you want?" and the White populace to fill it up. Pittsburgh said "we want one that Bradshaw" and they put him back at the helm of the ship. There was no other reason than racism there is xenophobia there fear of the unknown. They didn't know how their constituency was going to react and so they reacted in traditional White racist attitude. It's a lot of hogwash to be very blunt about it. If the team is winning, if the team is doing the kind of things that the constituency of the team once, they gonna come out to see the ballplayers. The New York Knicks I think are a classic example. Blacks comprise the audience in "The Garden" of 19,000 maybe 10 percent Roscoe. Maybe 10 percent with the high price of the ducats. And yet, when Walt Frazier or Monroe falls to the floor 19,000 fans swoon and it's not because they're all Black or they're all they against Black.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. 00:27:58.620
I think that's a good point and I think in that little discussion you've shown why it's important that a man like Allan Barron, Head a magazine like "Black Sports". I think also you've helped us to see the real importance of having a magazine dealing with the Black athlete and his role in sports published by a Black person. I'd like to thank you Allan Barron: Publisher of "Black Sports Magazine" for being a guest on "Soul of Reason" and to wish you good luck with your new magazine "Discovery" which is going to deal with a Black college student. Thanks again very much.

Allan Barron 00:28:30.330
Thank you Roscoe.
