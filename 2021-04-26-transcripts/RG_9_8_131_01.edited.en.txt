Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:21.770
This is " Soul of Reason", a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:00:48.980
The recent economic crisis has had almost catastrophic effects on the Black community and has caused a serious increase in mental health problems in New York City. Tonight on Soul of Reason Dr. June Jackson Christmas, Commissioner of Mental Health Services in New York City, will be talking with us about the various programs to alleviate some of these mental health problems here in New York. And June it's really nice having you with us tonight.

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:01:13.661
It's good to be back on the program.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:15.471
I understand that you've been to NBC recently on another one of their community service programs.

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:01:21.410
Yes, I think it's important that people get an idea of what is going on in mental health and alcoholism services. I'm glad that we have programs such as yours and other NBC programs to help educate the public. You know there's so much stigma attached to being mentally ill or having an alcoholism problem that the more that we can all do to educate people I think better we'll be.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:41.001
One of the things that I know just in talking with you personally and I guess the audience knows about reading about what you've said in the press and on the air is that the New York City's mental health program has really been crippled in a sense by some of the financial exigencies that the city has faced. How are you coming along now?

Dr. June Jackson ChristmasSpeaker 6 00:02:02.540
Well crippled is perhaps still a slight exaggeration

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:05.961
but I think you used it once on the media

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:02:06.418
if you look at what's on the media it's hardly alive. It's hobbling along. I think that the cuts of a third of the budget,a third of the City amount of money that City put in, has made it if not crippled is certainly lame The heart of services are they are we know that if any New Yorker is ill, severely mentally ill there are still inpatient services everywhere in the city that one could go to in one's neighborhood. Most of the City if people have an alcoholism problem however the advances that we'd begun to make over the last few years have been slowed down. In other words you might have to go farther if you lived in the Bronx and have a severe drinking problem, might have to go farther to get a program that would serve your needs. In other words we haven't been able to keep pace with what we'd started off doing three or four years ago. Programs have become shrunken a bit. Most of the preventive activities that we'd begun to carry out: family life education, rap sessions with young people about drugs and drug abuse, all of these have had to be cut down on. So now we can help you when you're severely ill but that's not what I want. I want people to be able to be helped earlier in the problems and to be helped even through preventive services and those really have been crippled.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:19.580
I know from your previous appearances on "Soul of Reason" and also in various conferences we've attended that one of the major foci of your professional career has been to work with preventive services, that if you can identify an incipient mental health problem and the conditions that are related to it beforehand this certainly will help us to alleviate the need for mental hospitals in some of the more serious type of treatment is necessary. Now you talked about inpatient services and outpatient services as well. One of the things I'm always confused about and you usually correct me about is the relationship between City mental health and State mental health. And I guess that's largely because in New York City does have its own bureaucracies and many units of government. Now what really is that so that we know and can get that straigthtened out?

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:04:10.220
I'm sure there are plenty of people who are concerned and confused sometimes when we read the latest problem in the newspaper about Willowbrook, which is a State institution for the retarded, or recently this summer concerns about problems in the Bronx State institution, the Psychiatric Center. I will meet friends or colleagues even who raise questions with me about why aren't you doing something. How could you let the situation in the Bronx State Hospital go on? Well New York City and New York State are unfortunate and they in that they have two separate systems. We have one for which our department has responsibility of local mental health, mental retardation and alcoholism services and then we have a large system that's run by the State. Those are the State system, other State schools, the State hospitals, here in New York, they are the Manhattan State or the Bronx Psychiatric Center or Willowbrook. Those are the ones that are run by the State. And they really don't come under my supervision. There are thousands of patients being served in those institutions mainly inpatient and mainly with very very severe mental problems: retardation. mental illness. Then there are some 200 programs which I do have responsibility. Those are programs that are in the public schools and of the Bureau of Child Guidance. They are in all of our neighborhood clinics and programs, Wiltwyck School, Northside in Harlem the Bedford Stuyvesant alcoholism program the Jewish Board of Guardians programs throughout the city and in all the municipal hospitals. Those are programs that are more the community mental health than near their planned to be in neighborhoods. They generally have community advisory boards they have for the last three or four years worked very actively with our department in making sure that they really represent what an inner city community needs and what a newly arrival, a new arrival from China need. They are a little more responsive I believe toward average citizens and toward what they need than the state system has been. My hope is to bring the two together so people don't have to worry about whether or not they are going to a State institution and that their records don't get transferred locally when they discharge to an aftercare program, or so that people who are referring physicians don't have to think well since the State pays all the money when you're in a State hospital. Maybe it's better if we discharge you quickly from a Harlem hospital and get you off to the State hospital. Unfortunately sometimes people have thought that way and we therefore have a system that is built more on power and money and concern for keeping an institution than we do on whether people are getting the right care in their own community. I would say that we began to make some headway to bring about a single system a couple of years ago with legislation but it's very hard when you think of all of the people who are working in state hospitals throughout the state. There are 50 60 thousand employees. The biggest employer in the state. A lot of those people are poor people Black, Hispanic people working at terrible levels of salaries and not well-trained and you can see why sometimes a few of those employees work out their own frustrations and mistreat patients. Certainly it's not at all the large number of patients. It's not the large the predominant behavior of people working there but there is a demoralization in that system that you don't find in a smaller program where people are better paid and better trained. I would like to be able to help that State system really be responsive to a local neighborhood and help those people get the kind of training that that our staff of all colors and all professions get when they're in any of our community programs. There's a lot of change that's necessary.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:59.540
I have heard you advocate this before you indicated some of the reasons why some of these things might not be done but it does relate to basically the enlightenment of the general population because if you pull these systems together and improve the salary levels and the level of training and hence the level of service it's undoubtedly going to cost more in the short run. Hopefully it will cost less in the long run because people will be rehabilitated sooner.

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:08:28.132
May not even cost more, Roscoe, in the short run because the State hospital system and the State schools for the retarded have kept and increased their budgets even though the patients have been discharged. You know you see all the people that are sitting on the steps of our library, sitting in Grand Central Station, hanging out around the Upper West Side with nothing to do many of them having been psychiatric patients in state hospitals many of them discharged without the opportunities to go to a program like Fountain House or Harlem Rehabilitation enter where I worked for a number of years. All of those people were discharged by the State in order to pressure New York City and all of the other counties to build rehabilitation programs. But the money didn't follow the patients. Now our view is that if that money that is still going into many of those buildings were not only going to improve the quality of care for people who are still there but also going along with staff transferred to local programs that with the same expenditure of money you could get a better service. I think that there could be a much more efficient use of the dollar that's used now in a State institution locally. Part of the reason would be that for many of the people who are in State hospitals now there isn't any Medicaid insurance because it doesn't cover them. That's the way the law is written whereas if they were going if those same people were in a rehabilitation program locally the federal government would be picking up some of that money and along with cities would also but the state wouldn't be picking up less so that the money could be transferred.

Dr. Roscoe C.  Brown Jr. 00:09:58.980
Well your analysis then puts it straight at the door of the politicians, and

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:10:03.590
And the politicians and the unions too to some degree because one of the things that is this year and the governor came out with a plan that would have taken 10 years to implement of gradually getting rid of the state hospitals and allowing counties where they wanted to, wasn't even statewide, where they wanted to to assume responsibility for the chronic mentally ill. Now I'm not faulting the states alone or the state mental health system at all because too often the people, psychiatrists and other people who ran programs, didn't like chronic patients. They were too ill, too delusional, too hard to work with. Let's just deal with nice people like you and me me who might have a depression or might be a little bit crazy or is [crosstalk] just a little bit mixed up. We don't want the severely ill but in the bill that the governor had proposed this year the idea was that a county or New York City could gradually plan toward taking over some of the mental health services but it didn't spell out exactly how the money was going to be transferred. That's one problem. And it did spell out that there would have to be retraining and employment of the people who were there but the unions mounted a huge campaign. The civil service unions, the state employees unions, and so that became a demonstration part of the bill instead. I think that that we that the State has failed really to do right by its low level employees. Absolutely. But by virtue of the fact they haven't done right you have a whole group of people who are scared to death they're never going to be employed anyplace else and those with their rights have to be considered but at the same time if you look at a huge institution with two and 3000 patients you go to any of these State institutions as I do see two or three thousand patients doing very little, and two or three 3000 staff because they do almost have a one to one doing less. I know that some of those staff could be retrained I worked with people in Harlem who had been out of jobs or some had worked in the State system doing custodial work and they were able to be trained to be helping, listening, therapeutic people and get a lot more dignity and respect and have their place as part of our mental health teams.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr.Speaker 5 00:12:06.450
One of the things I think we've learned about all of our public services and that relates to police and correction, mental health is that when the workers themselves are respected as people then they begin to respect the people that they are inclined or hired to serve. Exactly [crosstalk} and don't take their personal frustrations out on the people that they're serving. But you're no stranger to political controversy because in the Mike Holloman, the Dr. John Holloman case you were one of the people on the Health and Hospital's board who voted for Mike's retention.

Dr. June Jackson Christmasaker 3 00:12:38.790
That's right I did indeed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:39.690
Now there are many aspects of that particular situation but basically as I see it it comes down to the fact that our society really isn't ready and I'm talking about New York City, New York State and even federal government to adequately support a healthcare system that provides a high quality of care for poor people. Question I want to ask you is how can we get an increased awareness on the part of the general public in terms of the importance of high quality mental health and other health services for poor people.?

Dr. June Jackson ChristmasSpeaker 8 00:13:17.310
Oh you've said you've said quite a mouthful. Several things. I mean let me just go back to what you said earlier I don't think that we are as a society willing to back up the billions of dollars that are spent 140 billion. All right. That's a lot of money being spent for healthcare. We're not willing to back it up with a service system that means that people are getting good healthcare. That money in many instances is going for services that duplicate one what duplicate what is done by another facility down the street. Expensive technology is has to be purchased by every single institution so that everybody can have a brain scan or some other complicated technical instrument that sits idle much of the time. People in other parts of the same city won't have even the most basic primary care. They're their own family doctors in most of our in it most of our inner cities we don't have family doctors ,the emergency room is the family doctor. So this country apparently is willing to spend money but not to spend money for a system of care. That means when you go to your local physician or program or health center you know that you're going to have all aspects of your needs looked at, that you don't get brushed off because you've got alcoholism as a problem, you don't get your problems turned away from because they don't have to fit into what the skills of the people are have there. How do we change this to something that's better? Well I I'm not sure and we change by helping people who are consumers realize that they've got to be attentive to these concerns while they're well because you know we're pretty powerless constituency if we're talking about the ill. Once people become ill people are not going to care about how they vote or anything else. Doctors as a whole don't care about what patients are saying because patients are considered to be at a lower level than the doctor it's not a partnership between two people one of whom has perhaps a more knowledge than the other but it's a hierarchy, the doctor's on top, the patient's below. If you're a mentally ill patient you're way below so nobody listens. I think the consumer movement in general is beginning to do this and there in fact is even, there are even efforts such as the Council on Consumer Accreditation of Hospitals. Now you know there are commissions that go around looking at hospitals and clinics to see how well-organized they are, to see how many square feet they have to see how many staff they have. Recently people had the audacity to set up a Consumer Commission on Accreditation. It's a great idea because finally consumers will be able to say this is what I want. This is what I like. I don't want to have to wait so long. I do want to know what the lab tests are that you're ordering me for me doctor, what the meaning of them is, I do want you to be able to listen when I say I'm not sleeping and not just shove a pill on me and force me to be dependent on valium or something else as doctors are pill pushing. Consumer movements going to help people become more and more educated. One of the things that we're trying to do in our own department is to bring consumers into our planning and advisory groups in every neighborhood: Central Harlem, Bed Sty, Upper East Side, Upper West Side. Once a month there's a Mental Hygiene Planning and Advisory Group that meets and it used to be concerned with looking at what people needed in neighborhoods and in advising me on that and reviewing and commenting on proposals. Now we're there we're looking at not only what we need but how we're going to get it with no money or little money how we can break down the barriers between State and City how we can have better coordination and they're also commenting to me: Look you know this is an area that you've really been talking about like child abuse and you haven't done anything about. Maybe in our neighborhood we'll have to take some money from adult psychiatric services and put it into this area. Bringing consumers into that kind of group where they are part of a respected organized group will help educate people too. And I think the media needs to educate people a lot more. But there are other policy makers other than us locally. I think the State has to hear people in the Health Education and Welfare nationally have to hear what consumers care about. And I think we as physicians and other mental health and health people have to be a little more open than we have been before to listen to what people are saying

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:31.350
Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we are talking with Dr. June Jackson Christmas who is Commissioner of New York City's Mental Health and Alcoholism Services

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:17:39.591
and Mental Retardation and Mental Retardation [crosstalk]. Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services is the new name of our department beginning in July

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:46.452
And I think it's very important because it does bring right to the fore some of the key problems with key mental health or mental health related problems in our society. But specifically talking about national attention to health and mental health I know that you worked I believe with the Carter transition team and you had a lot of input hopefully by virtue of being there into some of the things that the new administration which is not so new any longer, they've been in for six months or thereabouts, going to do about health. Many of the things that you mentioned about planning and coordination and involvement of the consumers have begun to surface in terms of public statements on the part of various federal health officials and on the part of President Carter himself. What do you think's going to happen? Do you think that he's really going to be able to turn the health industry around? Because it's generally believed now that it's a very wasteful industry. It's true in [crosstalk] terms of the way in which people are receiving service. And of course as I mentioned at the beginning of the program it hits black and Hispanic and other poor people the most. So what do you think is going to happen in terms of federal policy?.

Dr. June Jackson Christ 00:19:00.303
Well ,I've got some mixed feelings about what's going to happen. I took a two month leave of absence from my position here to go down and head the transition group that was looking at the Department of Health Education and Welfare, huge agency, concerned with some vital areas that are affecting minority people and which minority people have very little say at the top. No question of that. I think that that may be improved somewhat under the new leadership with Secretary Joseph Califano. There have been brought in at a high level as someone who comes from a Hispanic background who's heading the programs that have to do with children and the aging and the retarded. And I hope that some of the concerns that minority people are bringing will be will be looked at there and listened to. In the whole area of health because that's so closely related to other human services, I'm not so sure. I think President Carter vowed first he was going to pay a lot of attention to health insurance and that would come into being some time soon. He didn't say when and he didn't say what type but you know in this country most employed people have some kind of insurance, health insurance. However it isn't adequate enough doesn't cover all of their costs or anywhere near it. This is one of the few westernized countries that doesn't have some plan of national health insurance. It's got to come at some point when we look at elderly people in the Black community particularly we're becoming more and older and a younger population. Children's services are inadequately funded now. When we look at Medicare which many people have. The elderly have to carry an awful lot of expenses and if you happen to be old and not poor enough to get Medicaid in addition that means the people on fixed incomes or the person who'd worked for many years and in a job where he now has a retirement or a pension that's fixed or where she's now has some kind of income, Social Security. Very very tough to get healthcare costs taken care of. Now I'm not so sure that the planning that's going on now in the Health Education and Welfare will take into account enough the fact that the needs of poorer people and minorities have to be addressed in a way that doesn't just give money so that you can buy healthcare, but really begins to change the whole healthcare system. As long as you're going to buy into a healthcare system where you don't have any doctors in inner cities or in even lower middle class Black communities, or as long as you're going to buy into a health system in which you have very few Black physicians and other health professionals running institutions on the staff of institutions, and fewer still making policy decisions, it's going to be the same old business of really caring for the white medical establishment's needs and then for white patients basically ,and finally for the needs of minorities. What do I mean? The needs of minorities' healthcare are greater than they are for other people. The way of catching up, a need for health professionals, has to really be a compensatory, and it has to be whether Joe Califano calls it quotas or goals. We have to do a heck of a lot catching up. Whether it's Blacks in health administration or in nursing and other areas in policymaking positions and high administrative positions these factors have to be taken into account. And I'm not sure that they are. A health insurance plan that buys us just some of the same old medical care narrowly defined is not going to work and particularly it's not going to work for minority people. And I don't know if the fact that there've been such gross inequities is being taken into account.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:39.170
All right. Your analysis is right on time and is one is probably most people in the minority community and minority health community would agree with. Question is how do we move from point x to point Z? Because this is political. I think that Carter has already found that his wrist has been slapped somewhat by the medical establishment just by some of the things he's talked about in terms of just dealing with the payment procedures between the patient and physicians. What do we need to do? Do we need another series of riots? Or do we need more vocal spokesmen like June Christmas, or more radio programs like "Soul of Reason"? So what do we need to do?

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:23:19.762
Well we may need all the others. But I think we certainly need some organization among Black communities. We talked a little earlier of citizens and consumers. We also need people who are concerned and know how to plan health services whether they're the physicians, the nurses, the doctors, the psychologists, the administrators and their organizations. They need to be exerting pressure as voters, as a constituency. They need to be going down to Washington now and doing the talking because they're not going to be heard. We met down there in Washington with hundreds of organizations and individuals including many Black groups that I called in to meet. But this kind of talk has to be carried on, and it has to be carried on at a high level so that people who are making those decisions know that there are constituents there among minority people. And they're not going to be paying attention to them unless they are organized and they have coalitions, whether it's the health services executives or the NMA and all the groups, and constantly doing good homework, good papers, good talking with the health group of the Black Caucus. Bringing all that political pressure to bear in education whether it can be called lobbying or not another thing. So we educate those who make those policy decisions and keep reminding President Carter what he may well have forgotten and that no matter what he says Black people put him there where he is.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:41.620
I think that he gets reminded of that by Andy Young every once in a while. And people like yourselves. But I think what you're really pointing up and that's the importance of using the media is that Back groups need to really coalesce and other minority groups need to coalesce around specific issues. I know that there's some failure...

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:25:00.110
Look at for example of Secretary Califano has reiterated his view that abortion should not be paid for out of Medicaid. Now that's a personal view [crosstalk] and that's a decision on his part. That's a personal view and he first of all which one would want to differ with. Secondly he is going to carry that forth as HEW policy now this kind of restriction of the use of public funds for a an operation that is medically indicated, that is wished to have to be carried on by a woman, and agreed upon by her doctor, Medicaid should not carry that cover that? Absolutely discriminatory against poor people and it's going to drive many poor people. many of whom will be Black, brown and tan into the hands of people who are not qualified physicians. Now that kind of thing should be opposed left, right and up and down the line. This is the kind of issue that I think we've got to come to keep bringing to the attention of people who make policy.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:58.602
But it does require organization. I think that that really is the point and as many the social activists who've been on "Soul of Reason" have said that the Black and the minority communities need to become more politically sophisticated and active around key social issues. In fact it's been suggested that those same people who constituted the Health Professionals for Carter, of which I was one back here in New York, ought to be the people who continue to be the health professionals with Black health professionals reminding Carter that there are key health issues that affect all of us. And as you say doing the type of spadework that's necessary to present those papers and present those positions that give viable alternatives. It is one thing to criticize but the other thing is to come up with a viable alternatives [crosstalk] and have you on the package. Exactly. Well as we come toward the close of this evening's program I'd like to ask you something about the general attitude in terms of Blacks toward mental health and the general situation. To what extent have TV programs like "Roots" changed the way in which Blacks feel about themselves? Is Black mental health better ,worse or the same?

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:27:02.620
I think that at least for the short run and perhaps even longer programs like "Roots" that give us a look at our identity, that make us begin to say to ourselves what ought to be a fact, and that is we came from somewhere, we had a past, and we have a future and that these have contributed positively. How long lasting those effects will be I don't know. I think that we're going to have to continue to build upon them and to make sure that identity which is so crucial is followed up with a sense of capability and action in some time. Just having identity in a society that is a terribly racist society no matter what others say unless you have the ability to act you may find your own self-esteem and image being decreased and altered. But it was an excellent beginning and it personified in spite of any of the weaknesses in history and all that it personified the struggle of people to move from the past to the future. And I think that programs like this are an excellent beginning.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:01.062
In terms of your agency, is your agency doing anything to follow up in terms of community discussions around Black image?

Dr. June Jackson Christmas 00:28:07.681
We have a community relations unit which has that did find that in the meetings that had been held in our neighborhoods dealing with many other things the whole view of identity, who I am, came up particularly with teenagers as it always had in the past but also with the elderly. So there's a link right there. Tonight on "Soul of Reason" we've been talking with Dr. June Jackson Christmas who is Commissioner of New York City's Department of Mental Health, Alcoholism and Mental Retardation Services. We've been talking about the impact of the recent economic problems in America on the Black community and necessity for them to become active advocates in programs to improve mental health and other health services for all Americans.
