In May of 1975 the noted author critic Khaled Coombs visited the People's Republic of China with a group of other people in the arts here Khaled Coombs observations on his visit to China on tonight's solar reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:36.670
This is sole of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box and soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.  Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:03.310
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Khaled Combs well-known author and critic who had the opportunity to go to the People's Republic of China often called Red China during the month of May and June and since.  Unfortunately in our society we have not had the opportunity to know much about what's been happening on mainland China over the past 15 or 20 years or has some interesting observations to present and we really look forward to talking with you tonight or about what's really happening over on this continent with the largest number of people in the world.  Thank you for having me on Roscoe.  I don't know if I could tell you what's happening but I can give you some insight.

Speaker 4 00:01:45.830
Yeah you went to America in five minutes tell me everything is happening in America right.  Especially when you don't speak the language of the people who fight ahead.  Right.

Speaker 5 00:01:55.900
But I went with 21 people through a tour sponsored by The Guardian newspaper which is a radical newsweekly here in New York at 33 West 17th Street and most of the people who went with me were photographers or writers or actors and we were part of a contingent called Cultural Workers The Guardian sponsors I think about six or so tours every year and the most it was without a shadow of a doubt the most interesting experience I've ever had we got into Shanghai late one evening and sort of we all went and went to bed and in the morning when we got up about five thirty and we looked out we just saw masses of people.  I mean at least 5000 people exercising and about five thirty in the morning and that's us and that's a chef I know I know.

Speaker 6 00:02:52.120
And the interesting thing is I mean this is and this is your first observation of China.

Speaker 5 00:02:56.860
All the people were dressed similarly you know in the kind of blue or black or very dark brown pajama suits men and women and I went downstairs with my camera but I didn't want to take any photographs yet I just wanted to let the vibrations soak in and the woman were leading the man or the woman were taking the initiative.  I mean there was none of this kind of sex discrimination.  People just seem to be doing what they wanted to do as far as exercises were concerned and very soon a crowd gathered and they're very very polite but they follow you you know.  And I thought at first that maybe they're following me because they're black but my god it's Shanghai you know and everybody goes to Shanghai but every one of the of the members of the party had that kind of experience that you always being followed the Chinese are very very nice following you other respect respectful distance and applauding you everywhere you went.  Fantastic impression of friendliness of interest in your visit not so much in interest.  Not so much interest in what you are or what you do but interest that you would want to come to China and that they're very very proud of their revolution and very proud to show you what the revolution has accomplished.

Speaker 3 00:04:09.700
Now when you talk about that you you talk about the revolution of course you put it in the political context and again the situation in China has been one that the world has the so-called Western world had great difficulty dealing with were the Chinese people that you met aware of conditions in the United States and what blacks in particular faced in the United States and your particular role as in a sense a black intellectual in the United States.

Speaker 7 00:04:40.010
They were remarkably interested and remarkably well informed.  My one of the young guides I missed you was about 23 said to me Comrade Coombs Do you remember the incident that happened in Birmingham in 1963.

Speaker 8 00:04:58.350
So I said What incident.  He said Well we learned in school that a woman wanted to go into a restaurant and he named the restaurant in Anniston Alabama.  You know I could not believe they were just right.

Speaker 7 00:05:10.340
And he went on and on and said yes this is so this is so bad.

Speaker 5 00:05:13.910
Later that week at the University when I went to an English class and two young women came over to talk to me after the class was over and the first question was tell me friend from America what is the black problem about in America.  Can you tell us something about it but there always was that sort of interest.

Speaker 8 00:05:34.340
Yet though I noticed something because I specifically wanted to find out if there were being pro pro me you know so I I would going to a kindergarten and all the children would come up and they would applaud everybody but they would move from my face to another face.  There was no lingering.  There was no discrimination in their minds it seemed to me there was no protest pro affection then I was part of an American contingent and they dealt with me as such.

Speaker 5 00:06:02.420
But when we got into conversations they would find out they wanted to find out questions about specific questions about about black people that do seem to feel though that there is going to be a mass movement of blacks and working class people in this country to overthrow capitalism.  And I had to tell them that they very far from being correct and that it's not going to have an easy meaning no not in several lifetimes if ever.

Speaker 9 00:06:24.990
Oh what in her area do you think that the Chinese people have made the greatest progress obviously this is one of the greatest political revolutions in history and China has a very very large population and has had very serious problems with health and with the famine and just with the maintenance aspects of life.

Speaker 10 00:06:48.590
Right.  So that the fact that they do exist and the fact that their longevity is increasing and so on indicates that they've made significant progress in at least meeting those basic human needs.

Speaker 3 00:06:59.750
But there are other institutions in a society the delivery of health services delivery of education the role of the arts keeping the economy moving as a significant financial system.  These are all things that China in the past has had great difficulty with.  And I would be interested for one and learning something about what kind of progress they are making in these areas.

Speaker 7 00:07:26.880
Yeah well just let me say very quickly that I from my observations they have made tremendous strides in every area.  I mean a population of seven or eight hundred million is fed that population is fed.  You see food everywhere.  You have a sense that people are well taken care of.

Speaker 10 00:07:45.640
Just as an aside what about the variety.  It has been alleged that the Chinese diet though nutritious is not necessarily one of great variety for the masses.

Speaker 5 00:07:56.150
Well I'm not saying it's good or bad it's just as young as a know I seem to have seen in every city that we went to loads of produce in the marketplace and consumer goods in department stores which are really amazing.

Speaker 7 00:08:08.120
Of course the consumer goods are not of the quality that you'd find in sacks or Bloomingdale but they don't have they don't need the kinds of things in Saks or Bloomingdale's the kinds of consumer goods that would be the kinds of consumer goods that you would find in shops in Africa or in the Caribbean that on that kind of level manufactured in clothing and clothing yes and utensils the kinds of stuff that you that one would wear or have in a house.

Speaker 10 00:08:32.929.9999999999418
What about the extensive use of electrical appliances which I know in America we use ad nauseum and you really bring of all kind of energy.  Do they have that.

Speaker 11 00:08:42.260
No I do.  I saw one refrigerator in China where two actually one in the hotel in the suite of a representative from the Cameroon's who was sitting in Peking and one in a private home and it belonged to an American who had gone over there in 1948 stayed and married a Chinese woman and had now become part of the Chinese mainstream he wore the same clothes his daughter did the same things that other Chinese.

Speaker 10 00:09:09.620
Are you suggesting that the Chinese people do not use electric refrigeration and large amount not in not in private homes.

Speaker 11 00:09:17.160
No.

Speaker 1 00:09:17.640
No.  I like how their food products and others there buy food every day.

Speaker 5 00:09:22.350
I mean food is available to them in the marketplace every day and they just go out and do it.  They do the same things that people in underdeveloped countries would do.  But you have a sense that people are well taken care of you have a sense that that the disease that was rampant in all parts of China.  Diseases have been eradicated.  For example I was reading just before I went to China that you know in Shanghai during some epidemics one night in 1920s one the author just said that he happened to be there that during that summer and there were just 20000 thousand babies abandoned in the alleys of Shanghai could never happen today.  You see in the faces of the children that kind of well-being.  So that's food housing tremendous strides but the housing is not an hour not an American or Western sense.  You know in certain parts of China of course people still live in caves and they justify that by saying the caves are very warm during the winter and very cool during the summer months and the housing is traditional you know around in a sort of circular housing and thatched roofs similar to some of the housing that you'd see in Africa in the cities.  The the proof fabric of the housing is the kind of housing that you'd find in a low low income bracket in this country new housing project type housing projects for the workers in factories.  But again you know you can't take the incomes that Chinese make and and sort of try to equate that in any way with with what what we make in this country because housing may cause maybe four to seven yuan.  You know somebody may earn 70 yuan a month which is an average salary I would think housing would before that and food maybe 10 and clothing.  So everyone seems to have a little savings and I would say that the only area where there is not where I didn't see or feel that there were tremendous strides is in the area of one's personal kind of freedom.  You know.

Speaker 3 00:11:26.070
But I guess that's something we get we can talk talk about something.  Well that's an interesting point in developing a society like this that literally moving out of what we in the western world call the Dark Ages of health and education and so on to make these changes over such a relatively short period of time probably has involved a certain amount of control.  And as you mentioned and you talked about housing the housing that the workers live in immediately that to me meant that there's a class difference of some sort or a status difference between the so-called workers and the managers and the intellectuals and the political leaders.  Now the classism in China I imagine is not based on the amount of money you have or private ownership but as you suggest that does indicate to me that there's some differentiation.

Speaker 10 00:12:21.660
And what is the basis of it.

Speaker 7 00:12:23.220
Well let me let me just say that everywhere we went in China we were told that we have not eradicated class system.  We have not eradicated a bourgeois mentality in China.  But we are working to it that there's an eight point wage scale.  People are paid paid in a different stages and we try.  We're trying to eradicate that but I would not say that I saw any fantastic variation in wealth in the way people lived.  Suddenly the peasants lived if they lived in the fields they lived in in a different kind of housing from the housing that you'll find in the cities because it's you know it's just different kind of housing that that you find in both places.  But the cadres who are the the sort of elite the managerial class they have to do manual labor every every year they have to do that they have to go to the fields.  So one would sense that they're on their way to a classless society.  My great feeling is that the Chinese people have made tremendous strides in 25 years and I'd advise anyone to take a trip.

Speaker 10 00:13:25.800
Very briefly are they aware of the political detente between the United States and the People's Republic.

Speaker 5 00:13:31.680
Yeah.  They also like Mr. Nixon which I found rather interesting.

Speaker 1 00:13:35.040
It's very interesting now.  Guest on tonight soul of reasons odd Coombs author critic who is discussing his recent visit to the People's Republic of China.

Speaker 9 00:13:45.330
And as you were saying odd the Chinese people whom you met were aware of the detente and seemed to have some degree of affection for former President Nixon.  I imagine that they know of some of his political troubles Watergate and so on.  What do you think the basis of this particular effect in particular since he was a Republican and Republicans to a large measure had not supported until the Kissinger regime as it were.

Speaker 11 00:14:17.610
The Chinese are very ideologically pure in a way whatever seems to benefit them.  That's what they that's where it benefits them and turns the idea out there.  Yes yes.  So Mr. Nixon is liked because he brought about detente because he brought about an opening up of China to the west which is why the Chinese wanted for a long time.

Speaker 5 00:14:35.640
You know everywhere you go the Russians are denounced.  I mean we may think in this country that they despise Americans but they despise I think the Russians even more that constantly talking about capitalism and social capitalism you know.  And the when you ask about the Russians they say but we will never forget Comrade Stalin.  His pictures everywhere because Tallinn opened his eyes his largesse.  I guess I guess to the Chinese but after the Russians left and in 1960 since they have left there's been a constant kind of devaluing of all things Russian.  For example in one of the hotels who went which is a typically Russian built hotel I asked did the Russians help in the construction of this hotel.  Oh no strictly Chinese.  But you know it's right.  I mean you can look at it and know that it doesn't bear it from Stalingrad and placed in other than the ideological battle that's going on.

Speaker 9 00:15:30.740
Do you think that there might be some racist connotations involved in the relationship between Russia and China.

Speaker 5 00:15:39.240
One doesn't quite know how that works.  I mean one has no great feeling about that.  I think it's more ideological than anything else but the Chinese are convinced that they could take on anyone.  And one of our guides Miss Lee who is a very petite kind of woman but a commissar you know just really very strong.

Speaker 12 00:15:58.380
I now use the term commissars that only it worse.  Now the characteristic of this person actually commissar in charge of a particular cell.  She was in charge not of a particular says well let's say that's 1930 right.

Speaker 11 00:16:12.510
She was in charge of of our group really and was she is a very diminutive kind of woman but very strong.  And when I got to talk to her she said You know I joined the Communist Party when I was 19 and we talked about the Russians and the board and she said you know they only have one million men they can't affect us.  And if they thought Oh if if anytime they think that they can invade us let them come we will just swallow them.  I mean it's almost as if we are speaking here.  This is the way she's talking about a great war the eventuality of a great war between China and Russia.  And she said one thing the Russians thought that we were a bit of pork that they could chew on us.

Speaker 10 00:16:47.640
But they found out that we have a bone in the pork that's really interesting now in a society that's emerging and developing like this.  Education plays a major role.  Yeah.  Could you tell us something about the way in which education is organized in some of the themes that tend to run through education in China.

Speaker 11 00:17:06.599.9999999998836
Well as you know of course everything is ideological good.  There are a lot of kindergartens for four children.  And then let's just start from middle school which is the most important thing that we can talk about in the time we have.  You go to the middle school until I guess you're about 17 18 or 19.  You don't automatically go to college after middle school.  You leave school for two years and you go to work either on a commune or in a factory.  And while you're there for two years the peasants or the workers not your behavior and note your ideological purity when you apply to college you can only get in on the recommendation of the peasants and the workers the peasants workers and soldiers occupy the paramount position in Chinese society.  According to the language of the people according to the idea of the ideology of the people their children are given the preference and go into colleges and as the daughter of a doctor once said to me my father was a doctor.  He had his chance to be a doctor therefore I should be a peasant.  Why should I continue the old class system and become a doctor.  Let me be a peasant if she's certainly well she may be a factory worker or a work on a commune.  But she didn't want to go to college.  She felt that somebody else should take her place because there were only so many places available and that she should do something else now.  So there is this this constant kind of re-evaluation of what education should be an after 1966 after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution when everything closed down in China which I wish we had time to go into it was just tremendous was just tremendously coordinated by Chairman Mao who I think is the political leader of the 9th of the 20th century.  I mean if we were not on such bad terms so I guess less bad terms that the Chinese I think we would recognize him as the premier leader of the 20th century and really speak about him in those terms.  When you say everything closed down what do you mean.  The university just shut down everything shut down and the youngsters of China took to the streets to talk to their elders and talk to other people about the road that the Chinese revolution.  You're suggesting this was all straightened out and was created by him orchestrated in very subtle and and moving kind of way which we can't go into now.  His opponents thought that he was dying you know and that unite the state department and have any sense at all about what was going on in China.

Speaker 1 00:19:26.870
I still don't to a very large extent a lot of that is the fact that there's just practically no communication to very recently.

Speaker 11 00:19:33.420
Well even so our lives on office over there has it's just a liaison office.  It's not not an embassy not an embassy.  And the Chinese again ideological and ideological purity do not fraternize too much of the Americans all with any of the other Western groups.  I happened to go to the African Liberation Day party given at the Embassy of the Cameroon's and what I was there a lot of Chinese diplomats came over.  But at the I found out that the American lives on office not many high officials go maybe you know one or two or three but they never invited only as an officer for example to visit with them in their homes.

Speaker 10 00:20:14.010
And that's where some of the informal communication takes place that really is not able to be taken place.  But I was very assured when you said that the students are evaluated for their ideological purity.  Now what is the test.  And I know here in America we are very concerned even though many times our freedoms are trend stamped stamped on.  We are very concerned about being given political test for various things.  There are such a political test but over it political test tends to be offensive to us in America.  Yet here is a society which actually makes political test or ideological test.  And I'd be very interested in knowing the form of these ideological tests.

Speaker 6 00:20:58.800
I think the test is really a commonality acute cute the way you relate to other Chinese people the hard work that the feeling that you must build socialism that the extra amount of work you say.  I mean you can think it but I'd say it's not good enough to think that you have to write an act certainly always on it.  And how would you act on it.  Well you would take on you would take on probably more duties after school you would do something that would advance the cause of socialism you would read Marx and Lenin to all people and whole discussion groups.  That's what one gets.  I mean that's the flavor that one gets from talking to the young the young people there.

Speaker 1 00:21:35.190
Well now once we human beings are pretty much the same all over the world.  Once the young people who decide they want to go to college learn this couldn't they go through the motions as it were.  Or is there some subliminal test that they use to determine whether it happened again.

Speaker 6 00:21:50.670
I mean every question you raise the Chinese have an answer for it.  That's the that's the great thing about the People's Republic.  But at one university I asked the same question.  And this young lady said to me well we had a case like that.  We had a case like that two years ago.  This man said that he was for the workers and the peasants but he really was from a bourgeois family.  And when he came here he forgot he forgot.  And he said something about our party and about our leader and about the road we should take towards socialism and toward a classless society.  And we got rid of him from the school because he wasn't really devoted to the workers peasants and soldiers.

Speaker 1 00:22:24.130
You know so there's always a kind of always a coward basically there is a political test that's really what you're saying and a move toward reinforcing the prevailing ideology.

Speaker 6 00:22:34.770
I would say and when I say I mean religion does it just doesn't exist in the all people.  There are there are some religious shrines and Buddhist shrines.  Muslims still worship but the young people to the young people it's all a curiosity.  I mean to think that in 25 years this could have been accomplished.  I think it's just amazing that just vestiges of religion in certain areas and again or people and the young people see the superstition and curiosity.  They're too busy with advancing socialism to live their lives through the works of Chairman Mao the real rarely seem to do that.

Speaker 10 00:23:06.300
Do they use much in the way of incentives work incentives.  I know China is very heavy into sports and sports as you know a competitive one person makes a team another person doesn't make the team in the sense that might seem to be antithetical to the socialist ethos.

Speaker 11 00:23:21.690
It is friendship first competition later.  That's another slogan all over all over China but that doesn't work in sports.

Speaker 10 00:23:28.800
And the Chinese teams that have come to America at least have been very very competitive.

Speaker 6 00:23:32.880
Well competitive.  Yes but not in the same sense of.  Of our kind of competition.  Of course they would like to win.  But the friendship is more important that's what they say.  At any rate.

Speaker 10 00:23:43.420
And so.  So the best friend plays not the best player that has gotten I'm sure that isn't the case.  That's really what I'm saying that the best friend.  Players Yeah I mean I would be inclined to think that see having seen some of their teams the best performers are the ones who are on the court or in the ring on the track.

Speaker 1 00:24:01.680
It isn't necessarily the ones who have the best ideology.

Speaker 11 00:24:05.340
Oh yes the best performers are always take part I guess in the sport or whatever but there isn't that kind of do or die competitive spirit that one doesn't get that one guy have you ever seen a Chinese team play in the western world.

Speaker 6 00:24:19.430
Yes I saw them run against them against the Americans in Peking.  And the Americans beat them tremendously.  I mean they would like to win but among people there.  Let me put it this way it seems to be that among the Chinese what is more important is friendship before competition.  Now I don't know how often that was.  Oh okay.  I'll give you a quick example.  At Harvard University I was speaking English with this young girl and another one was there but she wouldn't say anything.  So I asked why aren't you saying anything and she said well you know I don't.  Her best friend said I won't answer.  I would let her answer.  She's very bright but she's very nervous she doesn't think she can speak the language as well.  So I will be silent now and just let her have her say.  There's always a sense of you know taking care of the other person.  The only thing I don't like is and I couldn't live in China because again been corrupted by the and in some sense and the energies that I have.  The individualism that I have just wouldn't mesh with the Chinese philosophy.

Speaker 1 00:25:17.420
You'd have a difficult time writing an article about crime and Hall I guess.

Speaker 6 00:25:20.660
Yes I guess so.  And I guess the only reason that the Chinese Revolution is so successful is the homogeneity of the people.  I don't think that Chinese revolution is really China that homogeneous.

Speaker 1 00:25:32.180
Given the fact it covers a large geographical area a number of temperature and climate zone right here would appear that they wouldn't be that degree of ethnic homogeneity that tends to be proposed by the overall state.

Speaker 6 00:25:46.730
Right.  Well there is the Han nationality which is the largest nationality in the group but there's something like what 51 minority nationalities as they call themselves.  And they're fully protected.  The Chinese tell us that they've studied their own language.  Yeah.  Well there's no way you can you can judge.  I would only say that I was free to go anywhere.  I mean we asked to see the people's camp people's army camp.  But that wasn't on the agenda.  And sometimes you would ask to see things and they would say well it's closed but you had the feeling that there were being as open as they possibly could given the circumstances.

Speaker 10 00:26:26.030
One last question.  How do they relate to Africa.  Well how do they see Africa.

Speaker 11 00:26:30.980
Well everywhere you go they sing songs.  This one little girl would get up and sing my father's in Africa and he's there building the rail the towns and railroad and it's amazing.

Speaker 4 00:26:42.480
Be working on their hands there.

Speaker 11 00:26:45.030
Yeah.  And then they would show you that one iron and steel they'd say Well you know all this iron and steel is going to the railroad tracks in Africa.  And we met a lot.  I met a lot of African students there.  The problem is though that the African students are more interested in the West wanderers than the music style and life life that they could live in the West rather than the ascetic kind of life in China.  So that's going to create some kind of friction and that's what I'm interested in their interaction with Africans.

Speaker 1 00:27:11.640
What do you hope to go back.  I would like to go back maybe in about five or 10 years.  I think I would be an interesting trip and I think everyone in our audience has enjoyed our brief visit to the People's Republic of China through the eyes avoid combs.  Our guest on tonight's show the reason has been awed Coombs author critic who had the opportunity recently to visit the People's Republic of China.  And we've been talking about the development of this large society which has such a great impact on the ways the world today.
