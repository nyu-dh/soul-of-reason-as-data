Fifteen million black Americans have a primary or secondary relationship to a black church. Historically the black church has been the most pervasive social force in the black community here. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker of Cain and Baptist Church of Harlem discussed the role of the black church on tonight soul of reason. This is Soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:41.700
A program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 1 00:01:05.730
With us this evening on soul of reason is Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker who is a professor at New York University or a well-known scholar in black theology and minister of the Kenyan Baptist Church of Harlem. Great to have you with statewide. My pleasure. Well as we were talking at the beginning of the show 50 million black Americans have some type of relationship with a black church not necessarily membership but a relationship. And since they are about 28 million black Americans that means over half of black people have some kind of relationship to a black church. Could you give us some more specifics on that particular relationship.

Speaker 3 00:01:46.060
You know I think there are two things that might be said about that. The first is that when you take into account that it's about maybe 51 52 percent which I believe is a conservative estimate that suggests very strongly that you're talking about a could he a cohesive force that can be mobilized or has a potential mobilization.

Speaker 4 00:02:07.050
The second thing is when you say primary or secondary relationship I'm not talking about people who are dues pay in coming three Sundays at the month I'm talking about those people whose aunt is a member whose mother is a member and who have some cultural or emotional leaning toward the church in recognizing it as a force in the community. And so that's why we say a primary or secondary relationship and it does represent and an awesome collection of humanity.

Speaker 1 00:02:41.310
Well as we were saying at the beginning of the show that some people think the black church bracket bracket everyone agrees this black church has been the most pervasive social force in the black community but not everyone has thought that this was necessarily a positive force.

Speaker 4 00:02:55.530
And I thought I might ask you the question in the direction of the political life in the black community to evaluate the extent to which you think the black church has been a potent political force in the black community almost any institution never gets very far from its reason raison d'etre for coming into existence in the beginning of the black church which we specialists call the invisible church because there were no structures as such to go to and because following the prohibition of the planters and the cotton farmers that they didn't want to sleaze fooling around with the Jesus religion because they perceived very soon that it was having a liberating influence upon them. The black church or black religion went underground and that gave rise to the literature of the Negro spirituals being a kind of a cold language and maintaining even today a double meaning in many circumstances could you give us an example of some of that code language from the spiritual. Well for instance steal away of our familiar spiritual it is a hymn of private prayer of getting away to yourself but it was also used as a code signal for slaves who want to get on Harriet Tubman's underground railroad. It happened to me these specific signal Song of the Reverend Nat Turner's insurrection in South Hampton County Virginia. And many specialists assigned to the author's ship to him whether that it's difficult to corroborate that very difficult yeah. Wade in the water was used down at the creek for baptismal services but it was also a signal song that when the slave patrols were trying to find escaped slaves to get into some water to throw the scent off the bloodhounds. Mary Don't You Weep don't you mourn is another instance that when a slave woman was denied membership in a white church she was so overcome listening at the window to join churches she went down the aisle and of course they told the union you a slave you can't come and she came out heartbroken and other slaves who around there holding onto the buggies dragged masters and the mistresses back to the plantations they start saying Oh Mary don't you leave no more Pharaoh's army. Daniel this is not the end of the world. They way folks are not in charge. Who goes there and who gets saved.

Speaker 1 00:05:11.250
Well let's talk about Europe particularly interest in black music. You've recently completed your thesis my doctoral thesis at Colgate Rochester university and title of the thesis is black sacred music and its influence on social change and of course that's really what you're talking about in terms of its relationship to the political and the social development of the black community could you develop that a little bit more.

Speaker 5 00:05:33.030
Yeah I think there are three primary support systems in black religious life preach in praying and singing and in the early development of black religion in America Black Christianity Africanized Christianity.

Speaker 6 00:05:47.710
The music was dominant because that which had the clearest survival of the Middle Passage of the bizarre circumstances of getting across the Atlantic where one out of every six Africans who were brought across survive. It was the rhythm forms and the musical idioms that survive.

Speaker 4 00:06:06.310
And once we began to handle the language of the New World and discovered the Jesus faith or appropriated it the substance of our religious faith was carried and transmitted and gain cohesion to black life via the music which was transmitted by word of mouth from plantation to plantation farm to farm from state to state and from region to region all across the south. And it was it is genuine folk music. They are just in innumerable studies the most best known I guess of our John and Alan Lomax so that this is the collective statement of individual predicaments. So the spirituals though they are religious. It is also folk music. It is the expression of a quote unquote community. And so it was that it describes what was going on in my thesis was aimed at showing it. If you listen to what black people are singing religiously it is also an index of what was happening to them sociologically and the point that I'd want to raise is what about today's music.

Speaker 1 00:07:12.340
Frequently it said that the soul music of black people today describes what black people are feeling. For example when black pride was really moving along James Brown had a song say it loud you're black you're proud if you listen to some of Marvin Gaye's know what's how what's going on.

Speaker 7 00:07:34.330
Well there's a new song hands. What's happening to us. The song how Melvin thinks. Listen everybody will all of these songs have some type of social message. Now does this mean that soul music is more or less replaced the spiritual as the major form of social communication. Is it got replaced it.

Speaker 5 00:07:54.160
It has supplemented it. And the there's a phenomenon in America that must be brought in. You see in African life in fact in African language there are no words to distinguish between the sacred and the profane. All life in the West African tradition and I narrowed to that because 80 percent of people who came to the Western Hemisphere were from West Africa. All life moves from the religious symbols.

Speaker 6 00:08:23.300
There's no such thing as a non-religious West African. And so we are in those things which survive the middle passage. There was not that separate that separate and distinct ness of the secret in the profane. That's a phenomena of the Western world. Now we could not live in America and be new world Africans without taking on some of the attitudes of the dominant society. So we got into that bag particularly when hymn book worship came about sacred and secular. And you know at one time gospel music was frowned upon in many quarters in organized religious life. But the phenomena of which you speak of these message songs of James Brown Howard Melvin and the Blue Notes and and Aretha Franklin and then modern gospel Andre Craig mine and Russell Murray and Edwin Hawkins etc. to me because I do not subscribe to this sharp distinction of the sacred and secular because they are message songs I say that they are modern spirituals and some musicologist termed them urban spirituals. I think the term is probably relegated mostly to the works of the Edwin Hawkins phenomenon and Andre Crouch in Clinton a back and others see where they make a social commentary and I should add Thomas Dorsey who the godfather of gospel music in America see what he was talking about was how the human spirit survives in the midst of the terrible circumstances of the depression that followed the disappointments of black Americans after World War 1.

Speaker 1 00:09:57.680
Arwa let's talk now specifically about the effect of the black church on modern day American politics. You yourself walk with Martin Luther King SC Elsie the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led the way for many civil rights breakthroughs and today there are many clergymen who are in the black clergymen who were in the forefront of the struggle for first class citizenship and economic sufficiency for black people. To what extent is that a true rheumatic function of the individual. To what extent is that a function of the collective impact of the black church.

Speaker 6 00:10:31.270
Well it's kind of a natural extension of what the black church is.

Speaker 3 00:10:35.530
I said earlier that an institution does not get very far from the reason for its coming into existence and the early church in a cane break in the cotton fields developed as a resistance to the oppression and inhumanity of slavery and that has been true through the Nat Turner Gabriel posit Denmark Vesey era all the way through Frederick Douglass.

Speaker 4 00:11:01.730
The period of reconstruction and post-war reconstruction was dotted with black ministers who were very vocal who wrote tracts who ran for public office and in the era Martin Luther King we just saw it underscored again. And if you follow the movement analytically of Martin Luther King's pyramid of power it followed the preacher trail and the black church trail. Now the arrangement the sociological arrangement in the south the mores the laws restricted us to the black church and it was only natural that our meetings with the black church our constituents constituted with black church people that money was raised there. The workshops were run edited people who went to jail came from the black church.

Speaker 1 00:11:48.170
You know it was a black church operation that started in the late 40s early 50s. Well now in the 70s what impact was a black church have on black politics today.

Speaker 6 00:11:59.300
Well you see we have gotten into a more sophisticated era era where the problems the obvious and blatant problems of the South are no longer there. There are no more segregation so no black and white color colored and white drinking fountains. The problems of the South are now the problems of the urban North.

Speaker 4 00:12:19.010
It's the problem of the cities and the problems are more difficult to get it. And so the shift has been to political solutions. Now every black politician particularly if he's running for public office in a city the first place he goes is to breaches and this is a contrast to people who seek elective office in the white community no nobody would wait wait. What it is. By the way with the white preachers don't have a power.

Speaker 8 00:12:47.030
Although there are certain ethnic groups that have religious identifications that sort of build around that so that American politics has a high ethnic composition. And I think the black church helps the black population to really develop that.

Speaker 9 00:13:01.800
But I think it's more extensive in the black church situation because as I was saying historically view if you want to put it get a handle on what the black church is now you have to look at it in its complete historical perspective and it has always been in my view to one degree or another liberation headquarters now seven eight years ago you know we went through what I call the black power movement and that movement moment.

Speaker 4 00:13:27.590
It did not last very last long enough to move and the guys who are out here with the great big Afros in their fists up in the air you know calling me a jive preacher and so forth. I don't know where the hell they are now. And yet and Baptist Church are still down on 16th Street with a full fledged senior citizens program born given hot lunch to folks who can't afford it run an anti-drug abuse program with sitcoms on the program and you multiply that out larger or smaller in all the other churches you know we're still doing Etsy and that again is an evidence of what the black church is doing in the present moment and with someone like Dr. Whitey Walker moving behind the black church moving behind Cain and Baptist Church you can see why things happen but you fellows in the black church have a lot to do.

Speaker 8 00:14:12.170
We in the black community expect a lot of you and one of the biggest problems we face in the black community is crime. Crime of black people against black people. And I know the answer to them. News John pro cope and Eddie Ray have started the campaign against crime in Harlem and a lot of people are picking it up and we all know the crime in any community is not a simple matter. But what is or can the black church do to deter to stop crime in the black community.

Speaker 5 00:14:44.450
I've given us a lot of thought and I talk with John Prothero and I told John Brokaw very honestly that I did not think that the black church had the resources or the track record to take a leadership role. But I do think it can give us some very helpful supplementary aid to it. And one of the things that I have been doing for all of the years that I've been in on it 16th Street is to try to ingrain in my people that they must not buy hot goods. And I tell them if you buy a hot television or hot radio or hot anything all you are doing is aiding and abetting you know that undercover crime that goes on and next thing you know they're gonna be ripping off your apartment and getting your thing and selling it to somebody else as long as black people are open to buying things that are hot you know in beauty parlors and barber shops then not only aids and abets said that that kind of criminal is you really dealing with something that strikes right into the nature of black life in our society basically black people have learned to survive from the days before during slavery and the days right after slavery by.

Speaker 1 00:15:56.440
We call it hustling in the black community by using various techniques to beat the economic oppression and one of those techniques has been to take food from the master's table and to save the good food for themselves. And then finally to do as you say by hot goods or stolen goods.

Speaker 5 00:16:14.290
And I'm not supporting that as a result more bottom line to build it into what you were saying earlier about a tortured logic of saying it's okay to take it from the oppressor because he has robbed us so long over a long period time.

Speaker 1 00:16:28.810
But what I am talking about these hot goods are not stolen from white people stolen from other black because that's really the price of the pointed you developing that if you develop a mentality of buying or taking something is not yours. Whereas initially you can justify it by taking it from the white person or the white business but then you end up taking from the Black Person of the black business and becomes counter-revolutionary counterproductive. And I heard someone say in this Amsterdam News fight against crime that when a mugger a black mugger mugs a black woman who 72 years old and takes her Social Security check that's not a political act as many people have suggested that black crime is.

Speaker 10 00:17:11.440
But I had limits and I get the feeling now. And let me check this out with you that much of the concern in the black community as really with the white community is what you call violent crime crimes where someone is hurt by the body in relieving them of some of their money or some of their goods. I still get the feeling that basically this war against crime in Harlem or the war against crime anywhere in America really doesn't deal with really crime. I mean the crimes where a landlord takes a building and doesn't keep it up. Yeah. Just by way of deal with white collar crime deal with money crimes a white collar it only deals with physical crime now. It's probably true that physical crime has some other fallout because many people just get maimed and hurt for life or even get killed. So that's a good point to start. But how do you really get at that in the black community in your church where people have all kinds of unemployment and family problem and they say look I got to get over anyway I can get over and you've been teaching us three spirituals and so on that black people had double messages and so on. How does the black church really deal with that.

Speaker 11 00:18:13.900
Well I must say I know that the time of quiet as I don't know.

Speaker 9 00:18:18.280
And I think we are in a period of experimentation because a street crime in the black community is so deep now that we cannot bear it. It is unbearable now you know night services in Harlem and in most of the Harlem that this country is a thing of the past. You just can. I have had people mugged at the water fountain in the lobby of my church. I mean that's how bad it has been. It's not like now but at one time it was our first involvement in the fight against the drug traffic was only for survival. We could not get into the church. Yeah we could not get into the front of our church because of the people coming in from Connecticut and in Pennsylvania and North Jersey and as far away as Massachusetts to make their drug pick. You know Malcolm X in his lifetime said that that side of 160 street in that block was the worst street in Harlem. So our first struggle was not so altruistic as it was to survive and then it led to many other things and of course the street is considerably better than it was but a long way from where it ought to be. And the thing that must be said is that this street crime is directly related to the unfettered traffic in drugs. And the thing that I'm always fighting a battle there and the twenty eighth policing is that every time I turn around you know it seems like the police are harassing us the people trying to lift a community with parking tickets because we double parked trying to keep the programs going.

Speaker 11 00:19:43.550
And the local pusher is out there selling it right.

Speaker 12 00:19:46.750
I mean you can buy you can buy drugs in on 16th Street cricket and you can buy aspirin. And just yesterday afternoon. I mean there's there's a crap game going on stoop and comes riding up and down the street and I'd go up to precinct and I'd jump up and down and I said look I'm a preacher I'm in the souls I've been I say if I can see you a policeman I know you can see but those are the kinds of frustrations that we face.

Speaker 9 00:20:10.240
I don't know I really know what the church can do other than in a supplementary way to try to induce in our people a sense that you got to keep your children off to drugs you got to ask them questions about where they're going and what they're doing. You got to if they live in your house and you provide them with shelter and food and you got them they must come to church. Church care hurt him you know it may not help but it certainly can hurt see and the track record is such that they'd probably be better persons for.

Speaker 10 00:20:35.090
Yeah because for one thing aside from the theology there are other types of creative activities for example you have one of the finest if not the finest gospel choir in New York City.

Speaker 11 00:20:44.920
Yeah. Well like we like it. I think so.

Speaker 1 00:20:47.540
I really appreciate your honesty because what you really did was not to try to give a panacea.

Speaker 10 00:20:52.430
You said look as a serious social problem that you as a theologian as a minister as a scholar really can't give a quick and easy answer to let me say when I say you do have the problem of the whole system. You know the criminal justice system the reason why the officers claim they don't break up the street cap crap games and arrest the local pushers they bring him in at 11:00 o'clock and he gets his lawyer.

Speaker 11 00:21:16.550
What have you got to doing the same thing now.

Speaker 12 00:21:20.750
I sometimes wonder if that isn't a rationalization if he kept being half every day three times a day I guess I guess he'd get tired of it but also what I don't see how do find it down and write all these tickets a double block cars any new york particularly outside of the midtown area double parking is a way of life. There is no other way for a place you call structure has just no geographical space for automobiles C and the guys with the big wagons and spoke wheels and all that. They don't get tickets and if they do they ignore them you know. So you know there's some hanky panky going on. The second thing I want to say Roscoe before it leaves my mind is that we got we have to find some way to tell our people that if they are going to be safe then they can't take the attitude that they don't want to get involved. When they see a crime being committed they have to call the police and be willing to testify. Yeah I saw him. That's the one who did it. See if we if we keep on having a society who doesn't want to get a lot. You know to the Kitty Genovese case out in Queens. Let's ask example he has a woman losing her life and calling for help ask a community and nobody wants to get involved in it happens over and over again. None quite so publicized as the Genovese case. But what we've got to be able to say yes that's the one who snatched the pocketbook and how come to court and testify. If if hoodlums and criminals think that they can continually get away and use the the different mandates of the Supreme Court of gangs the the the law abiding citizens then our society is going down the drain as a black minister.

Speaker 1 00:23:04.790
I would assume that you talk about this in your church I assume and not only do you give sermons about it but this is a dialogue goes on in youth groups and your senior citizens groups etc. see because we survive in a community for instance our church is open seven days a week.

Speaker 13 00:23:21.440
And the only night that we do not have some kind of activity is on Saturday night because you know we kind of give folks a break for Sunday but during the week we have a system that if you can't park near the church you go to the drugstore next door and they provide an escort and they'll ride with a lady to where she can get a bike and place and then when she comes out they will walk with her to her car and then she bring that person brings that escort back and drops him off at the center. I mean we have all kinds of contrived ways by which we try to minimize the risk of somebody being a victim of street crime.

Speaker 10 00:23:53.090
But basically you're saying this is something that the black community has to really take a massive onslaught toward and they have to change some patterns for example as you suggest they have to stop buying hot goods regardless of where they come from Zach.

Speaker 12 00:24:07.840
You're also suggesting that they should be willing to as you say testify get involved identify victims perpetrators and the victims and be willing to take the time off to go to court and get these people some hard dime for the kind of mayhem they inflict upon the community.

Speaker 1 00:24:26.210
Now in a sense what we're doing here and what the answer them is doing in terms of using the media their newspaper what we're doing using the air to communicate these particular points of view really is the development of a first step in any social problem you're developing there were the awareness level exactly so that when John broke open Amsterdam News really it is that there are a number of significant things that has been done in by the black press locally in New York and along by now we have to build on that awareness behind action and that's where we come into that. And I want to move into another area which is directly related to this that has to do with black family life. We know the now discredited probably discredited when it was published Moynihan Report which said that black family life is falling apart because some 38 percent of black families were headed by women and that they the basic glue that was holding black families together just wasn't there. I don't believe it. I don't believe you believe it. But the question is what is the black church doing to upgrade the quality of family life regardless of whether it's a single parent family or two parent family.

Speaker 5 00:25:34.280
Well see I talked to Pat Hanna Pat Monahan down in Miami Beach you and Dr. King had a big convention there and I told him that much of the resentment that he got from black people about his report was because he started with a wrong premise. If you start with the wrong premise you've got to come out with a wrong answer and he has a middle class white person does not understand the kind of structures of black family life. Now a black family does not consist of a father mother and two children. It may consist of any kind of varieties of combinations that may be a grandmother and two grandchildren because we find that a lot of white families today same thing as Mike Johanns work workers even more discredited.

Speaker 10 00:26:12.900
The fact that there are large numbers of white families out of extended families or single parents.

Speaker 12 00:26:17.110
But the the variety of ranges in the black.

Speaker 13 00:26:19.810
Is far far more diverse is far more diverse and it is cultural. It is it is a part of the extended family concept which is again one of those African survivals in in in the western world and the black church is a kind of family. We talk about the Keenan family more than we do talk about the Kenyan church and we have a list of all people in the church who live alone and we have a system by which those people telephone calls are made to see if they are I guess we've had circumstances where people live alone you don't hear from four five six day or you missing from church then you go door to door is locked the police. That's a beautiful family concept. And so we try to talk about. It's almost like a buddy system. But we do it on a family basis. That is one of the ways we do it. We have tried to make our senior citizens important we have a full fledged senior citizens program one five days a week and we use a senior citizens in relationship to helping us with the youngsters who may not have a blood relative that kind of thing. We have adoptive parents we have foster parents we you know we do placement with that kind with troubled children. And so those are the kinds of things that we do to try to strengthen the family life internally in the black community not only that those are excellent explicit examples of what can be done.

Speaker 8 00:27:33.630
Are there any philosophical things that can be done. Are there any things that we need to do about bringing together the the oneness of black people.

Speaker 9 00:27:43.950
Well you know that's like Dr. that's like a Jewish community you know and we react very much like the Jewish community.

Speaker 13 00:27:52.440
We are very separate in a sense. But when you move in on us it drives us together with a sense of cohesion. And so I don't know I don't know whether I would have time left I could answer that but I think we need to have a unity of goals rather than perhaps a unity of function.

Speaker 8 00:28:09.320
OK. I think that's a good point I wish to close our program tonight. Our guest on the night soul of reason has been Dr. White t Walker whose pastor of the Kennett Baptist Church of Harlem. He's a black theological scholar who's interested in black music and he has shown us in his discussion tonight just how effective the black church can be in dealing with the social forces that black people face in America. Thanks again for being our guest on night sole of reason why. Thank you Roscoe.
