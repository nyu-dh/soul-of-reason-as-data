This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 2 00:00:48.680
Books on slavery have proliferated in the 1970s. Roll Jordan roll by Eugene generating the black family in slavery and freedom by Herbert Gutman and Alex Haley's Roots. Tonight on soul of reason we'll be talking with Professor Nathan Huggins of Columbia University about his new book on slavery black Odyssey and Nathan we're glad to have you with us again on several reason. Glad to be here Roscoe. The last time you were here I believe we were talking about your book the Harlem Renaissance and the reaction to the book and now you've moved all the way from the 1920s back to the 1720 in dealing with the Afro-American ordeal and slavery which is the subtitle of your book Black odyssey.

Speaker 3 00:01:33.650
So you tell us exactly what the focus of this new book is. Well the book invites a radical change in perspective about slavery. It comes from my own sense and I'm sure you've added to that whenever we've thought about slaves and slavery. We've put the burden on them to prove that they were qualified for freedom. And it comes out of the same sort of situation where we always put on to the victimized and the oppressed the burden of proving they're there there their right to be something else. And that's really I think happened traditionally in the way Americans have dealt with slavery. And what I've tried to do in the book is to say something that I think is very important. Slaves were not a peculiarity in the American situation. America was a society based on slavery and that rather than call it a free society one has to talk about it as a slave society.

Speaker 4 00:02:40.460
Could you give me a little clarification on that. I think everyone recognizes that slavery was an indigenous part of the development of America and it's very clear that black people were not free or did not enjoy any of the fruits of democracy. Up to 1865 and even after and now are you suggesting that in our rhetoric about the United States we should not even use the rhetoric that it was a free society. Are you saying we should use the rhetoric that says it's part free and part slaves.

Speaker 3 00:03:13.910
Well it's not simply a matter of rhetoric as a matter of the way you look at the society's development itself and what on what it's dependent. And what I'm saying is that it's true that all of the institutions that were developed from the before the revolution and certainly crystallized in the Rose Revolution argue for the Enlightenment notion of freedom and liberty.

Speaker 5 00:03:37.430
But the society that we were that that was developed even the Society coming out of the revolution was one that was essentially dependent upon a slave a slave population and slave labor. And if it were not for that whatever elements of freedom people enjoyed in America those who enjoyed freedom they would have to you know it would not have been there that it would have been a totally different kind of society without that kind of slave element in addition to that. You know even those people who are all those white people who consider themselves free people were limited in a very important ways because of slavery to say they couldn't marry freely they couldn't socialize freely they couldn't make choices that they might make because they had to defend an institution of slavery which was extraordinarily important to the whole social fabric.

Speaker 6 00:04:31.580
Now in developing the book what do you actually do. Do you deal with how black people describe and felt about slavery or do you do more of a socio philosophical analysis of slavery from the point of view of the black person.

Speaker 7 00:04:50.150
Well I would say know I do a socio philosophical analysis except that's a bit off putting when you listen. Hear that hear it. But in fact what it is is is you know I take the pie you know I spent about 10 years of work in the in the archives and the documents on it.

Speaker 5 00:05:06.980
But the book doesn't have a lot of it that has no footnotes. It's just simply a long series of series of essays. But what I do is I take distill those those documents and that report out of slave statements the M. statements and all and I attempt to get the reader close to the actual experience of the slave and what the slave was dealing with in a society which was an unfree society and not a not a not a not a free society. That I asked the reader to to shift his perspective and not to consider slaves as just being sort of a strange thing in there in America but a slaves is a very real part of a of a total social and economic condition. Which they were the the extreme instance of UN freedom. And I want the reader to see what slaves wanted to do what their aspiration to are likely to be what their possibilities were likely to be under a situation of that kind of oppression and in doing that I think I shift away from the question what I want to do is to shift the reader away from the question of whether or not slaves revolted or slaves resisted in all that I think that's all been proved and stated enough. But the point is that though you know the great bulk of slaves were like the rest of us we you know tried to get along and does that mean that they were less than heroes or less than people. But my emphasis is to try to show that within that experience of managing of surviving of making it of trying to hold your family together or trying to have a religious meaning in your life that there was a great heroism in it and the preserving of of of humanity despite the circumstances it would absolutely destroy it.

Speaker 8 00:07:03.770
And as you think about this here we are in nineteen seventy seven slaves first arrived here let's say 60 sixty 1916 twenty five whenever you the you decide on the date and literally black people were enslaved.

Speaker 6 00:07:22.280
The majority of black people 90 percent of them were enslaved right through 1865 which represents something on the order of two hundred and fifty or more years. And that means as we conceptualize here and our brief lifespan that it represents five and six times any lifespan in any of us in the listening audience can think about it today where slavery where people were actually owned and traded and so on was the mode of life in the United States of America. Lo those many years even from the standpoint of the Founding Fathers the Constitution validated slavery for another 20 years. And in a sense in counting the state's population representation in the House of Representatives call slaves three fifths of a man. Yeah. And that was again one hundred and fifty years ago. Are they about. So we have a tremendous uh expression of a man being controlled by some other men on the basis of race and then to put that into perspective of things like you talk about about family and religion. That's really an interesting thing to contemplate. Herb Gutman uh Professor gunman uh recently was on our program talking about his book The Black family and slavery and freedom. And he contended that black families stay together far more than the popular stereotype suggested with pictures of the slave masters snatching a baby out of the arms of a mother and selling them on the block and so on. What does your research and what is your reflection about the black family in slavery tend to show.

Speaker 7 00:09:08.420
Well I I'm very impressed with government book it. Yeah. Not only does he. Well he doesn't really diminish the the. Or reduce the the emphasis on the break up of families that to sale. But what he is saying as I read it is that the family despite the breakup had a consciousness of itself and a sense of cohesiveness. So that even when people were broken up and they were sent miles to the other states other regions that there was even a year there continued within their lore and their imagination their memory. In very conscious ways a relationship to two to family that that had been left behind. Now this is quite contrary to what traditional views of of the slave family were the 20th century sociologists like he Franklin Frazier and later Patrick Moynihan Daniel Patrick Moynihan have argued quite that the family didn't exist but Gutman has demonstrated and he has brought in his book you know who he really shows you family trees. But not only that he says anything else is very important by looking at the data itself he is able to show and to argue that it wasn't merely that slaves had families but they were not families that were modeled after master's families or the white family. And he shows this by demonstrating for instance that there a there a very strong taboo among the slaves and continues among Afro Americans against marrying cousins or in bigamy whereas among whites and certainly among the masterclass marrying cousins was a rather common thing partly in order to hold property together. It's that kind of thing and also he shows it a naming pattern so that what one discovers in looking at Gutmann and I think I certainly support that in my book is that there is within the black consciousness and slavery in the slave consciousness a sense of belonging to something that is not a master but belonging to oneself and belonging is something one could call a family of having a very strong sense of father mother brothers sisters uncles aunts grandparents and so on so much so that you know a couple of generations later you will be finding as Guttman demonstrates by his family trees that he draws that you will find people naming children after grandparents or great grandparents long sense. Dad of course but not only that long far distant they had been the family itself had been moved far dispersed.

Speaker 6 00:11:52.480
Right now you talk in some of the material about your book about the fact that a variety of tribal groups have merged into an American people. I guess you mean that for Americans. Where did you find in your research that contributed to this. Because black Americans really came from a variety of places in West Africa even a few in East Africa mainly from West Africa with somewhat different cultures different languages to be sure which I guess is one reason why the black dialect thing we now identify with really developed because that became the main mode of interaction between slaves themselves between various cultures. But what did you find that cause these various culture groups what we might call tribal groups to merge together into an Afro-American peoples.

Speaker 9 00:12:50.500
Well it's hard to say that I found anything concrete that said that it's just the observation of what happened. You come you start with peoples from a number of different language groups and a number of different peoples tribes or whatever you want to call them with different different cultural characteristics.

Speaker 10 00:13:11.080
And in the colonial period you still have a very strong sense of tribal identification for instance in India in the 17th the 17th hundreds when you have a stone no uprising and in Charleston or in South Carolina you find that most of the people are who are rising up to run away to or to escape and to Spanish Florida are Angolan and they identify themselves sort of tribally and then the colonial period early colonial period you find a great deal of that kind of travel identification you find in the documentation itself and fugitive slaves and so on indications of tribal markings and tribal tribal habits the person's language is still African rather than English or a mixture of the two.

Speaker 9 00:14:01.450
But by the time of course you get down to the mid 19th century even though they are still African there is still an African presence which I think is very important there. It has it has merged that that the subsequent generations of of slaves have become afro american in the sense that they don't make the distinctions among themselves that they are all a part of a one people.

Speaker 7 00:14:26.980
And that's I think an extraordinarily important thing because if if E Pluribus Unum means anything at all in America it means that with respect to black people because out of Africa you get these many different peoples and out of it you come with ways today look around and look it in the face of a black person and say brother we you know we don't have any sense that he's Angolan or she's Fante or anything like Garber.

Speaker 11 00:14:52.570
But Abby I don't I don't sole reason we are talking with Professor Nathan Huggins from Columbia University and we you're talking about his new book on slavery black Odyssey which is published by Pantheon press.

Speaker 12 00:15:03.970
And speaking about relationships to Africa and black backgrounds and black genealogy in a sense Alex Haley's Roots has brought this right to the fore. And it's probably had the greatest impact of any particular piece of written material on the black experience or an awareness of black experience since Uncle Tom's Cabin however many people in evaluating Hayley's work say that yes these are things that we've all known.

Speaker 8 00:15:32.470
It's just that by personalizing them in the form of the Kennedy family in the form of Kunta Kinte and Kizzy and Chicken George it become it takes a form that everyone black and white can identify with some of the critics of Haley's work have suggested that it didn't really take you know 12 years of research to find out that the Kennedy clan is from Gambia and that basically as you suggest by the eighteen fifties or thereabouts many blacks most blacks in America had ceased to identify with their African backgrounds. How do you react to some of those criticisms about the meaning of roots in terms of its African genealogical backgrounds.

Speaker 10 00:16:29.110
Well I have two kinds of reaction about. First of all I think that part of the you know the great enthusiasm and the spirit of roots comes out of the personal quest of Alex Haley himself. Here is a man who who decided he wanted to find his past and he went out and did it. He did it to his satisfaction and some people may not think that it's authentic or that he made an actual contact with what are the the the ancestors of his forebears but nevertheless he's satisfied and I think it's a valid. It's certainly a valid thing we all came from someplace in Africa and we could probably in certain ways hopefully we could all get our way our way back there if we had the time and the documentation that Alex Haley went in the twelve years I think it was involved in his satisfying himself personally that he did it and you know when you ever you talked to Alex Haley you get that very real sense of a personal quest. And I think that part of the popular enthusiasm about it aside from the fact that everybody in this country black and white is trying to identify themselves with some kind of heritage some kind of past because there's something in the American experience which which is unsatisfying because it's so new it's always so new. It's always renewing itself and that's positive sometimes. But at this time in our in our history everybody's wanting to say where do we come from. And Haley's book dramatically demonstrates that that can be done. Also I think you're absolutely right that the ability to personalize it and to say that there are characters in their personalities and they are some they did dramatize it in personal ways certainly makes it a very popular kind of love thing. How do you know they they think the criticisms of it are on the basis of historical historical accuracy and to some extent historical interpretation and some of that. I you know I think the questions are dates like when the Nat Turner revolt actually occurred our problems which really his publisher is responsible for because the editors ordinarily clean up our errors because all of us make them when we write books. But you know I think that there are other kinds of things that I would question his interpretation about and one is the continuation of Africa the emphasis in the book which I question is that. And that's partly because of this dramatic and personal enforces that here as though this one family and this man got off a boat and he was an African 160 Africans on this boat. And from this point on there is no Africa there. But we know that there are a lot of Africans of his forebear who got off that boat came into a plantation or social situation in which most of the blacks that he came in contact with either knew something about Africa personally because they may have to have been African or that their parents had been African. So they were not going to deal with him as an odd Bass Strait is strictly an oddball in the way that the book sort of gives you to believe that as a matter of fact of in the New York Times I think it was last week there was this marvelous us for photographs that were taken in 1850 of Africans that were some of the first photographs ever taken by 1850 in South Carolina and now they are up in the Harvard Library that they had just been uncovered in the Harvard Library of all of Africans there Holder man. It's true but these were native born Africans. This is 1850. Well that tells us something about the continuation of Africa and Africans within the within the American experience and that I think is something that roots doesn't really take.

Speaker 12 00:20:28.210
Give us say a true picture of in a word though if you were to summarize the impact of roots on let's say the black consciousness. What would you say that impact would be. We are. We exist.

Speaker 7 00:20:42.460
We exist we are we have a past we have you know and it's legitimate. The. I think I legitimacy I would say that religion has really legitimized our part.

Speaker 8 00:20:52.920
That's right. And I heard that and got probably as as much to do with anything because the Uncle Tom's Cabin which was another book about a hundred years before me one that that had an impact on the conditions of blacks. And again it personalized that and the brutality and the horror of slavery.

Speaker 12 00:21:13.510
So that some whites particularly good identify with but really had very little impact on blacks themselves. You're right. It wasn't a book written for blacks I would say the roots as a book. You know Alex would say it's written for everyone I really think it's a book it's written for blacks about blacks and whites can identify with it because many of the cultures of a variety of backgrounds in this society have gone through circumstances where they've been transplanted. None however have gone through the oppression and brutality that blacks have gone through through the slave experience. And that really brings us back full circle to black Odyssey and that slave experience. And I wanted to ask you a little bit now about religion. I know and generations book Roll Jordan roll. He proposes some theories about blacks and religion. Specifically what do you think the impact of Christianity was on black life and quite possibly why did blacks assume Christianity as against some other religion particularly moslem religion.

Speaker 13 00:22:16.750
Well I think the way the way I tried to present this in in black Odyssey is to show that it wasn't really it's not quite right to put it that way. This wasn't Christianity's impact on blacks it was blacks impact on Christianity as much as anything the matter is that you have a number of you have Africans coming into the new world and they are bringing with them a cosmology that that goes back into their own traditions and they are faced with. And one might say that most of the the religions of African peoples are rather tolerant. That is to say that they are open to somebodies new notion of what is God as long as it fits into their note into their sense of how real it wasn't strange that the Africans should adopt Christ certain elements of Christianity and in time of course speak those elements begin to grow. The important thing is that what do you one begins to see about the Christian the black Christian experience is that it becomes in very many important ways Africanized and it.

Speaker 10 00:23:27.490
And what I mean by that it to be it has an extraordinary sense of nature of the attachment of the person to to nature and ongoing natural force there is that there's a strong tendency among the Afro American religionists to play down the the possibility or the power of of the personality but to identify pretty much with a spirit which is sort of pervasive that kind of thing is I think the heart of the how the Afro American Christian experience and the slave Christian experience.

Speaker 6 00:24:04.780
Do you think that the Christian experience helped to sustain blacks against the oppression. Do you think that the appeal to the true so-called just God to the other worldliness to be able to sustain one's selves against oppression. Do you think that those lessons are really infiltrated the black slave experience or do you think that this was used as a part of the code system to translate information between each other about attempts to run away attempts for freedom and so on.

Speaker 13 00:24:40.780
I think I think that it really infiltrated the the the slave consciousness and the slave mind and it was a way of sustaining and partly because of the fact that certain elements of Christianity verified something that they knew to be true. One that they were important that they had a validity and and an importance that they were part of a natural process that was larger than them but not only that that their masters despite the amount of power that the masters had were also a part of that process which was bigger than them. They also had by Christianity a a measure standard of rule by which to measure their masters to make judgments about them which their masters themselves had to at least address themselves to whether they were there whether they wanted it were going to be Christian or not is another question. But when you when you confronted the master with his own measure was a very important thing element in the way in which slaves dealt with Masters and dealt with themselves. That Christianity was an extraordinarily important element in the in the slave experience because it provided a kind of common language a language and an ethos that could be shared between master and slave and a standard by which the master could be held.

Speaker 8 00:26:04.470
Well as you evaluate your book and this other rash of books just mean a tremendous number of books about slavery blasting King's book and generations book and so on. Do you think that this recent rash of books about slavery has done much to help people understand the institution its impact on blacks back in America.

Speaker 10 00:26:30.450
Well aside from from from Blazing games book the other the governments and generations are pretty big books and I don't know how broadly they are read. We have Fogel and Englishman's title go cry. Yeah. Which is also a very difficult book to read and and very confusing because most people don't know they're there. How do they evaluate it statistically. But what I would say is that that there has been and and an important new contribution from all of it. And it has largely been due to the fact that it is telling people that slavery was well you know that it's forcing people to rethink slavery and the more they rethink it they have to rethink the society itself. And then thinking about the society it means that they have to to reevaluate the present in terms of that kind of past.

Speaker 12 00:27:24.000
Well as we begin to do that. Books like yours and books like generators and books like roots will help us as black people to understand a great deal more about what we are going to confront in the next century or centuries as we live out the American experience. Yes I think so now in a final summary. Dealing with your book you've written a Harlem renaissance in written black Odyssey. How did you live through these two experiences. Did you really immerse yourself in the climate the environment or was it just something that was basically a scholarly work.

Speaker 13 00:28:03.540
Well my work is characterized by a highly personal character it's more personal than most. The historians write and I find that the best kind of writing that I do comes when I am myself most intense and you were both intense on both.

Speaker 11 00:28:21.300
Oh yes I'll say our guest on a night. So the reason has been Professor Nathan Huggins Professor of History at Columbia University and we've been talking about his very interesting new book Black Odyssey which is published by Pantheon press. And as usual Nathan it's been very nice having you with us.

Speaker 14 00:28:36.750
It's been my pleasure glad to come you've been listening to soul of reason with your host the director of the Institute of Afro one African affairs at New York University Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. and featuring a distinguished guest voicing the black experience. Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC public affairs department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University. Please join us again next week.
