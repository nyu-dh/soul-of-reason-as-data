The role of New York University track heroes reads like a Hall of Fame off track.  Among them Dr. Phil Edwards Jim Herbert Frank Dixon Reggie Pearman Larry Ellis Byron Dyce Cliff Bertram here Cliff Bertram the new NYU track coach discuss the future of track at New York University and in the metropolitan area on tonight's soul of reason.

Speaker 2 00:00:45.520
This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box soul of reason is produced by BW NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time.  Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:12.250
Our guest on tonight soul of reason is Cliff Bertram who is an NYU track hero and is now the track coach at New York University.  Having succeeded the well-known Joe Healy who was his own coach.  Glad to have you with us tonight Cliff.  Different opinion.  Dr. Brown now tell us a little something about you.  Cliff Bertram and how you got to be NYU track coach and why you see it is such a challenge because I know having talked with you before the program you do see it as a challenge.  So let's talk about how you got into track and what you did in NYU and why you see the job as such a challenge in the first place.

Speaker 4 00:01:52.300
Come into NYU in 1958 was quite an experience for me and I got in here I had some of your classes I got to know a lot of people the president and the people in charge of financial aid.  I got into a truck through Joseph Healy and Richard Pearman who eventually adopted me as his protege and I went back home to Trinidad and I had no intentions of coming back United States.  I thought this would have been the end of everything.

Speaker 5 00:02:24.640
You went back when you graduated from NYU 1962.  What were you doing when you went back to Trinidad.

Speaker 4 00:02:29.050
I taught at the Moscow teachers college.  I worked with the government down there and after staying there for a while I started go my friends in terms of wants and needs.  I decided to come back to get a master's degree and to finish my studies.  I got back here in 1968 and I started teaching at junior high school to 52 in Brooklyn and I still kept in touch with track as a result of this.  I'm here now as a track coach which is all a big surprise to me.

Speaker 3 00:03:02.470
I didn't really expect something like this where all the other things that you and your modesty.  You haven't said like the records you hold I believe you at 37 now 36.

Speaker 6 00:03:11.670
Well yeah I'm 37 years and you have run a quarter mile faster than most people run it at the age of 17 or 18.  And I believe you hold the world record for that particular age bracket and the time is something like 47 6 or something like that.  Yes.

Speaker 7 00:03:27.960
And there was record for 100 yard dash at age 30 7 9 6 and the 300 yards was thirty point one the 220 which is twenty point nine.

Speaker 8 00:03:38.860
And I think this is you know although you are a hard man to keep up with and having that as a competitive background and still being an active competitor as well as having worked as a coach with the United States Youth Games team from New York and having worked with high school teams you have an excellent background to come into New York University as a track coach a school which has a tremendous history in terms of track for example to the top of the show we mentioned Dr. Phil Edwards who's a black physician but probably better known than that although he probably had more service to humanity over the long haul was his winning of the Olympics.  I believe you represent a candidate that time yes.  In 1928 I believe it was at a time he was a student at New York University and there were very few blacks competing and then the distance event the lady was considered to be a distant event and at New York University and people like Jim Herbert who also competed in a half mile Frank Dixon who was a miler at a time when blacks weren't supposed to be miles and he ran a four ten mile Reggie Pearman who as you say like a brother to you Reggie also broke world records and competed in the Olympics.

Speaker 3 00:04:55.510
So I think you have a tremendous amount to offer to New York University and to the world of track at large which gets us really into this question of what is college athletics about too frequently as we read about the Woody Hayes's and the Paul Bay Bryants and big time athletics.  It appears that big time athletics including track commercial involves buying athletes buying their athletic talent and maybe they'll get an education and maybe they won't.  And too frequently the recipients of this type of treatment are black.  Black youth who can run who can jump up and shoot basketballs who get into these colleges and don't get their degrees.  Now New York University where I work in where you work as well is a first class university and it does not have subsidized athletics.  How do you then propose to build a good track team in a climate where we are dealing with students rather than paid performers.

Speaker 9 00:05:59.070
I think this is where the challenge comes in.  In fact NYU has a philosophy of that and get it out it can do more for himself for people and for NYU in such a way we.  We intend to get the cream of the crop in terms of academia rather than athletic ability which poses one problem but solves many other problems of the philosophy of some of the schools that are by these athletes as you said is to get them and process them.  And if this is go to an extreme and as you said before you find that we have about dropouts because taking something like 6 or 7 years to complete their first degree and most of not completing the last right.  They have to transfer the schools in terms of getting what do what they want out of it going to get in there for the first four years and there's nothing at all that has been accomplished we believe at NYU that if a youngster can get in the school he can compete he can can get out of school with a degree in terms of who's been able to compete poses another challenge because he has a higher degree of competition in terms of academia.  And if you look at most of our athletes today are the administrators in the field and look at the new Olympic track coach Dr. LeRoy Walker.  I welcome his who's the one who got his degree is obviously deeply right university and I'm very proud to say that I was a doctoral committee chairman at that time.

Speaker 10 00:07:34.790
Not that I had anything to do with getting his job but it just shows the type of input that a school like New York University has had into the field of athletics and physical education.

Speaker 7 00:07:43.450
And if you look at Mr. Larry Ellis who is the head coach at Princeton I mean he has been found in the tracks at NYU and look where he is now in charge of this program at Princeton and doing an excellent job.  So this is the sort of thing that NYU is behind.  If we have the youngsters with academia we can produce men which is really what we were after.

Speaker 10 00:08:02.630
And at the same time with athletes now how do you propose to get young men and women.  Because I know you're an excellent supporter of women's track athletics.  And as well.  How do you propose to get these young men and women interested in NYU so that they can continue their competitive or start their competitive track careers and at the same time do the type of academic work that's necessary to get a degree and ultimately be able to render service to their communities.

Speaker 9 00:08:35.650
I think in the first place we have to stress a song education that we give at NYU which is which has national and international prominence or recognition.  There is an opportunity for travel which which tends to broaden the horizon of the athlete.

Speaker 7 00:08:53.470
I have a youngster on the team at present who was never been out of New York and last week when we went to Annapolis to compete he came back and he was so littered about the whole thing.  I was uh I was wondering well what does what was happening here.  And here we have a youngster who has been on a need for the first time in his life.  And I just couldn't believe it.  A man at the age of 19 years has ever been on a new york notice.  What is this some of the things that a truck can do.  Plus the fact that we have to appeal to them in terms of opportunities I exposures to the Metropolitan championship that I see for years.  The National Collegiate Association championships the national a the making of the U.S. team for your country representing the countries I think is should be one of the things that each party should strive for.  This is a great thing in my book.  You have an opportunity to meet people of all walks of life but from an economic standpoint or social standpoint educationally.  And this is my appeal basically to get out there.  I can't bite on it.

Speaker 5 00:09:51.940
Now one of the things that has happened in the higher education field today and that is that practically anyone of any background who wants to get an education can because there are so many financial aid programs.  There's the state scholarship program as a federal basic opportunity grant program and as well universities like NYU have scholarship programs at NYU we have the Martin Luther King Scholarship Program which is a direct grant to the student and I believe you can correct me if I'm wrong that basically once a student is admitted to a school in terms of his academic preparation then his financial aid isn't necessarily dependent upon his being an athlete or depending upon his having a high scholastic average he gets it on the basis of financial need if he requires two thousand dollars a year to go to school in some way between the grants and the loans and the direct scholarship he is financed at the rate of two thousand dollars and is that not the way you plan to finance the athletes rather than having athletic scholarships per say.

Speaker 7 00:10:54.940
This is the way we work on the on the Princeton plan and this is the only way that we can really get out there.  Now what is the Princeton plan.  Well the Princeton plan has to do with a basically need in terms of you get the parents confidential statement you fill it out you're sending to Princeton and this all you need in terms of they take you in there and I'll take you expenses.  They find out how much you have left over for your education right.  And with that we supplement other needs of a scholarship programs inside that which would help especially the minority nobody regardless of whether you are black or white.  Once you have that basic thing for need we would get it.  In this instance you have a youngster who is who is academically son in terms of getting maybe over a thousand college boards which he has a very slim chance of getting in there.  And if you have something like to happen at the College Board and you have a very good chance.  But the fact that the financial basis or the factual background of your parents would help greatly in implementing this program but all although it's coming in now.

Speaker 10 00:11:57.360
For some youngsters or any individuals in the community wanted to contact you about exploring New York University and participating in track how would they get in touch with you.  Well I'm located at Turner Martin Washington Place on the fourth floor room for five and 10 Washington Place on the fourth floor of New York one hundred three.  What about a phone number.

Speaker 7 00:12:21.160
5 5 9 8 7 7 0 4 5 9 8 7 7 0 4.

Speaker 11 00:12:27.490
If anyone in the audience wishes to contact Cliff Bertram in terms of entering new york university and participating in track now as we think about athletics and we think about education there are so many myths about it it says that athletics causes certain students to get to school a little faster.  Some myths say it causes them never to finish because it takes too much of their time.  Some others says it causes athletes to get a big head.  Now as a former competitive matter fact current competitor and coach.  What is your view about the contribution of participation in athletics to an individual college student.  We are not talking about the champion we're just talking about the contribution of participating in college athletics in your particular instance track.  What is the contribution of that to the individual.

Speaker 7 00:13:20.470
I think depending on the what profession he wants to pursue or the degree of academia he truck truck up to greatly in terms of giving a wide scope to do and I remind you how is that you say track use a wide scope to a narrow mind how can athletic activity give scope to a mine.

Speaker 11 00:13:42.370
I'm asking that both as a rhetorical and as a direct substantive question.

Speaker 7 00:13:46.900
Well I think the thing is this that like for instance we had the young so I mentioned before on the program who has never been out of New York under here he has been on one trip has taken him to Jersey and Maryland down to Annapolis though this is in itself an experience plus the fact that making any of the national teams you will come into contact with people from foreign countries different backgrounds different cultural economic or social religious type of background.  This broadens the scope at NYU we do have such a community been centrally located in this urban community and we have people from several countries coming in here which is a melting pot of pot very type of thing.

Speaker 11 00:14:31.570
As a matter of fact most people aren't aware of it but New York University has more foreign students or students from other countries than any university in the country.  Most people aren't aware of that and that is because of its location in New York and the fact it has a variety of schools a business school at the School of Public Administration School of Social Work a school of education and arts and science school law school and so on.  So that is certainly true.  But I was really probing for something that happens introspective Lee happens to the individual.  Maybe I am not capable of being a champion but I want to run.  I want to jump.  What some of the things that happen to me as a person.  Is it true the travel and the interaction with other people are sort of side effects but why do you Cliff Bertram want to compete.  True enough.  You are a world class athlete but before you are a world class athlete I'm sure you wanted to compete because of your desire to do something involving your body and yourself.  What is that.  That's what we want to communicate to those young people in high school and college students who are in our audience.

Speaker 7 00:15:40.600
Well well with me I can I can say that I've always had a dream like a Luther King said and this was to get out until big time athletics and I would sit down and visualize daydream according to Freud and see exactly what were the pictures and I would I follow this I got a sense of dedication a sense of commitment a sense of wanting to help people a sense of not being a champion rarely off of athletics but being a champion in terms of what I can do for the next guy comes along in terms of a youngster needing help.  It gives you this this sense of appreciation.  It helps you to empathize with what people did.  The scope the psychology involved is so very different.

Speaker 11 00:16:28.820
Did the psychic makeup of the individual puts you on a different plateau or together You mean the psychic makeup of a track athlete or the psychic makeup of a champion or what happens when one is thrust into this competitive situation that causes one to begin to develop that type of makeup.

Speaker 7 00:16:46.760
Which of those things.  Well I'm speaking specifically in terms of the track athlete which was actually a person before he becomes a track athlete.  He has a certain concept of things and when he gets involved in his kinds of changes I think at NYU with all the methods courses that I've been taught and capable people at handling the situation you have more insights into yourself rarely on a socially do to isolate different things and apply it to your daily daily living which is the big thing in athletics.  You get out there not not as a champion but wanting to compete competing on experience and not that joy.  The joy of competition the joy of winning and defeat Joy is right the joy of defeat.  I say this because I remember going to the NCAA in 1962 and I was supposed to be one of the favorite in the quarter and I I blew the quarter in the first the first heat and I came back into the 220 which I'm not supposed to place and I got a medal in there.  Now I was defeated in terms of the quota.  I did not win either one for second or third but I was fourth in the NCAA is on to me this this defeat was was a joyous thing because here I was expecting one thing and I didn't make it there and I was able to come back and compensate and the guys who did beat me were very good and in an even way you're not supposed to do anything you just came out of the blue and got the medal.  I think this is the joy of experiencing defeat.

Speaker 12 00:18:19.370
Tonight on solid reason we are talking about track with Cliff Bertram the new track coach at New York University speaking of New York University and track.

Speaker 10 00:18:31.190
I imagine most of the public knows that we have sold our uptown campus and now only have a campus downtown at Washington Square and that means we don't have easy access to a track and yet you Cliff Bertram are trying to build a track team and you're going to have dozens of young men and women participating on your team now.  How are you going to develop this team without having any facility.  What type of arrangements have you made and what type of training programs do you set up for your athletes.

Speaker 7 00:19:04.530
I think that the prospects of other Don't at NYU is excellent.  In the first instance I have pretty little from an administrative point of view which is very important.  President Hester is behind us all the way.  The Dean Oliver who is in charge of the program.  He is there.  The Dan Quilty who is who is that director he is behind us 100 plus percent and we have to Afro-American Institute who's also behind us.  The public relations department also behind us the Washington Square Press is behind us.  This I think is a good start.  That is a very good start.  No looking in terms of.  Facilities at the moment it's under consideration in blueprint that the plan is right there.  We have a multi-million dollar complex coming up which will house all our varsity sports.  This would be like the the urban center of activity located in New York downtown in Washington Square is ideal.  We have a quite a large recruitment of athletes from suburbia plus the youngster who belongs to the city doesn't want to get out.

Speaker 13 00:20:09.320
If we look at the academic intake of students coming from outside it's very large and many of them live right in Washington Square and new dormitories.  Right.  Right now what we do is we use the day as a little playground at the side of Bleecker Street between Bleecker Street and Halston.  We use this for our purposes at the moment because we are of course country so to speak.  I know we preparing for indoors.  This would facilitate us at the moment when the November comes.  We'd be going up to Colombia.  The bubble has something like 9 somebody 8 degrees with all the different facilities in there.  We intend to use this.

Speaker 5 00:20:47.350
That's good a good example of indoor institutional cooperation.  Columbia owning this inflated bubble with a very fine track and making it available to a number of other universities and track groups within the city.  And it is an excellent facility.  So in that sense you're saying that there are facilities that you you ride indoors now.  Are you going to specialize in your running events your short events your long events or you're going to specialize in field events.  How do you plan to develop your team.

Speaker 7 00:21:16.900
Well the thing is this that you speak in terms of a team I know I regard a team as having several departments in terms of a field event and running events on other running events.  We have the sprinters the hurdles the distance men middle distance men under the field events.  So far we have had we have shot put us we have a couple of hurdles.  We have one poor brother who came in this week.  We have a high jumper and a broad jumper but this is this is not all.

Speaker 5 00:21:47.020
We need more people to know as you say we have a high jumper but among the thousands of students at New York University is it not possible that there are some people who can jump very well and may not have had the chance to develop that.  Are you going to encourage those type of folks to come out for the team as well.

Speaker 7 00:22:03.340
Well I would like everybody to come out.  I mean the greater the number the better.  And if you can't do something we would try to do something with you.

Speaker 14 00:22:10.660
In other words it's a teaching process join a U.S. citizen a whole teaching process which would involve your time and your wanting to do it.

Speaker 7 00:22:18.940
If you want to do it I'll teach you how to do it and maybe you could do something for yourself.

Speaker 10 00:22:22.840
Well let's speak about those time commitments because practice is so important.  Any type of activity.  What are the average time commitments for the average track athlete.  Let's say at New York University.

Speaker 13 00:22:34.690
Well what I do is I take into consideration individual differences and programs.  At the moment we work from about 4:00 to 6:00.  No but this this can vary with the individual.  If an individual has a class C a one hour break and he wants to do something he feels that he can do something in there.  I would not discourage him.  I would have him do half an hour workout which would which would help to keep him rolling until he can get something more.  It all depends on the condition that he is in now if he is that type of youngster that needs a lot of work.  Then he has to make his mind up to work longer.

Speaker 7 00:23:07.200
If he's the type of youngster that needs just trimming we trim him but the time commitment I would say is basically about two hours and varying.

Speaker 10 00:23:17.210
Now we talked about women a little bit earlier and I know that some of the greatest women track performers have graduated from New York University including Cheryl Tucson and Shelley Marshall who ran for the Adams track club in Brooklyn that was headed by Fred Thompson and is headed by Fred Thompson.  What about women.

Speaker 11 00:23:36.550
Do you plan to have a women's track team particularly in the light of Title 9 which affirmative action says at athletic facilities and activities should be made available equally to males and females and since at least half of our student body is females.  Do you plan to have a women's track team particularly to capitalize on this fantastic reservoir of talent that already is at New York University.

Speaker 13 00:24:00.040
Well the thing is just that right now we are concentrating on one on them on the male team but if the female I think straight on the males Well it's the business of administration but that's what Thailand is all about.

Speaker 11 00:24:13.210
I said for too long we've been concentrating on the males just like for too long and capturing a white people not on blacks and now he's starting a new program you say going to concentrate on males.  Q Is it not possible to also simultaneously get some of the women involved.

Speaker 13 00:24:27.150
Well we could get some of the women involved but the problem comes in here that we come under two different situations where you have track and field for men.  It's far different from track and field for women now whereas they can train with us.  The administrative work is so so very different and I think that it should be in coach at NYU.  We have quite a number of girls interested and you probably do it without you too.  That's probably right.  Yes you definitely need help.  But I handled both situations handling the men alone as a problem and a challenge to recruit them.

Speaker 14 00:24:56.620
Handling the women is also a problem of route of recruiting under a challenge until the regulations are recruiting and it goes back to that business thing you're going out there trying to buy a track athlete and I don't think you really mean that.  No not really reasons of aging students males and females who have track ability or interest in track to come to NYU I think is you really right.

Speaker 7 00:25:16.780
It's not recruiting in the sense of I get no down on buying a racehorse.

Speaker 6 00:25:20.530
I think it's very important because one of the things that I know you believe in and I know President has to believe in and certainly I believe in and that is that sports and athletics are a means rather than the end in themselves.  They provide a basis for education but they don't become the end that we should shoot for.  Professionalism isn't what we have to.

Speaker 3 00:25:41.020
Very briefly as we come to the end of our program.  The 1976 Olympics are coming up.  I'll be in Montreal and the Olympics has always had a lot of political intrigue.  Nationalism protest etc..  What do you think about that.  Do you think it's possible to eliminate politics from the Olympics or do you think this is something we should expect.  And just ride with the punch as it were.

Speaker 7 00:26:04.400
I think we'd have provided enough punch.  You'd have to you'd have to accept as it comes.  This is something that has been going on for quite some time.  I don't see it ending in the near future at all.

Speaker 6 00:26:12.470
It has been suggested for example in the Olympics rather than giving having people compete as members of countries bring all the athletes together and just give them a name or a number and they can join up and make their own teams and run their own activities like the original Olympic Games back in 476 A.D..  What about that.

Speaker 13 00:26:37.130
This may be so but I don't.  I don't like the idea because I feel that I feel a strong sense of nationalism.

Speaker 14 00:26:42.920
I feel that well that's one of the criticisms that Olympics breeds and stimulates and national competition and friction when in a one world where we're mutual interdependent upon each other we should be working toward understanding how do you.  Well I think giving those two things together because get understanding Bye bye.

Speaker 7 00:27:01.820
Like it.  I'm gonna owe an American and I want to compete for America.  I don't want to compete with say a Western kid in an Irish word team and you can do it on the Trinidad Tobago team.

Speaker 14 00:27:14.690
All right.

Speaker 13 00:27:15.040
What I'm what I'm saying is on this on this on the same team I want I want to be identified.  I want I want to belong to some to some place.  I don't want to be here there and way I want to belong.

Speaker 3 00:27:23.290
You're saying it's a question of belonging and I guess what you're saying is we don't have much time to explore it.  Is that out of this interaction you do get respect for people from different backgrounds.  Right.  And that really is what you're about.  Tonight on solid reason we've been discussing.  Track at New York University and track generally both in terms of men and women and Cliff has told us something about his beliefs about the Olympics.  I'd like to thank Cliff Bertram the new track coach at New York University for being our guest on tonight's solar reason and lots of good luck as they were all around the track.

Speaker 15 00:27:57.620
