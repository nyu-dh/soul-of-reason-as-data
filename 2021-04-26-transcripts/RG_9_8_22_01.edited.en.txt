The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture contains seventy thousand books and several thousand other manuscripts and memorabilia of Black America. A major drive is underway to gain additional support for this jewel of the Black community. Hear Jean Blackwell Hutson, chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture discuss the Schomburg on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

radio bumper intro 00:00:43.442
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:09.990
Our guest on tonight "Soul of Reason" is Jean Blackwell Hutson who is chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and everyone all around the Black community and all of Black history knows Jean Hutson and we're just glad to have you with us tonight, Jean.

JBH 00:01:23.401
Thanks I'm glad to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:25.021
And as I said in our introduction, The Schomburg is really the jewel of the Black community. It's really the torch that sort of carried a lot of us through Black history and given us the resources to do some of the writing and research that some of us do.

JBH 00:01:38.440
That's a very nice phrase to be the jewel of the black community. We're really a rough cut diamond, and we need a new setting.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:01:43.990
Well that's what we're talking about tonight. So what did you just take us right into it. There is a major fundraising effort on behalf of the Schomburg. Could you tell us about that just how it's going along and what is the structure of it is?

JBH 00:01:58.320
Well, currently we're in the midst of a mailing campaign to raise matching funds for the second grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. That has really been, umm...has won response from all over the country. And as far away as Hawaii we've been very touched by the nationwide response that has come in.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:02:17.850
I think that you know anyone who's done any reading, writing, studying, painting about the Black community knows Schomburg is probably the place to find all kinds of things. And as we were saying before we went on the air, there is so many manuscripts and other things memorabilia, that you really haven't been able to catalog and put into the best organized form, and there's so many things that you really need more space for research and and so on. So this is really what the grant is about.

JBH 00:02:50.820
Yes, the grant is not supplying us with space, it's helping us as we say to obtain bibliographic control over the materials we've already acquired and we have increased our acquisition rates especially in microfilming and preservation. But the space remains a terrible problem. That building just will not give it. Fortunately it has strong brick walls. Otherwise we would have burst out of it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:03:18.601
That's another thing that we probably should talk about tonight and that has to do with the progress on your new structure. I know New York City is in a tremendous fiscal crisis and various physical structures and the capital budget have been just ex'd out and I believe I read somewhere that Schomburg is right on the fringe there. Are you in or you're out?

JBH 00:03:38.520
Well, we must be out because we were hopeful that our architectural contract would be completed but it was canceled after the first draft was submitted last October. So, we really are quite discouraged. It looks as if that new building is in the dim far distant future.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:03:55.530
Well, you know, great miracles occur and the first of this great miracle is to get some of this money to, as you say, establish.... I like that phrase: establish bibliographic control so that when you go in you can say, we can look here and find this you, find this and so on, and put what you have in somewhat better order, if I can use that... that term and I think that's the first step. Now, there are a number of people in this world and the black community, and the white community, who are very much aware of the importance of the Schomburg, and who knows, maybe this jewel will become polished with a with a new house somewhere along the way because you're following the political route. And I think for the public, you might indicate the relationship maybe a little of the history the Schomburg and its relationship with the New York Public Library.

JBH 00:04:42.960
Well, the New York Public Library helped start--or the community I should say helped start, a Negro division in the 103-105 135 Street Branch back in 1925, and the following year 1926, some officials of the Urban League persuaded the Carnegie Corporation to give the New York Public Library ten thousand dollars to buy the private library of Arthur Schomburg, who as we say was a Puerto Rican of African descent. This seemed to have a great deal to do with the kind of library he developed because he learned about his own Black heritage, which very few Puerto Ricans did know about at the time he was growing up, and I don't know why I said "didn't know about" because I find I could still say it in the present tense that very few Puerto Ricans know about their African heritage. But he had a great curiosity about this and he was quoted as having asked his teacher why they didn't study more about Black people and she said because Black people had no history and he often said that he spent his lifetime disproving this statement, which is very interesting enough because we always think that teachers can discourage students by negative attitudes. But he was one who was stimulated by the teacher's negative attitude. Well, anyway he went to school in St. Thomas and then came here to New York and pursued his hobby of tracing the history of black people with the idea as he said of proving that Negroes had played an honorable role in any civilization in which they existed. And so he accumulated this very outstanding library which was already famous as the Schomburg collection long before it came to the New York Public Library. Well, at the time around the early 1920s was when Black people were moving into Harlem and trying to start a new community for themselves... (crosstalk)

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:06:38.071
...this is the time of the famous Harlem Renaissance?

JBH 00:06:40.171
Yes indeed. And they asked the New York Public Library to see to it that they got some special attention. And so the branch librarian went along with the community and started the Negro division which was enhanced by Mr. Schomburg's library in 1926 and began to become internationally famous. And its international fame has continued and sometimes has even been greater than its local appreciation.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:07:06.030
Well, that's true because as you walk down 135th Street, right, as I walk with people I say, you know that's the famous Schomburg. And you say that?

JBH 00:07:12.260
Yeah...

DRCB 00:07:12.921
...and they really were spurred to the fact that here such, as we use the term, jewel right in the midst of the community and so many young people black and white have not really taken the opportunity to avail themselves of this. And then of course we have that age old problem all the professors decide to send all their students to descend on you all at one time. But I think you probably, to be really honest about it, would prefer to have them descending on you by the droves.

JBH 00:07:40.471
Definitely, definitely.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:07:40.474
He does definitely have problems.

JBH 00:07:42.720
When I first went there, which was I always say 100 years ago but it was more than 27 years ago, there was an apathetic attitude toward Black history. It's been very exciting to see the development of racial pride and concern and scholarly re-examination of our history.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:08:01.671
As a matter of fact, that's one of the things we wanted to talk about. Harlem itself is sort of the world capital of Black people, Harlem U.S.A .It's more symbolic than real because every time white people move out on the fringes of Harlem, the geographical boundaries of Harlem increase and now Harlem goes all the way up to Washington Heights (laughs)...in some ways it is now known as...(crosstalk)

JBH 00:08:21.870
...Riverside Highway is known as West Harlem...... is now known as West Harlem....how about that... but it is certainly true that Harlem with its writers artists it's street corner politicians its cotton clubs and all of the various dimensions of the Harlem's of the 20s and 30s has become sort of a prototypical capital of world blackness. And I think it's very unique Schomburg is right there and contributes to this because if you look in the frontispiece of so many books written about black people so many films so many plays you see a little acknowledgment courtesy of the Schomburg almost every time I read something about blacks or see a film I see something courtesy the Schomburg. And I think it's so important that those of us in the black community become aware of this important resource and then looking toward the area of black history black history I think we're sort of up during the Harlem Renaissance at least as I read about it. It went down during the depression except for a few people like Langston Hughes and so on I sort of kept plumbing into and except you know the public works programs. All right. They've also developed great deals.

Speaker 7 00:09:39.450
That's a good point I had really overlooked that I think a number of people aren't aware of what the PDB or the WPA was.

JBH 00:09:46.230
But during the Depression where there really weren't many jobs we didn't have a federal job program said he couldn't get on a project because he had had a job but a lot of people like Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright are a whole generation of writers who came forth in the 40s I think got their professional start they will try and say as well as they were paid to write and paid to research in America.

Speaker 7 00:10:08.370
One of the areas that I know you have the manuscripts maybe not the original was the slave narratives that were done under the WPA project where they actually brought in former slaves to record their recollections of slavery. And it was very important to these people in their 70s 80s and 90s were telling about this and this gives us a live record of what the brutal period of slavery was about. So you're right. There was that but I was and really speak in terms of the general acceptance. And it really wasn't until the 60s with Martin Luther King and Malcolm now that we really got that explosion that now has culminated in black studies programs and Black Studies classes and the like. And what I want to ask you because you are right on the pulse of this because of your position in Schaumburg. Do you think that the emphasis on black history and Black Studies is as great now as it was let's say in 1970 71.

Speaker 8 00:11:06.310
I think the excitement has gone out of it but we find a very consistent use of the collection.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:11:11.640
Did I hear about the backlash but we don't see any signs of our public being diminished in any degree as a matter of fact probably as the momentum increases your public enlarges I imagine many many researchers who are doing books and special studies on various people there day after day is very into you say the excitement has diminished.

JBH 00:11:34.630
Well yeah I signed up for a while in the early sixties a little bit frantic.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:11:39.380
You know let me find out about this let me find out why the black people to hear what it like to do there. Because I was looking at it from the standpoint of scholarly excitement I think finding out a new fact or some new information about an epic or an era is one of the most exciting things that can happen to any scholar so that anytime I'm sitting in a library anytime I'm sitting reading some of the documents I'm excited. But what you're really talking about is the frenetic activity. Yeah. There was just so much going on and so many people wanting to become involved in the Schomburg now.

Speaker 9 00:12:11.890
I would guess that people who are interested in this campaign to raise funds for the Schomburg should be able to contact the Committee I believe it's called the Committee for the Schomburg Center and they are located at 476 Fifth Avenue which is where the main library and New York Public Library at 47 ST. Really. That's their address right. Yes public library. So that anyone who is interested in participating and contributing should contact the Committee for the Schomburg Center at 476 Fifth Avenue here in New York or the Schomburg Center.

JBH 00:12:44.890
And certainly the Schomburg Center and could you give the address of 1 0 3 w 1 3 5 New York 1 0 3 0.

Speaker 7 00:12:52.960
And there's is a very able staff who are very interested in getting into this and I think that it's important that those of us in the black community and those of us in the white community who are involved in black history in the study of black history should really get into the Schomburg and be there and and I say it's of support I think to all of us who've benefited in some way should and will give contributions to this particular effort. And then we need to work with our politicians if we can't get the building off the ground. Do you think that there is enough support in the in the black community itself for this building. Do you think enough people in the community who have pressure on politicians know enough about your need.

JBH 00:13:37.240
Well no I think that for a long time New Yorkers have felt that the New York Public Library was a rich organization that could take care of itself. I don't think people realize how desperate the plight of the library in general is and they think that the library ought to take care of the Schomburg but the library can barely keep its doors open a forty second Street and certainly has no resources to help Schomburg so we need to find a different avenue of support and if it could come from the black community that would be very inspiring and I think very appropriate since this was as I said a community project from the very beginning.

Speaker 10 00:14:15.470
We're talking with Gene Blackwell Hutson chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and Gene as we talk about the center. Maybe some people in the audience would like to know just how do you go how do you go about utilizing it. What kind of materials are there. What's the cause et cetera.

Speaker 8 00:14:37.180
Well first of all all we do require you to bring an ID card something with your name and address on it. Because we did find that people were using assumed names to obtain use of materials and then when we went looking for them they might have given the address of a vacant lot or didn't exist. At one time I remember I encountered a great deal of ridicule because I was running around looking for Abdulkarim who after all agents got.

JBH 00:15:10.810
Very good.

Speaker 8 00:15:11.570
These were some of the gay Yes bright aspects of the of the French 1960s people were changing their names and using materials. So we had to get a little bit more serious about limiting the use to people who were able to establish their identity and locality in which they could be traced if something disappeared and they had the use of it. But there is no charge for the use of it because it is a public facility and we're open from 10:00 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and tend to 6:00 Thursday Friday and Saturday. Hopefully we'll be able to maintain those hours at a slightly reduced from our more affluent days but we hope to be able to maintain these hours. Now in the collection in addition to books of manuscripts we have art objects and they're very significant are a very significant aspect of our holdings because many times you can trace African cultural history through their sculpture especially more accurately than through books. This of course has something to do with the parish ability of paper on the African continent but they're there.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:16:21.790
And some of those art objects just fantastic events and you can really just feel the culture because that has to do with appreciating art as well as literature you can really feel the culture through those very and this is one aspect in which black Americans have grown.

Speaker 8 00:16:37.150
I know I can I can say this honestly because I myself had to learn to appreciate African art when I first went there. We have developed the insight and appreciation that was lacking in us because that wasn't our fault entirely. We've been taught by people of European background who themselves didn't understand African art so we can. Couldn't have expected them to train us to express what I mean appreciate what they didn't appreciate. But then in addition to art objects and we have also. Before I leave that subject I should say we also have Black American art objects because we inherited their again back to the WPA the holdings of the WPA arts center which was called Harlem arts center and some of those things are being shown currently. Well we'll be yes it in the new muse which is having a show about black artists from the WPA days.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:17:31.690
That's the muse in Brooklyn.

Speaker 8 00:17:32.950
Yeah. Right. Right. Yes. And we have music sheet music and we have recordings and recordings not only of music but of speech and a very wide range of recordings even including bird calls from Africa so that all aspects of the black experience can be studied in the Schomburg. The only thing is you have to come prepared to use the materials on the premises. We do not lend anything except in unusual cases where we lend to displace of or exhibitions.

Speaker 6 00:18:09.730
And also I would assume if you come that you have some ideas what you want to find out the words.

JBH 00:18:15.040
Yes some diverse we don't advise people to lie to us and say come send me all the information you have on black people. Exactly. They will call up with the universe to tell me everything you tell me about black history in 30 minutes.

Speaker 7 00:18:31.240
And actually as serious scholars need to become aware of the particular area and define the area of course within that. Any scholar literary scholar knows that you just have to dig around you have to ask questions and your staff and somebody is really very helpful in responding to questions as to where a particular thing might be found and possibly giving leads. That's one of the exciting parts of library research.

Speaker 11 00:18:58.990
Well what about our usefulness was extended also by the publication of our card catalog. This was filmed in 1962 and we've had to supplement since then 1967 and 72 and we are now preparing well by the way in 1972 the Schomburg acquired this new name of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the time that it was transferred administratively into the research libraries of New York public before then been under the branch library system.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:19:30.970
And I think you probably have benefited by being a research center.

Speaker 11 00:19:34.380
And in some ways yes. One of the changes that occurred is that our car catalog was discontinued as of that year and the book catalog has taken its place. So we are planning now to have a print out about black materials very shortly. It may be before the end of this year but we will have a separate catalog and book catalog now.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:19:56.980
Now by having this catalog this makes it possible for a researcher to more let's go through it before he or she arrives at the Schomburg and said Well look I'd like to see this I like to see that and I believe the catalog itself is available in some of the major libraries. Hi Larry. Some of the major black energy program.

Speaker 12 00:20:14.680
I was very interested when I went to Africa to find that the Schomburg catalog was like a status symbol in a new libraries. They might have very few books but they have very good now with that.

Speaker 10 00:20:26.230
Is it possible for a researcher to write and send a check and say I'd like photocopies of X Y and yes this list these catalogs have accounted for a large part of our correspondents a great deal about reference work is now done by by correspondence Well in addition I believe you have an exhibit. Sort of a traveling exhibit. You have a major exhibit and then I believe you break it down sometimes and take it various places in the metropolitan area.

Speaker 12 00:20:52.940
Well what you're talking about is something that's in the works but it hasn't yet occurred. We now have an exhibition at the Main Library commemorating our fiftieth anniversary which will be there until the end of February. There are some suggestions about traveling it but I'm not too sure that this is going to occur. The trustees having passed a resolution forbidding traveling exhibitions because you see the risk is just tremendous a great is you have insurance problems and other kinds of problem.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:21:21.440
Yes. And of course one of the things I guess you want to do is to get more people to actually utilize the physical facility. And I say more and then I'll call you tomorrow day that I get a new facility.

Speaker 13 00:21:31.910
That new facility comprised people line up time Dan's next session on Saturdays and today and I go out to lunch because it may not get a seat comeback kid. Now we really have a our existing facility to the limit.

Speaker 10 00:21:44.390
And of course that says something about our whole enterprise and black scholarship namely that not only do we need and we'll talk about that in a moment more black scholars seriously trained by scholars but also we need more resources more places.

Speaker 12 00:21:58.820
For example I'm sure that if you had twice the area you could do twice or provide twice the amount of service in the Senate our services is hampered by this close quarter as you know we work and all over each other. And an example was when I was in Nigeria last year somebody said to me that Chandler got on my nerves and I said What do you mean we didn't have what you came for. He said no he said I had no space. This is a Nigerian who's used to space after all you know. And he said there we were a crowded elbow to elbow. You know we just don't have any private carols or anything like that where a person can enjoy reading.

JBH 00:22:36.280
So it's this reminds me of one of the characteristics of social progress that when things are really moving you are sort of disorganized and you work at elbow to elbow and then when you finally reach that status level and you get your private girls and all like that somehow and how that it seems that some of the excitement and some of the zest seems to fall off. Well I could do a little less than. A little less of that right now.

Speaker 10 00:22:59.750
Well let's talk about the question of developing black scholars. We talked about this boom in the late 60s and early 70s and the fact that things have sort of level out a little bit but still as I work at New York University and I'm sure as you see people coming into the Schomburg there is a dearth of black scholars there are not enough black scholars in many areas of history and literature and politics and so on. Each one of our major political figures each one of our major literary figures really deserves a book or a series of studies on their own and we just don't have enough people to do that. What are some of your opinions about developing more black scholars.

Speaker 12 00:23:38.210
Well I participated in a discussion of this need at the annual convention of the Association for the Study of African-American life and history in Atlanta last fall. It was very controversial in that I think Dr. Reddy proposed that we ought to have crashed P.H. deep courses for blacks.

Speaker 13 00:23:56.120
And I sort of would hate to see us have that. I think perhaps I developed a little prejudice against half baked scholars when I was in Africa because there there is a shortage of blacks. But the preponderance of professors are from India where the schools were not really developed to the academic level that they were and Africans very strange phenomenon. So you have the excess supply of Indian professors who are really not all that scholarly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:24:25.880
In other words they don't adhere to some of what we consider to be the canons of proof and collaboration and yes and documentation.

Speaker 10 00:24:35.520
When you have a war you raise a very strong point that is do crash programs gain the type of scholarship or that you need. Well particularly Black History Week has just been with us and we always look at black history in the second week of February. What have you. I have a feeling I happen to support it and participate in it but I have a feeling that we don't need black history we can unite Black History Year. In other words particularly in schools that have large black enrolments we should have intensively developed programs around a whole range of black scholarship.

Speaker 8 00:25:18.080
And of course that's really what we really try to bring out black folks white folks along to because if they knew some of the facts of black history I don't believe they would be nearly so lacking in sympathy for our struggles.

Speaker 10 00:25:33.090
No I think that's true and when I mentioned Black the emphasis on black students I didn't mean to eliminate you know opportunities for white scholars to get into this but particularly in the black community among our black intellectuals we really need to develop a certain awareness which is exist at a somewhat of a superficial level. And I think we've done a fairly good job at the superficial approach to it. Most people know that Banneker developed the first clock in the almanac and you know about addicts and they know about Drew and a few others but that really is just a a surface of black history and what we really need is the type of thing you do at the Schomburg and research as to Schomburg which is to look at a particular power and depth. I'm particularly impressed by the fact that you have the original papers of so many of the black scholars and so many of the studies which are related to blacks matter of fact that might be some fallout from this program maybe some blacks who are working our way to working on things and have their original manuscripts and don't know what to do with them. I'm sure that you at the Schomburg would be very very happy to receive them. Well indeed yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown 00:26:47.550
And by the way how do you go about getting your materials. Natalie mentioned that.

Speaker 13 00:26:51.960
Well we checked bibliography mainly but you know we were fortunate in the past that people did feel honored for us to have things that many times people would send things to us after they had completed them. We have really been kept up to date by numbers of gifts that have come to us in the past. Lately of course people are in the habit of selling manuscripts so we have a little scramble for funds and that's why the aid of the National Endowment for the Humanities and by the way I should also mention the state aid has been very helpful in keeping us in business the way the city's been treating us lately. We would really have probably closed their doors.

Speaker 8 00:27:28.640
We think that only four of our staff of nearly 40 people as is on city payroll right now you can imagine where we would be if it weren't for the support that comes from New York State directly as well as from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Speaker 9 00:27:45.080
I think that's very important. And again for our audience is information those who are interested in contributing to the Schomburg should contact the Committee for the Schomburg Center at the main branch of Public Library which is 476 Fifth Avenue here in New York City as we come to close the program. If I were if you were to react to the following question namely what is the number one priority for the Schomburg right now a new building a new you think a new building as a fire.

Speaker 12 00:28:17.080
Absolutely. We just really don't see how we can continue to exist there indefinitely. All right. I think that's a good message to leave our audience with the Schomburg is a major resource as we said at the top of show it is our jewel and this is something we have to work to preserve our guest on tonight. So the reason has been Gene Blackwell Hudson who is chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
