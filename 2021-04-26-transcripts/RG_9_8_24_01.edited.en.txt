Soul of Reason. A program that tells what's happening in Black America. Each week on NBC, leaders and movers in the Black community visit Soul of Reason to discuss important concerns of Black New Yorkers. I'm your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Adjunct Professor of Education at New York University and President of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. Tonight our guest from the borough of Queens, Mrs. Drew MacDougall, Director of the Queens branch of the new New York Urban League, and Mr. Carlisle Towery, who is Executive Director of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation. And I understand that all kinds of things that are happening in Queens, particularly in terms of the economic and social development. The recent announcement that Macy's is closing its Jamaica branch has sort of sent rumbles throughout the borough of Queens. So, Drew, as the Director of the Queens branch of The Urban League, what does The Urban League think about this and what does The Urban League think about the economic potential for the borough of Queens?

Drew Macdougall 00:01:03.510
Well, Roscoe, we can't understand why Macy's is leaving and we're- we're extremely concerned to say the least because, to us, Macy's is New York. Macy's is known probably worldwide and it had- has been part of our community with the branch. The Jamaica store has been there for as long as I can remember, over 19 years. And it's- I think the main thing is that it's- it's in the plans, while a lot of things that the community is looking forward to, the planners such as Mr. Towery, who's with us today and who serves on the board of The Queens Urban League. So we're all- we're all very concerned and really want to know why Macy's has suddenly made such a decision without any prior notice. Some of the things that disturb us most is that a lot of money has gone into plans such as a big mall at 160 Fifth Street, which Macy's had some part in planning for. It has begun or is under construction. It's aimed at improving the appearance and motivating people to shop, which would benefit Macy's.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:02:36.910
Sorry, let's get some background. The Queens Urban League, which is a branch of the larger Urban League movement, is mainly concerned with the economic development of the communities in which Black people live. And Jamaica, particularly the South Jamaica area of Queens, has a large number of Black and Hispanic and other minority residents. So I would assume this is the main reason why you're so concerned with the impact of the closing of the Macy's branch in Jamaica on the economic development of that area?

Drew Macdougall 00:03:13.110
Right. You're absolutely right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:03:14.370
What about the unemployment rate. Is there a high unemployment rate in your area?

Drew Macdougall 00:03:17.850
There is an extremely high unemployment rate. I think you probably know that the official estimate is about 40 percent for Black youth. It's probably higher because there are many who are not included in those statistics. We have a large Black population in Central Queens, which is where the Jamaica store is located. And we look forward- we look toward businesses such as Macy's and other establishments to employ our Black youth as well as our adults too. And what we're so afraid of though is that this might start a domino effect. While we're working to build up and to make it a better place and to provide greater employment opportunities, we're afraid that this might turn us around and might influence or cause neighboring businesses to also flee. And this we really can't allow to happen.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:04:19.951.0000000000291
But this is really not a Black problem. This is the problem of economic development and Central Queens-Jamaica area is a community that is not predominately Black. It's a community that has some Black enclaves, but it is still a community that has a larger proportion of white residents and a large number of merchants, many of whom have been in Jamaica for a long period of time. And Mr. Towery- Carlisle Towery, your responsibility as Executive Director of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which whenever I see development and corporation, that means money. So I guess you are the person who is entrusted with the responsibility of leading this move to revitalize the economics of Central Jamaica. That's 165th Street, that's Jamaica Avenue, that's some parts of Hillside Avenue some parts of Parsons Boulevard, and the like. So how does this fit in with the Macy's situation? Also how does it fit in with The Urban League?

Carlisle Towery 00:05:21.711
Well I think you're right that development and corporation means money and that's our entire effort is to focus public investments on Jamaica because it's a place that needs some government attention and yet it hasn't quite qualified in the past, hasn't been really competitive with other areas in the city that also need public money so it's been a major effort of ours to see if we could justify public investments first in the Jamaican area principally the Downtown because we see that as the economic heart of a larger area.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:05:58.720
That's the 160 Fifth Street-Jamaica Avenue area, right?

Carlisle Towery 00:06:01.250
Right. It's a Downtown of three, four-hundred acres in size and has two subway lines that terminate there now and 35 bus routes that come in there and the Long Island Railroad has its main Long Island station that's called Jamaica Station, as you probably know. So it's a transit hub and it's an anchor of government activities. The courts are there and the central Administration of the Queens Library is located there. So it's a it's a key part of the borough of Queens. No doubt. And it's a very, very important part of the city.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:06:35.631
What's the population area?

Carlisle Towery 00:06:39.140
Well Queens has about 2 million people and that population has been stable now since 1970. It has lost, unlike other boroughs in the city, Queens has really not lost population. It's been about stable.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:06:52.282
Although Queens is really several communities flooded in, which goes back to Pre-Revolutionary days.

Carlisle Towery 00:06:57.591
It is. Jamaica is one of-

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:06:59.330
Jamaica is one of the largest, so would you say that your population radius includes maybe a million people?

Carlisle Towery 00:07:07.370
I think you'd say a little less than a million people would say they lived in the Jamaica area and, even within that Jamaica area, people would say they live in Briarwood or St. Albans or Laurelton, but our service area, the Downtown Jamaica's shopping shared or labor pool or whatever you'd like to call it, we call it catchment area or service shared, is from seven hundred and fifty thousand to million people. You're right. And part of that includes Nassau County, incidentally. A lot of people who live in Nassau County in the western edges of it come to Jamaica for some reason or other. And so that the health of that Downtown is economic health and the revitalization of it and making it into a real heart, real solid healthy heart is is pretty important not just to those seven hundred and fifty thousand people, but to Queens. And I think, in turn, the health of Queens, which is a strong, solid middle income part of the city, one fourth of the city's population, more than that, reside in that borough. Queens has a big stake in what we're doing in Jamaica. And the borough President understands that. He now has an overall Economic Development Corporation. You ask about what's going on in Queens. That's a real positive step, I think.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:08:27.231
Let's get some idea as to how this relates to the minority population, the youth. Drew gave some statistics, which are sort of like national statistics about 40 percent unemployment. Well among your youth, first of all, what proportion of your population of the area is minority and what's the unemployment rate among those youth?

Carlisle Towery 00:08:45.380
Well, Queens has about 15 to 16 percent of its population is Black and most of those, as Drew points out, live in Southeast Queens. Most of those Black families are, I believe it's still true, it was in the 1970 census, homeowners who have moved there by choice, who made a decision to move there, who own a home, and who are people who've come there and have a stake in what what happens there. We do have a small or a problem area in the Jamaica area, where there are some people who live in crowded, bad conditions in housing and all the indices of a ghetto exist and I suppose there must be eighty or eighty five thousand low income people living in that area. That is a real problem for us and we're concerned about it and the unemployment there is very high and other problems there are very, very severe. It is, however, a manageable problem. We're convinced that with the right attention and the right kind of community input and business leadership and city government response, those problems can be handled because of the size of the problem the magnitude of the problem and because the people who live in that area are very concerned about it and very sophisticated about how to deal with it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:10:07.431
What about the unemployment picture among the youth? Because, as you describe very well, Queens, in particular, this area is a multi-economic-level community. Yes extremely affluent people including many in the business and political leaders of the city. To people whose economic situation is not really very good. What is the unemployment picture there.

Speaker 8 00:10:34.180
As far as the black youth and it wasn't very high I drew knows it better than I do. Strangely. What do you think it would be.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:10:40.330
I would say it is over 60 percent that now is that 60 percent of the lower income youth electric bill in volume because one of the things we know that middle income youth tend to go to college more and therefore are generally excluded from the employment statistics so that when you are dealing with this you probably dealing with youth who do not have the opportunity to go to college.

Speaker 2 00:11:04.130
But you are suggesting that there is a serious impact and seems to me that there is a reciprocal relationship on one hand you say that you have a large amount of unemployment among your youth particularly minority youth and the other hand you're saying that the economic level of that particular community in terms of its stores its business and so on is declining. I would imagine that this is due to the attraction of many of the suburban shopping centers and malls and many of the smaller businesses are moved out. I believe your largest business now and you makers would be ideal toy.

Speaker 6 00:11:36.990
It's the largest industry I think. But there are some major employers Gert store is a large employer the telephone company has a regional office there long island railroad is headquartered there and has a major major employer in the city government with its courts and our major employers and your college is a major employer now and in fact I think addresses is right on point with your your question about about unemployment and opportunity economic opportunities for our youth. York is the linchpin in everything we're doing out there. We are building our development plan around college and that was the first project that that started launched this whole Jamaica idea and effort about 1969 was the community's effort and it was a very very sophisticated and successful effective effort to get your college located in Jamaica. The decision had already been made as you may recall to put it in an outlying part of the borough where you were in in Fort Totten I believe where you would have to go there. You would have to own a car and it would it would not be very accessible to the to the people who need that education most. And the business community also saw York as an opportunity because in putting it at that transit hub where it could be reached by its customers and namely students and faculty you know it also would be supporting downtown and that needed activity and needed symbols and visible symbols of improvement and so forth. And not only that it would would support a transit system.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr. 00:13:12.350
Well I understand that the BMT elevated line which goes right down Jamaica Avenue all the way from Brooklyn is about to be or is scheduled for demolition which would open it up. Everyone knows what happens to third avenue when the Third Avenue El was taken down and all of a sudden it went from the street. There was a quasi low income slum street to a swanky Upper Class street. I don't know why that would happen on Jamaica Avenue but it would have I would imagine some impact on your business on the attraction of business and other groups to to the area.

Drew Macdougall 00:13:49.010
That was another you know that was another point in the total picture of Macy's. Are they aware of this. In fact within the next month the L will begin to be dismantled and it was the whole you know the plan was that this also would increase the business area.

Speaker 7 00:14:12.070
Well why are you so hard on Macy's. You know orange Macy's than a lot of things including a on Thanksgiving Day every year. And they've done a great job in their store and they're all square. They have done a number of things now as a public minded citizen. I certainly want to see every community develop and as a former resident of Queens I certainly want to see Queens develop. But when you talk to business people about business decisions they have some some reasons for their decisions. I must admit when I picked the paper and so that means we're leaving I said oh that's another element in the economic decline of the area yet they must be some reasoning behind this maybe call. You can tell us what you think it might be and also what you and people in the urban league and others are doing to try to turn this around.

Speaker 8 00:15:05.360
Well I think they no doubt had good business reasons for doing what they did. I'm not privy to those reasons and I was shocked by the by the announcement it was I think my main problem with their decision was the way they did it. If if we'd had some time to grapple with Macy's problem if they had a problem that was addressable we might have been able to change their mind or change their their conditions that that affected their bottom line. I'm sure that's the kind of decision it was. We didn't know that. And we were surprised by it and what we're mainly concerned about is that we do replace them quickly with one another with another store that is that will prove them wrong. That store is awfully small for Macy's as their stores go citywide and even nationally. And that may be one of the problems that store is exactly the right size for other quality merchants or retailers in the city and it may be that that that that was the problem. So we're very disappointed and we regret their leaving and we end it is people will read it as you read it as as a step backward. And I think the reason I'll read it that way is the way it was done. It could have been a step forward. It could have been done in such a way that Jamaica would have it would have been clear that it was not a problem of Jamaica. It was a problem of Macy's merchandising strategies and that then another merchant picked it up and moved it forward. So we we are committed to to responding in a way that will not damage the downtown and as Druce pointed out we have enough commitments there the our removal in this mall both of which are big environmental improvements and new subways being built Dr. Brown as you may know that Second Avenue Subway was curtailed unfortunately. But the archer Avenue subway is going ahead and it's a little bit behind schedule but it's being built with a brand new station right in the downtown and right at York College and that's going to be increased access for the population of that area to jobs to cultural and economic opportunities. So we have transportation being built there as well and then we have parking we have some parking going being constructed right now and we have land for office development we're very much committed to office employment as a as a part of Jamaica's redevelopment and we hope we can get the private sector and the government sector to respond to that opportunity to put jobs right at this transit hub right at a place where these people who need it most can have access to it. And so we have a major plan and I think in the down the road five six years there'll be some major visible evidence of improvement and these interim problems we lost the long island press.

Speaker 3 00:17:57.550
You have a lot of problems that tonight on so the reason we are talking with Ms Drew MacDougall who's director of the queens branch of the New York Urban League and Carlyle Tower who is executive director of the greater Jamaica Development Corporation and we're talking about the revitalization of Queens. And is Carl I was just saying you just have a endless list of problems that go out of these shifts in population and grow out of the economic crisis that we face now. Drew. What is the Queens Urban League doing in other than its advocacy role. What kind of training programs are they running for youth. What type of counseling programs what type of cultural programs are they doing. Because the Urban League nationally is a major catalyst in dealing with social change. So what are you doing in Queens.

Speaker 10 00:18:46.780
Before I answer that Roscoe I'd like to just end up on you ask what are we doing about Macy's. We haven't given up on them and in fact we're in the process of mobilizing a local and national campaign to try to change their mind. All of our 109 branches all over the country are sending telegrams into Macy's. The NAACP joined us in this effort as well as other organizations. So we hope we can change their mind on the matter of jobs and other activities. Our biggest thing is employment because we feel the base a job you know is the most important thing and we have an active employment program. We now have an OJT program on the job training program which will train some 200 people on the job. We're planning other types of employment programs. Under President Carter's youth employment bill in the area of recreational activities we really try to work with other organizations in the community to develop these kinds of programs specifically now we're working with the Southern Queen's Park Association on the St Albans Park complex that which was federally owned at one time has been turned over yet also in neighborhood yes. Right. That piece of property has been turned over to a local group which the Urban League is on the board of trustees and we're attempting to develop that into a recreational center for the youth of Southeast Queens cause this is really traditional with the Urban League's Catholic Road.

Speaker 3 00:20:42.360
You'll meet you're training 200 people. I thought boy that's just a drop in the bucket of the tens of thousands of youth in that neighborhood and people who need to be trained. Yet as I hear what you're doing with Macy's and I hear what you're doing at recreation some of the other things that is really traditional with the Urban League and so the public can get an idea of exactly what you have to work with how large is your staff at the present time. We have two people.

Speaker 9 00:21:06.830
All right. That's it gives you the the the problem that advocacy organizations face. I won't ask the Mr. Tower how large his staff is but I imagine he has somewhat the same kind of problem we do. Yes. We're nonprofit just as the Urban League is and we are. We spend a great deal of time trying to convince foundations and government and corporations to contribute to us. That's that's our sole source of revenue as contributions. Just like just like the Urban League. But isn't the gut problem in the central Jamaica's all over this country. These communities that were well used at one time middle class flourishing business people moved to the suburbs. The businesses go with them. The general economic level of the community declines not a lot but little. The business practices just such things as the language spoken in the stores the type of merchandise is stole that solve. Example I happen to have been in the Jamaica Branch of Macy's in a long time I thought it was a pretty stodgy store. Now mazes would probably want to challenge me on this. But the point is that there have been some changes and it seems that when you go to the suburban branches it isn't just Macy's many other large stores. They are merchandising practices so different and so modern. Yet you go back to the older neighborhoods a little stodgy. So maybe one way of looking at this is that this type of change. And personally I always view change as providing opportunities rather than problems right. Maybe this type of change provides it for men this opportunity to bring in some new thinking to revitalize this whole area because one of the things and change is people try to hold on to the past as they are trying to move into the future and that really your hands to rise to to pull you back sometime. We need some new thinking on just to stick with a whipping boy here they may say we need some new thinking with every time we do it.

Speaker 7 00:23:06.750
We have remember they do a good job at Thanksgiving. They certainly do. They do a good job another I'm not sure that helps the black. Oh it certainly does. I think that I think certainly they they interest and to be totally fair to Macy's it really is symbolic of the type of economic problems that you face. It just so happens that they are very pivotal at this time and they are a good corporate citizen as Drew says they are.

Speaker 8 00:23:29.540
They are New York. And that's why we are so hurt really by the way they did this and disappointed in that way. But but I do think and not to single out Macy's in this next comment. But we do need new thinking as to how you merchant has the LA how the larger stores merchandise with urban populations as a vast opportunity for for retailing in New York City from every market study you look at there's tremendous opportunity for for for retailing. I'm not a retailer but I can read market studies and but but a lot of the stores do not know how to do it and they'd rather be in the cheaper suburban locations because that worked for them in the 60s and it's not going to work pretty soon because there is a real energy crisis whether the merchants want to really admit it on their customers or the population in general. And you're going to find the downtowns in this country and many of them the marginal areas now and I think Jamaica is somewhat typical of that throughout the nation as you as you suggest October. I think you're going to have to find new thinking and I think all the investments the infrastructural moneys that have been spent by governments have really changed downtowns in this country and are gonna they're gonna come back but it's gonna take some new thinking you just can't run away from it. You know it's a finite country we've got you can't keep moving away from the urban problems and the urban opportunities because the profits are there and I think there's a big black market.

Speaker 9 00:25:02.630
Well I think cars that are very well wherever they are people and they have needs that you have consumers and the role of business is to reach the consumers. And one of the things that you've noticed even in something like radio with the success of WB Ellis them not only do you serve the black community which is quite common. And it becomes an important merchandising tool for everyone. And that is one of the hard lessons that white business America needs to learn.

Speaker 8 00:25:31.160
I do think I do think though Dr. Brown just that it is not purely the private sector. All right that's where we'll get our move into. Government's got to to favor it has got to give some priority treatment to the cities. I can't believe we've survived in and in the city of New York and in places like Jamaica. Through the past eight years under the administration we had where the programs were clearly not geared toward urban development and yet we still the city still were viable because they are so populous they are so accessible and there is so much investment and so much at stake and so much energy and so much energy now.

Speaker 5 00:26:08.750
Talking about the theory and right now I have taken a new responsibility and runs community colleges. The president and city university system having come from the private university where I still do some work on your college Yale College is part of City University system. So the university is in a major financial crisis. It has 18 19 units as in a lot of talk about not lending York develop as rapidly as some other place. New York is having some problems in some instances keeping its enrollment up. What are you folks in Queens doing to help support York.

Speaker 10 00:26:44.740
I'll start with Drew. Well we've been involved quite a bit with York specifically at one point in attempting to have it remain as a four year college. We were very insistent upon that and successfully got that commitment but now it's faced with a campus problem and in fact the president President Basson addressed our board last night and we are beginning to work out some strategy to meet with the mature authority to see if we can get that campus moving because that's the crucial problem or money.

Speaker 9 00:27:24.080
It's all right. The reason why the campuses and capital of budget budgets are not moving is because we haven't been able to move bonds in the bond market and we haven't been able to make bonds in the bond market because of this overall economic picture. So it's a cycle total circle that we're going through. Carla what are some of your ideas about your wallet.

Speaker 8 00:27:42.920
What we're trying to do is give the public the facts. That's the first thing. And let the public make judgments on it. It is a public institution but a couple of facts that are important. York is in its own right important as an educational institution and has a special role. It serves an unserved area that is crucial to the city's health and that can be that can be easily documented with statistics and maps and we can show the role that York is playing geographically and an educated elite. And but apart from that York is economic development. It's not just a college. And it is much much more. It is economic development. It is it is saving a tax providing part of the city. Jamaica right now still have to recalculate it with Macy's departure and we hope it'll be a temporary departure but a temporary loss of tax revenues. But today Jamaica provides more taxes than it consumes and York is stabilizing a tax providing part of the city. So we're working with the Urban League and with other community groups just to get those bonds floated so that we can we can go ahead and build Yorks campus.

Speaker 2 00:28:53.870
Very briefly Drew what can the public do to help the Queens Urban League.

Speaker 11 00:28:57.810
Oh they can support us in terms of memberships first of all we are a membership organization and we'd like their memberships. Now they get in touch with you which your address. Our address is made to dash 20 Union Hall Street Jamaica New York 1 1 3 1 1 4 3 3. What is telephone 2 9 7 7 2 7 2 that's 2 9 7 7 2 7 2.

Speaker 3 00:29:21.490
For those interested in the programs and activities of the queens Urban League. Our guest on tonight so the reason have been Miss Drew McDougal who is director of the queens branch of the New York Urban League and Mr. Carlyle Tower who is executive director of the greater Jamaica Development Corporation. And we've been talking about the very significant issue of development and revitalization of Queens. This is Roscoe Brown saying so long for solar reason this program is produced by the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University in association with NBC.
