This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:00:48.900
The main plank in Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign was full employment. Yet nearly a year after his election, the unemployment rate in the United States is still over 7 percent, which means 30 to 40 percent in the Black community. On tonight's "Soul of Reason," we will discuss this important problem with Lillian Roberts, who is Associate Director of District Council 37, one of the most important labor organizations in the city, and herself a leader for full employment. Glad to have you with us tonight, Lillian.

Lillian Roberts 00:01:17.821
Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:01:20.550
As we said at the beginning of the show, things really aren't going very well in terms of full employment. As I can assess at this point, Jimmy Carter hasn't really delivered on his campaign promises. And as the looting that accompanied the blackout this summer has shown, people really are edgy, people really are poor, people really do want. And despite all the allegations that people should have just sat back on their hands and not stolen and so on – I don't think people should steal either – the point is very clear that there is a lot of economic misery in our country and in our city, and the week of September 4th through 10th is what is known as Full Employment Week, headed by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King's widow, and many of the most prestigious labor leaders in this country. We're trying to mobilize and focus on the need for full employment. So as one of these leaders, how do you think we can get full employment in the United States of America?

Lillian Roberts 00:02:26.050
Well, I think that we are going to have to change our direction. We can't just look at full employment without looking at what it costs us not to have full employment. For instance, one person in jail costs fifteen thousand dollars a year. One single person on welfare costs two thousand five hundred dollars a year. One person who is hospitalized, because of perhaps poor health due to nutrition and other matters, costs over two hundred dollars a day. Now we complain about these things separately, but they all contribute to the fact that if our money was used a little differently, perhaps we could have full employment. I think we have to assess everything. It's hard for me to even deal with crime unless we deal with full employment.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:03:19.260
I think everyone who's walked the streets of our inner cities is clearly aware of the fact of the close relationship between crime and economic conditions in those parts of the city. True, there always is a small portion of people who will be involved in crime regardless of circumstance. And we know that there's a lot of white collar crime in this country. It probably costs a heck of a lot more than the so-called street crime. People are afraid of street crime, of course, because of the physical circumstances surrounding it. And I too admit that I would be afraid and am concerned about that. But the main point is the relationship of poverty and various criminal acts. But when you talk about changing priorities and so on, you're really talking about turning around a country, a society that at one time was based on a three percent unemployment rate. Then it became supposedly acceptable for four, and then five. Now we're riding a seven, and as we know it has been as high as almost 9 percent within the past couple of years. How can we really make this move? Does this really mean more investment on the part of government in public service jobs or does it mean more incentives for private industry? The classical economists say, "Well, if we sit back and wait long enough, the law of supply and demand will take over, and people will find a need for new products and they'll start businesses in life." But this doesn't really work anymore, because we are no longer in a labor intensive economy.

Lillian Roberts 00:04:46.950
Well, I guess that will work if a number of us will be killed off as a result of people not having work. I mean, with the crime, you know the death rate goes up –

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:04:57.632
Crime, and then a few riots and a few other things.

Lillian Roberts 00:04:59.801
That's right. And so maybe that's what they are waiting for. I would not like to wait for that. I think that when we talk about needs, you know, we have youngsters that don't read, and yet teachers are walking around with holes in their shoes. And we talk about education and placing a value on it, and that's losing its value too because of unemployment. We talk about when going to school to become a nurse, and yet nurses are walking around also unemployed, you know. So we have to concern ourselves with the needs of society. And then those persons who have the professional know-how would have employment, in addition to those who are supporting staff would have employment. I'm very concerned that we are not doing a lot of things socially. I think that we as a society have to show that we care about each other. If we don't then nobody cares about us. And we're saying to the people who are not working and who are not part of what is happening. Who do not have goals and aspirations, because they don't have any reason to have them. They don't have money so they can't think about, "Well, next week I may be able to get myself some furniture, be able to save toward a car, or toward a home." They don't have any dreams. And when they don't have any dreams, then our dreams are gonna be dashed. And I think if they had – if we had jobs and had social programs, they could feed into that and begin to care more about each other. And I mean that in terms of even the elderly. If we had programs where our youth that are in high school could be responsible for going by and seeing that there were groceries in the homes of the elderly, or going with them to the clinics and wherever they have to go, there would be sort of a relationship there. They would begin to build relationships that are absent sometimes from the child and the parent. And there would be a service rendered at the same time. There's so many things we can do to plug into each other, to show that we care about each other. That's what it's all about. I think we are losing that rapidly.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:07:05.370
I think you certainly are right. The whole question of the reciprocal concerns for each other has disappeared partially because of the anomie of urban living, but also because of just the despair so many people face. Yet as you describe these programs, practically all of them seem to revolve around government funding. And many of the so-called critics of government funding are saying, "Well, look, you put it into another political pork barrel and people get paid. They don't show up for work. All you're doing is doing for people what they should be doing for themselves." I don't believe that personally, but how do you refute those arguments? How do you really justify moving large segments of money to employ people under the auspices of government? Is that a move toward Big Brotherism [sic]? Is that a move toward controlling people overly in the society?

Lillian Roberts 00:08:08.670
No, I think that if a person has a public service job, they earn a certain amount of money. They're able to buy some of the commodities that produce jobs in the private industry. And we've got to start from that base. And then as the demand occurs, then of course the company will expand their staff, which would mean private employment.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:08:32.309.9999999999418
You know this really is the principle behind– it's one of the big arguments, by the way, about how to get full employment. One theory which more or less comes out of Keynesian economics is that you put money into government to help stimulate, as you say, new jobs. And then people will have the need for consumer goods, and then that will stimulate the consumer business. Now the classical economic theorists say you don't need that, because there's a certain amount of waste and loss, both in terms of loss of incentive and also loss of efficiency. Yet we're not getting very far.

Lillian Roberts 00:09:10.140
I think that was disproved when they laid off the city employees, and it hit the businesses, who were screaming, you know, "We want their heads. We want them out of jobs." And then after 60,000 people lost their jobs, they found out that they were having problems sustaining their staff and many of them closed. So, I think that the theory of generating revenue through public– And I think there should be some tax adjustments for private industry right now.I'm sure that they are having problems because the public doesn't have the money to spend. So, I think you have to have both. But it's got to start somewhere. And I think if it started with the public service and with some tax adjustments, that they probably could meet, and we could have full employment. I don't think there's any such thing as we can't. I think it's costing us too much not to have it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:09:58.501
Well, I think certainly your emphasis is on the fact it is costing us a lot. And if we can have it, there are two issues that we really should focus on. The two things we should focus on: The way in which the National Committee for Full Employment is approaching this is to thrust all of their energies behind the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill, a bill which has been in Congress for almost two years now, co-sponsored by Senator Hubert Humphrey, one of the great leaders of our country, and the Black Congressman from California, Representative Gus Hawkins. There's been a lot of quibbling back and forth about Humphrey-Hawkins. It doesn't provide enough, it doesn't give it to the right people, etc.. What is the position–your position, and possibly the position of the committee on this? Are you standing foursquare behind Humphrey-Hawkins? Do you think it needs to be modified? What do you think about it at this point in time?

Lillian Roberts 00:10:53.210
I would be standing behind it. And I think that we could spin our wheels, there's nothing perfect. And it's a start in the absence of an alternative. I'm behind that bill because we need the jobs. We need to stop the jargon and move into some action. I'm very concerned about what happened Wednesday night. Very concerned. I think that that was just a warning. And I think that when you get thousands of people caught up into something, we better be listening to what is being said to us. And I'm really very distressed about all the jargon and no action.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:11:28.310
Well, one of the things that's distressed a lot of people, particularly the Black community who really gave President Carter his plurality that got him elected, is that the Carter administration hasn't really done anything other than provide a few public service jobs to deal with the economic situation. The suggestion is that they have to stabilize some other things. But Carter spent a lot of time on human rights, particularly in Soviet Union, which is interesting and I would support, but not very much attention to rights over here, particularly the question of jobs. What do you think it is? There's not enough political pressure on him and his advisors? Or is it that there isn't that much of a commitment to deal with it? How do you evaluate this?

Lillian Roberts 00:12:15.350
I would hate to be totally negative, because, after all, it's less than a year. And already, whether he's moved as forcefully as we'd like to see him move, he's moving more in this short period of time than I would say the Ford administration. But I would like to see him move much faster in this job area. And from what I hear of his welfare reform program, I'm very concerned. And I'm very concerned because maybe he doesn't understand, and he's got to understand. If that means that we have to be in the street to make him understand, then maybe that's what we have to do. I think that presidents and leaders all respond to pressure. And if his welfare reform program means that the [unintelligible] moneys and the food stamp moneys and all the other moneys that go in for the poor are pooled together in order to give jobs to welfare recipients at minimum amounts of money, the minimum wage, and to supplement it– Well, then, it means that many people will be on welfare all their life, and I don't want to see that. I think that people should be given jobs, because they're given their dignity when they have jobs. Nobody wants to be on welfare. And to have people who are on welfare the whipping boys of this society I think annoys me, because there's a lot of people on welfare because they have no job, and they're not proud of that. You know I've been on welfare myself. I never was proud of it. And I think that when we don't address ourselves to it, we're preparing for generations and generations of people who will have no other way of survival. That's all it is. And to be on welfare– And some of them and their breaking out of it will show in many different negative ways to society, because they feel that they have been wronged. So I hope that there will not be such a reform bill that is not going to do what should be done in terms of just outright seeing that people get jobs. I think that's an answer to it. His welfare reform may take place when people get jobs, it may very well prune itself down to a very few people, with mothers and children who are trapped there. He may find that I would like for him to deal with that job issue first, and then he may have less to deal with.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:14:27.482
Tonight on "Soul of Reason," we are talking with Lillian Roberts, Associate Director of District Council 37, affiliated with the National Committee for Full Employment. The week of September 4th or 10th is full employment week, and everyone in the audience is urged to be alert to this, to write to their congressperson, to call television and radio stations, and to accelerate the demand for full employment. And I believe the focus now, as we were saying earlier, is on passage of the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill. Which really suggests that there should be a deluge of letters and telegrams and phone calls. A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that the White House number is listed in the phone book. You can call information, get the number. You can call the White House. And a lot of people call the White House on things against us. And basically those of us who are in favor of certain things, particularly full employment, why don't you call the White House and let it be known? And I think one of the roles of media and programs like this is to alert the public to the fact that, yes, we too – no matter how economically deprived we are – have an avenue of contact. We can call our congressperson, we can call the president. Pick up the phone and call the president. And tell him, say, "I want you to support the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill." And that's something it is perfectly legitimate within the Democratic frame of reference.

Lillian Roberts 00:15:48.201
Absolutely. And I think the same people who took their time to go out and vote for Jimmy Carter ought to let him know how they feel about it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:15:55.740
And that's one of the reasons why people like William Roberts are so important. Well, let's go back to this whole question of welfare and welfare reform. Allegedly, the largest part of the welfare bill is to support dependent children, children whose mothers have no other form of support in life. And many people have looked at this. Probably the most odious and negative has been the so-called Moynihan Report, where they said that the reason for this is that Black families are single parent families, and they're just running up our welfare costs. And even some vague suggestions that maybe we ought to be doing some sterilization and a few other things. Obviously that's far from the truth. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of dependent children. In your view of an ideal reform approach for, not necessarily welfare, but for providing a better life for these children and these mothers– How do you think this could really be approached? Because they've tried the work incentive program where welfare mothers and others are given special training. The problem is that many times after they finish the training, because of the employment picture they weren't able to get jobs.

Lillian Roberts 00:17:13.960
Not only that. Sometimes it stigmatizes them. I don't like any program that takes a group of people and says, "You are indeed special." And maybe people in their own minds, because of the way one talks about welfare, thinks that they are failures and loses before they even get started, which is most unfortunate. I think the best thing in the world would be to– Particularly in public service jobs, you can take individuals in as trainees and in full-time employment. And then as the private sector opens up, they can find their own way from there. And they should be paid the same wage as other workers. There should be no distinction, because that gives them their dignity and integrates them into society, and that's what we really want. We shouldn't have a string onto them forever more saying, "You're welfare, you're treated differently." I mean, nobody really wants that. I don't care what nobody says. I'm never convinced of that. Nobody wants it. And that's what I think should happen, that they should be– They should be the ones, really, to receive those public service jobs, because they could get the training there without any kind of differences shown to them. And then from that point they can move wherever their ability would carry them. And on many other public service jobs now, in spite of what people say, and I think the politicians find it very popular to use the public servants – although they are one and they're out of the same pot – to talk about pensions and to talk about all other things, but they never talk about cutting their own. And so I get a little annoyed about that, because the people who work in public service, I think, are great people. And the reason they are is because they get all of the people that no one else wants to be bothered by. They must service and they do it very short handedly. And you will not find among the masses a great deal of help. You may think that you will, but you won't. Sure, there's some ways. And I think that that's attributed to politics, because it depends on how high up you're going to be appointing people in the staff. That's only as good as its leader. And so if we are going to have people moving around, and appointing commissioners who don't know what they're doing, and placing them over people who have been there a long time, trying out different things and by the time they start getting into their little experiment, then they change offices again, it's going to have an impact. And I think what we need is more civil service up to a higher level, so that we could have a stabilized workforce, so we could deliver better services to the public. I've always felt very strongly about that.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:19:41.660
Are you suggesting then by your statement that the commissioners of the various departments should come up through the ranks? Or are you suggesting that maybe people almost to the level of commissioners should come up through the ranks?

Lillian Roberts 00:19:53.888
Those almost to the level of commissioners. I'm a realist and know that every politician wants to have his own man, you know, in a position. That's all right with me. But I think we have to have stabilization beneath that, and we need to have somewhere in the upper ranks people who come up from the ranks, who are fixed in civil service positions, so that we don't have an awful dramatic experience with individuals coming in and not knowing that we've gone through the trial and error period, starting all over again, costing the public. I think that's one of the real illnesses in New York City. We have training programs that we were able to get through collective bargaining. And it's because the union realized that it is the continuous workforce. And we must have training programs for our people, so that they can use their ability to move forward. And we've had people who have once been on welfare and other things that have gone on to training programs, who have become nurses, who become technicians, who have gained a great deal of dignity. Not only for themselves, but their families then are able to see a hero. You know, we don't have enough heroes in our community. Always see somebody else that's not working or somebody else that is considered by this society as nothing. And I think that everybody has something to offer. I can appreciate the person who cleans the street, because I like to walk down a clean street. So that person has his value as far as I'm concerned. And if we all begin to think about that, then some of the jobs that are supposed to be so onerous has a certain amount of dignity to it.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:21:26.613
Of course I don't think that people think the sanitation job is onerous anymore, because I believe when they announced the job the last time, they had over one hundred or two hundred thousand applications. Because of the impact of unions, jobs like sanitation jobs have become very desirable jobs. One of the problems that is now being addressed is, I read somewhere that by nineteen eighty-five, one out of every five people employed in the country will be employed by government. That's by city, state, and local. And what they are suggesting with that data is that for a comparable job, public employees get paid about 15 to 20 percent more nationally.

Lillian Roberts 00:22:13.152
That's not true.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:22:13.841
This was a study that came from The Conference Board, which is a group of economic analysts. I don't know whether it's true in New York or not, but there is some feeling that for comparable work, the public sector pays better, because when a public union bargains, they are bargaining against the tax base, whereas a private union may not even exist in some instances. You had suggested that in this public service job approach, that many people would start in training positions, and then they would work into the regular position, and then they may go to private industry. Given the fact that there may be a differential, particularly in terms of not just salary but sometimes benefits, is it really realistic to expect that after people get onto the public payroll, that they are going to transfer in large numbers to the private payroll?

Lillian Roberts 00:23:09.460
It is realistic, because I'm not talking about police and firemen and sanitation workers, who are not necessarily in private industry. Those are the ones who perhaps may be making more money than as a security guard at a plant somewhere, you know. But when we talk about a clerical or hospital worker, these salaries are higher in private industry than they are in the city. Maybe not so much with the clerical work – it depends on what level they enter – but if you're talking about secretarial skills, and things of that kind, they are higher. And these are the people that we represent. And I guess I must speak to them, you know. But I guess at this time, that's really not true that they make so much more money. And if it was one out of five, to me it wouldn't matter if people are working. And I don't think it would be one out of five, because, again, I think it would stimulate business, and therefore they would be employing many of the people that would otherwise be with the public sector.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:24:11.890
Actually, it isn't necessarily a negative thing to have a significant segment of your population on public payroll. You've probably been to the Virgin Islands or some of the other Caribbean nations where 60, 70 percent of the people work for government. And if one of the purposes of government is to provide services for people, that's not necessarily negative. I think the real problem is that in a society where, an economy where so much of what happens is a function of how many automobiles people buy, and how many refrigerators they buy, how many television sets they buy– It's like a domino effect. So that if you don't buy as many automobiles, some automobile workers get laid off, and they don't buy as many cosmetics, and so cosmetic workers get laid off, and the whole circle. And ideally one of the principles behind Humphrey-Hawkins Bill is that there will be some indicators which would enable government to make decisions as to where they would prime the pump with various types of public service moneys and tax incentives. Somehow or another, some economists find this repulsive. I think the main reason is that it takes away part of the freedom of their statistical models, because they say things sort of just manage to work themselves out. But I've always had a feeling that when you say 7 percent unemployment, that means 7 out of 100 people, and that means that one of– It probably wouldn't be me, but it could be, that I might be one of those seven. And to what extent in a society do we really allow the poor to underwrite the whole economy of the society?

Lillian Roberts 00:25:55.370
Well, I just wonder, and I can't end without asking the question. When we talk about the jobs, how many of those jobs are in other countries that could be here? And what business has contributed in terms of bringing about this issue, and now they want to talk about it? You know, I can't help but think about many of the clothing and tv's and cars and what not that are produced abroad and brought over here from us to buy. And I think one day they're going to find there'll be nobody buying them because we're not working, we're not making them.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:26:28.040
I think one of the things that you pointed out earlier, and that is that the looting that accompanied the blackout during the summer really reflected, in a sense, a warning sign, that you have a lot of people – obviously a certain number were involved in crime anyway – but aside from that relative percentage, you have a lot of people who just took this as an opportunity to reach out and take some of society's goods. Because they're responding in a sense to Carter's statement sometime earlier this summer that it's – I'm talking about the abortion bill, where poor people couldn't pay –he said, "We know that the world is unfair. We know that rich people and better-off people are going to live a better life than poor people." But the real question is how much better and to what extent should the livelihoods or the lives of the well-off or the affluent be built upon the backs of the poor? And that's why anything that your committee can do in terms of Humphrey-Hawkins is important. Are there any particular activities you have planned for the week of September 4 through 10?

Lillian Roberts 00:27:31.060
Yes, we are going to be asking our members to send telegrams to Congress asking to have that bill passed immediately.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:27:37.700
And also maybe some people in the audience might pick up on an earlier suggestion to look up the watch line number for the White House and call and let them know that significant numbers of people in our society are concerned about full employment and want to support the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill. And as you suggested, even with its imperfections, you believe that the bill should be supported.

Lillian Roberts 00:27:59.090
Absolutely. In the absence of alternatives, we can't quibble over a period and a comma.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:28:04.220
And of course, some people say it isn't just a period or comma. It's a question of how many people get how many jobs, but the principle–

Lillian Roberts 00:28:09.122
Well, we can go from there. Let's get started.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:28:11.700
Okay. Well, of course, I can see why you're successful as someone active in the labor movement. Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Lillian Roberts, Associate Director of District Council 37. And we've been talking about the whole issue of full employment in our society. And the need for everyone to support the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill and other bills that will be produced and presented to improve the overall economic picture for people in our inner cities and in our nation as a whole. Thanks again, Lillian, for being a guest on tonight's program.

Lillian Roberts 00:28:44.931
Thank you for inviting me.
