Only two percent of those employed in the field of journalism are from minority groups. Here, Pat Patterson, editor at large at "Black Enterprise" magazine and instructor in the Association in Education for Journalism's Summer Institute for Minorities, discussed this important issue on tonight's Soul of Reason.

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:38.890
This is Soul of Reason, a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. Soul of Reason is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:01:05.110
Our guest on tonight's Soul of Reason is Pat Patterson, who is editor at large at "Black Enterprise" magazine and has been very active in the field of journalism for minorities, trying to find out why minorities are discriminated against and providing the training so that more of us can get into the field. It's really good to have you as a guest tonight, Pat.

Pat Patterson 00:01:24.160
Thank you for having me, Roscoe.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:01:26.410
Let's get into the statistical picture. You say two percent. Could you tell us something about how this two percent is distributed, and also other than the obvious reason of racism, give us some reasons why there are so few minorities in the journalism field?

Pat Patterson 00:01:42.430
Well I think historically Blacks have not been in journalism generally you know, largely because of the discriminatory pattern in the past. And I, of course most Black journalists came on the scene during the eruptions of the 60s and there was a spate of hiring. And I think particularly in the mid 60s when the qualifications for getting a job would simply be Black, well that obviously has stopped now and we do see a better trained and more Black journalists entering the field. But still the fact remains that despite a tremendous influx and numbers, that is of Blacks, we still only make up two percent of the entire journalism field.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:02:43.800
Now is this Blacks or is this Blacks and other minorities?

Pat Patterson 00:02:46.900
Blacks and other minorities. So I suppose if you would separate out Blacks alone you might have something like 1 1/2 percent.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:02:57.271
Well now where are they distributed? For example when we talk about the field of journalism we are talking about newspaper reporters, we are talking about the radio news people, we are talking about television news people, talking about people who write for the news magazines, in the news weeklies, and I guess you are talking about some of the people who have public relations type responsibilities with the various business and social and governmental agencies.

Pat Patterson 00:03:20.660
Right. I suppose in sheer numbers, just in terms of numbers, Blacks or Blacks and minorities are better represented in print, that is newspapers and magazines, although the number for magazines is pitifully low. They are more visible on television. But here again they, there is a certain amount of visibility, but in terms of numbers, that still is quite small. So the the the larger number of Blacks you'll find on newspapers. But even here when you figure that papers like the "New York Times" or the "L.A. Times" have upward of 300 people on their staff and maybe about 10, 15, perhaps 20 Blacks on their staff, you can understand that we still are underrepresented even on these papers where there has been some considerable hiring during the past.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:04:30.380
Now getting to the end of the cause and other than the general idea of racism, which certainly is a major factor, what are some of the other things subtle and otherwise that tend to keep more minorities from getting into the journalism field?

Pat Patterson 00:04:47.530
Well I don't think it's so much subtlety anymore. I think in the beginning obviously Blacks were not encouraged to enter the field simply because there were no jobs. But during the last five or six years I suppose there has been a tremendous increase in the number of Blacks entering the field of journalism. And I suppose simply the lure of television itself with its enormous appeal. And it's, frankly it's a glamour appeal in many instances has attracted a number of Blacks. But there was a study not too long ago that said that, that concluded, that one of the reasons most journalists, Black or white, enter the field of journalism is to make a change. I mean they really don't do it for money. It comes out of some kind of sense of idealism and a need to change. And I think that whereas the jobs are limited in majority media, it is my hope that perhaps some of this training will be reflected or some of this new interest in journalism among Blacks, minorities will be reflected in a stronger minority press which I think is essential to the future of my community.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:06:13.001
Matter of fact that was the next question I was going to ask because you said that Blacks have not had a long heritage in the press, immediately I thought back to John Russwurm's "Freedom Press," which is the first Black newspaper and--"Freedom Journal" he called it--and Frederick Douglass's "Northstar," and Monroe Trotter's paper, we talk about the Vanns and the Murphys, and all those great Black newspapers, the "Couriers" in the sense that, the "Defenders" and the Afro-American chain, and our own "New York Amsterdam News," Powell and then Procope. So there, and I believe there are some, what two or three hundred Black weeklies around the country.

Pat Patterson 00:06:56.510
Yes there are.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:06:57.551
Headed by the, what is that, the Association of Negro Newspaper?

Pat Patterson 00:07:01.090
National Negro Publishers Association.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:07:04.011
Yeah Carleton Goodlatte heads those, so that there is some affinity for the use of the press, of the written word, to project the message and concern of Blacks. The problem which I think you're relating to is that despite all of these numbers the Black press is still relatively weak.

Pat Patterson 00:07:21.790
It is relatively weak.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:07:23.170
The press depends upon advertising, it depends on circulation. And most Black people still get their news from the major white daily in whatever urban or suburban community they live in.

Pat Patterson 00:07:35.730
And I think one of the real problems with that is that we frequently get a distorted picture of our communities. Now sometimes that's not always intentional. On the other hand sometimes that bias is intended. But I think that the only way in which the many needs of the Black community are going to be realized and satisfied is if that, if we have a stronger communication vehicle which is controlled and directed by people who are intimately concerned with those problems, which turns out of course to be Black people.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:08:17.000
Well this would suggest that one thing that Blacks might do, is to do the kind of thing that inner city broadcasting has done with radio to take a couple of radio stations in this instance. You have in New York City WLIB and WBLS FM which really are Black controlled but because of the way in which they are programmed they begin to influence larger audiences. Of course part of this relates to the use of music, which really isn't exactly news, but conceivably Black control of one of the major dailies might help. I think the largest Black publishing organization is Johnson Publishing, and "Ebony" is a targeted publication, which is the main publication, "Jet" is a targeted publication, Ida Lewis's "Encore" has tried to cover a wider publication, a wide readership, but generally their readership tends to be a little bit more closely a Black readership. What can we do to get some Black control of some of the major news sources?

Pat Patterson 00:09:22.840
Well I think the argument becomes circular, Roscoe. The publishers obviously need the advertising to improve their product and they cannot improve their product without the advertising so it becomes a kind of circular question of what comes first the chicken or the egg. But I do believe that if Black publications are to attract the kind of audience it needs, number one in terms of circulation, and two in terms of advertising. It simply has to improve its product and obviously that means better trained young Black journalists who are willing to come in and to work on Black newspapers and somehow that accommodation must be met by the owners and publishers of Black magazines if that's going to happen. The reason I say this, that is this, that there is in my opinion not a single influential Black newspaper in the country, and I say that with a great deal of sadness because I think that particularly in our major cities where considerable amount of that population is Black and minority that there is no communication vehicle which influences the policies and strategies of the office holders. And I think until and unless that situation has changed that I'm afraid that Blacks will be in the same dependency situation that we've been in for so long.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:11:14.941
Now one of the things you've been active in for the past four or five years is the Association in Education for Journalism's Summer Minority Program which is run at New York University in conjunction with the Journalism Department and our own Institute of Afro-American Affairs. What impact do you think this program has had on dealing with the problem of minorities in journalism?

Pat Patterson 00:11:40.020
Well I think it's been a very good program as you know and I think that a great deal of credit must go of course to yourself and to Dr. Lionel Barrow, who is the Dean of Communications, School of Communications at Howard. The program in my opinion has been extremely successful not only because of the minority students who participate in the program but because of their commitment to seeing change. And some of course will have elected to, have indicated that they want to go back in the minority press, others want to go into majority press but almost all of them want to go on in either media to make a difference. They believe they can make a change. And I think that the youngsters who come through that program are committed to better minority representation.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:12:40.620
For some young people who are listening and people who have been trained in journalism, maybe you might identify how they might go about actually getting a job where they might follow up some of the possibilities? I know you have a couple of particular ideas on this but could you develop those for us?

Pat Patterson 00:12:58.890
Well I think the first thing that any young journalists should do is to to know where the jobs are, and too often those jobs are not New York or San Francisco or L.A., but that they should be first concerned about getting a job perhaps in a small town or somewhere outside of a major city. They do not need to start at the top. Obviously they should be well trained. And I think that if they were interested, and if they were interested in a specialty, that they should concentrate in that area. They should concentrate on urban affairs or labor. And I think that if they bring a particular skill to a newspaper they have an opportunity of a better opportunity in being hired than if they were simply a general interest reporter.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:14:06.330
We're talking with Pat Patterson, an editor at large at "Black Enterprise" magazine about opportunities for minorities in the field of journalism and how the journalism field itself can serve the minority community more effectively. And one of the things that I'm interested in is the development of these new wire and radio service type organizations serving the major press, but also serving a sense of the Black community. And I'm thinking of things like Community News Service which I understand is having some problems and may be going out of business. National Black Network, Mutual Black Network. Do you think these type of services helped to get the position of the minority community across better? Do you think that they will be able to survive? For example CNS is already in trouble. National Black Network is at least moving along. Mutual Black Network, which is really a subsidiary of a larger white owned corporation, seems to be serving a lot of Black radio stations. What do you think about these developments?

Pat Patterson 00:15:13.580
Well I think they are good developments. Unfortunately because of the enormous amount of capital that's needed to put these services together, Blacks have not been operating at anywhere near optimum. But I do believe the market is there. And unfortunately an organization like Community News Service which is in deep financial trouble and has been operating for some years may have to fold because it has not been able to get the necessary funding. But the service itself obviously is a good one, and a much needed one, but it has not been able to get the support of enough backers because of their shaky financial situation. Now with the radio wire services I think we see a little better picture. National Black Network is doing well. They were funded at a reasonable level, financed at a reasonable level, and they are now doing well and they are looking forward to some expansion. Mutual Black Network News of course has, is doing well and that too has been largely because it's been financed properly. So I think there is not only a need but a continued need for such services.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:16:55.520
Well you know the example that you just gave about Mutual Black Network and National Black Network and the success of your own magazine, the magazine you were affiliated with, "Black Enterprise," the success of "Ebony," the success of "Essence," which is a Black woman's magazine, suggests that the Black press or the Black media that are targeted mainly to Black concerns and are marketed properly, are going to be successful. But it doesn't seem to deal with that other problem you're talking about, and that is media which are Black controlled, have Black input, and present the Black perspective, which cover the larger population. Do you think that's going to be possible?

Pat Patterson 00:17:42.200
Well I think that a publication, or any media effort that's directed towards the Black community, can succeed if you have all the proper ingredients, that is the three M's: money, management, and the market. Now obviously there is a market for Black publications. I think "Black Enterprise," "Essence," and "Ebony" have demonstrated that fact. But then too we need to have the proper amount of funding. You just simply cannot start on a shoestring. I think those days are over by and large. And then of course there's a much needed ingredient, management. And I think that if you can get that proper combination that you're going to have a successful product. I think that the Black market is a dormant market. It is a market that needs to be cultivated. And I think it will be, will appreciate considerably in the future. And I think it, anyone who is perceptive enough to to understand the dynamics of that market can be very successful in any venture not just the media venture but if he is, he or she is-- understands that market and its potential that they can realize a very good opportunity.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:19:22.540
Well one of the things I know that you do is you teach the course in journalism and minorities for the Association in Education and Journalism Summer Program is to plan with the students so that they produce a magazine.

Pat Patterson 00:19:36.490
Right.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:19:36.610
I believe this year, what's the title of this year's?

Pat Patterson 00:19:38.170
"Kaleidoscope."

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:19:38.173
"Kaleidoscope." They have names, it's been "Genesis 1," it's been "Spectrum," it's been "Still Here." And again that's part of their experience. The students in the program select the name of the magazine.

Pat Patterson 00:19:49.941
Well that's the whole idea. It should be not the magazine of some former class but the magazine of that class. It should reflect the ideas and the perceptions and the wants and the simply the feeling of that particular group of students. They have produced that magazine. We were fortunate this year to get the services of a few professionals who have agreed to help design the magazine and to shoot for the magazine. So it has taken on what we've always been working towards, that is to a melding of the professionals and the students. And this year, well as all years, we managed to get a number of really top notch Black professionals to come down and speak with the youngsters, like Les Payne of Newsday, one of the few Black Pulitzer Prize winners, came down to chat with us. And Gil Noble of course was there, and Annette Samuels of Community News Service, so we've had a variety of people who have come in and tried to share this experience with us. And that's another thing that these young people get exposed to what the real world is all about when they are allowed to rub shoulders a little bit with some of these top Black professionals.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:21:13.930
I think it's interesting for the audience to note that the participants in the Summer Journalism Program for Minorities come from all over the country, and they're not only Black but they are Native Americans and they are Chicanos, they are Puerto Ricans, they are Asian-Americans, and they are selected from some, I believe this year was 280 applicants from the various journalism departments throughout the country. Which really means you have the cream of the crop and as we said--

Pat Patterson 00:21:41.140
Super youngsters too, they really are very good.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:21:43.540
And many of them have gone ahead to be in the media. Just recently I was in Washington, D.C., and I heard a reporter giving a report on the radio and who was it but Paula Quick, who had been in the program three or four years ago and it, and I was also in a news conference and one of the other young people, I forget the name right now, came up to me to say, "Hi. You remember me from the AEJ workshop?" So this suggests that people like yourself, and organizations like AEJ, an institution like New York University, can do something to help develop a pool of skilled journalists. Now the fact is that they're probably a much larger pool of skilled journalists than they are job opportunities. But again you're suggesting that quite possibly creative management and creative planning can pull these people together so that we can produce more publications that will meet the needs of a minority community and as well the majority community. Because my view is that the majority press is served well by having minority people who understand truly the minority situation on their staff.

Pat Patterson 00:22:57.320
Well Roscoe that's absolutely true because what we're seeing throughout the country is one and two paper towns where before we used to have five or six newspapers, we now get all of our information from three networks or two newspapers. And usually those, that media is owned by a single entity. So we are seeing a kind of monopolistic control of the media now. It's up to now it's been benign by and large, but still it has not been totally representative of the various ethnic and racial groups in many cities. And it seems to me that if, with programs like AEJ in which trained really skilled young people can come out and begin to exert some influence in the world of journalism, that we're all going to be better for it. And instead of being fed the same kind of news from the same sources with the same restrictions, despite however well-intended they might be.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:24:12.610
I might mention if anyone in the audience is interested in the AEJ Summer Internship Program they should contact the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University. The address is 70 Washington Square South, New York, 112, and ask for information about the program. One of the things that I know that you're doing and I know in my capacity as director of the Institute I'm doing is to publicize the program more, let people know about both the need and the success of the program so that we can get more sponsors. Because the way in which the program works is that the young people come to New York and they work with various media organizations, that we place people at "Women's Day" at Fawcett Publications, at "Newsweek" magazine, the Call Buyer Associates, Equitable Life Associates. We've had interns at the National Urban League, at Community News Service, and a variety of media organizations like that, and the more sponsors we have, the more we can serve the needs both of the minority students and the minority community, but also the needs of the majority newspapers, the majority radio stations, the majority group magazines because I'm really glad that-- [crosstalk]

Pat Patterson 00:25:26.981
I think that I can only say amen to that Roscoe because I don't really think that without such programs as the AEJ which is one of two minority such programs in the country and--

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:25:41.171
That alone is a disgrace, of course.

Pat Patterson 00:25:42.281
Which is really a disgrace because most of the young Blacks do need some kind of assistance in getting through school, number one, and they do need some particular help in finding their way to employment. And the program does that, and I think it's a very narrow view of the, that's taken by some business groups when they reject an opportunity to participate in this kind of program.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:26:18.820
One of the things that I've found in attempting to sell a program to various sponsors is that someone says is it sort of a poverty program, you know doing things just to help minorities because it's a good social thing to do. And the point that we've tried to develop and some of the majority group media people who've worked with us have tried to emphasize, is that it's good business for a majority publication to have minority people on the staff and to train a large number of minority people because this gives them a larger pool of qualified people to select from.

Pat Patterson 00:26:51.771
Absolutely, and I think that the business community must reject this whole sociological view of assisting those who have historically been disadvantaged. I think that the same, that's the same sort of thinking is what contributes to the deterioration of our cities because they think not in terms of a productive person but rather in terms of some dependent person. And until that kind of thinking is no more I'm afraid that we're going to continue in our same situation.

Dr. Roscoe C Brown, Jr 00:27:25.830
Well again as we come to the close of program, what advice would you give to young people who want to, minority young people, who want to enter the field of journalism?Well,  I think they ought to give themselves a little extra. I would suggest that they attempt to specialize in something and so that they get their foot in the door. If they are trained as, in political science or as a movie critic or book critic, or they know urban affairs, I think they ought to give themselves an edge which gets them through the door and brings, they bring a special talent to that paper. And I think the, that publication or that network would be eager to hire them. Again spoken with the excellence that Pat Patterson has brought to our minority journalism program at New York University. Our guest on tonight's Soul of Reason has been Pat Patterson, editor at large of "Black Enterprise" magazine and instructor in the Association in Education for Journalism's Summer Minorities Program at New York University.
