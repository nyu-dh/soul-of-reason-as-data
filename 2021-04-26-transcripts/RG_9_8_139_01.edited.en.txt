"Flashback", "Captain Blackman", "The King That God Didn't Save", "The Man Who Cried I Am". What do these titles have in common? They are all works from the pen of John A. Williams, one of America's foremost Black writers. Hear him discuss his new book "Mothersill and the Foxes" on tonight's "Soul of Reason".

Bumper Intro 00:00:41.930
This is "Soul of Reason", a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:08.840
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is John A. Williams who is very well known for his writing about the Black experience. And as we mentioned at the top of the show, his titles are legend throughout the literary community. Glad to have you with us tonight, John.

John A. Williams 00:01:22.791
Thank you.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:23.901
And from that very, very busy pen, in addition to your work as Professor, Distinguished Professor of English at LaGuardia College and the City University, you've been working on new book which has just been published. The title is "Mothersill and the Foxes", which immediately leads me to ask the question, how did you come up with this name Mothersill? The book is about the relationship between Black men and Black women and love and so on, but the key character is Odell Mothersill. Now where in the world did John A. Williams get that title from?

John A. Williams 00:01:53.840
Well I grew up with a guy named Odell. That was his first name. Mothersill is, used to be the name of an old seasick remedy. I've only met one person in my life who had that name and I was so taken with it that I guess I've carried the title with me for several years. And if you're talking about seasick remedies, you're talking about people who are going up and down and, in a way, that's what the part of Odell's life is.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:19.491
Because apparently he was, if I can use the expression, sort of a super stud and going in all types of adventures with all types of women. [crosstalk]

John A. Williams 00:02:27.961
Okay I'll make a correction. He thought he was a superstud.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:31.462
Right, right. Well, that really is now, why don't you explore that because that basically is what the book is about. It's set around Cleveland, the Hough section; set around New York, Greenwich Village--

John A. Williams 00:02:41.514
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:43.110
NYU.

John A. Williams 00:02:44.081
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:44.084
I noticed you've mention a lot buildings [unintelligible]

John A. Williams 00:02:45.632
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:47.512
Could you develop that? Would you say he thought he was a super lover?

John A. Williams 00:02:51.620
Yeah, well I'm trying to explore, let's say, a Black male ego in which a man does believe, or think, he is a superstud. But it's this very ego that leads him into all kinds of traps and situations in which he's ultimately proved to be not the superstud he thought he was. In a sense, very vulnerable.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:16.160
Of course he was a professional man, a social worker and he got tied up with a lot of other professional types. And unfortunately in much of the Black professional community we've been sort of led into being teachers, preachers and social workers which really means that somehow now that it's expected that we're going to pick up the burdens of the group and solve their problems. And given the fact that we live in a predominately racist society, we expect superhuman feats of our professional servants, our social workers, our teachers, our preachers, our lawyers and then this man, Mothersill, trying to act out certain beliefs or fantasies that he had about himself in terms of his sexual potency, his ability to make it as it were. At the same time, undoubtedly, he was having some deep seated misgivings about himself as a person.

John A. Williams 00:04:09.801
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:10.581
How do you, how did you develop that? How did that come through, not necessarily the story, but how did that come through in development of Mothersill's character?

John A. Williams 00:04:20.450
Well I think there is one basic premise in that Mothersill being a social worker, a particular kind of social worker, a children's social worker, could see through his experiences that within this society, children were being raised badly, poorly, so that within his own mind he saw himself as the father of many children who would be raised properly. That is to be filled with love for themselves and other people; to turn the society around, to create a new society. And this was one of his drives that got lost within the superstud ego. I had worked with--

00:05:03.832
What is he a modern day Rousseau in a sense?

John A. Williams 00:05:05.870
In a sense, yes, in a sense, with all the psychological, sexual overtones and myths and so on and so forth. But it basically is through the children that he hopes to achieve a new kind of world. And I agree with that, because I think you've got to start somewhere, and it's not with us.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:27.171
That's true. On the other hand, as he did this in terms of his misadventures or adventures with women, he was in a sense tearing down the very thing he was trying to build because a society with men and women, Black men and women, there has to be a certain degree of mutual respect and understanding in order for not only the present generation, but for future generations to develop.

John A. Williams 00:05:52.250
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:52.641
And if you destroy that in your women and in your men and in your children, then the future you're trying to build is being built on sort of quicksand.

John A. Williams 00:06:04.130
Yes, that's true, except that you can't expect these qualities to be in every individual and that's a part of Mothersill's search. I agree. I think, you know we've, we've been raised in a culture where love is the ameliorating force for everything. I think love plays a small part in the relationship between a man and a woman. But I think that trust and confidence mutually expressed is, is really the basis for any goal that a couple would have.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:06:38.480
Some of the other writers, some white writers as well some Black writers, have been developing that point recently, that Americans in particular and although Black people have basically an African heritage, they have assimilated many characteristics of American culture, have almost a frenetic drive for some type of romantic love and fulfillment, 24 hours a day, 352 days a year, every year of their lives. And as such, many of the interactions, legal or otherwise, between males and females fall down because they don't go to that next level which is being persistent in terms of trust and understanding.

John A. Williams 00:07:19.460
Right. They don't have any substance to them. No substance.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:23.810
And when this gets tied in with political situations it becomes much more difficult.

John A. Williams 00:07:29.331
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:29.992
Many of the radicals, both white and Black radicals have been into situations with women and with members of the same sex based on a kind of love relationship covered with an ideology.

John A. Williams 00:07:43.311
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:43.314
And then when the love falls apart, the ideology falls apart--

John A. Williams 00:07:46.012
That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:46.016
And there really is no no thrust [unintelligible] I think seen in terms of several of people who were killed up in Attica and some of the other places, where as you read their letters after they were gone, there was always a searching back and forth for the security. Now this raises the interesting question, at least to me, and I know a number of Black men are talking about it now, and that is what is the effect of the Women' s Liberation Movement on the relationship between Black men and Black women?

John A. Williams 00:08:19.850
I think in most cases the effect is minimal. I think women's liberation appeals most to a certain quality of Black middle class woman.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:31.522
A la white middle class women.

John A. Williams 00:08:33.441.0000000000582
White middle class women and a very small minority of Black middle class women.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:38.570.0000000000582
In other words you're suggesting, as I know some women we've had on the program in the past have suggested, that the Women's Liberation Movement really is not a movement, at least in its extremes that relates specifically to Black women.

John A. Williams 00:08:51.680
It doesn't. It's like most other movements in America which have been started by white radical groups. Does not really encompass the Black experience for women or for men. And I think anybody who comes out of a Black family has some idea about, some very firm idea about the position of the female within the society. Now that of course stems from the racist situation in this country that the woman had a firm place and it was not necessarily a place to be looked down upon by the father, because very often the woman had to get out and work and bring in her share to keep the family together. I think the whole idea of equal respect for both men and women, without discussing it too much, without too much examination, has always been there to a larger extent than in the white family groups.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:56.390
It's certainly possible that as you were talking, here we are two Black men talk right now that say we might well be falling into a chauvinistic bag ourselves--

John A. Williams 00:10:06.340
I don't--

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:06.832
On this, because one of the things that I hear as I talk with Black women is that many feel that Black men do not respect them emotionally. They lean upon them. They use them. They benefit from their enterprise. But when it comes to close one-to-one relationships that many Black women seem to be dissatisfied with the way in which the Black man uses the Black woman, a la Mothersill, in a sense, although he had an ideological purpose to cover up his basic psychosexual drive.

John A. Williams 00:10:48.661
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:48.664
But that is a feeling that many Black women who are examining the relationship between Black men and Black women have.

John A. Williams 00:10:58.130
Well, of course I'm not any more of a position to say whether it's truthful or not than you are. My information comes, I suppose pretty much the way yours does, from well-defined cultural group. We rarely get out and deal with the masses, who have another view. And I think it's one of mutual respect; husband and wife. We're, we're in New York which is isolation and the people we talked to have no, have very little relationship to the people west of the Hudson.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:36.290
That's probably true. You know there's New York and the rest of the country.

John A. Williams 00:11:39.641
That's right. That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:40.430
And not only that, among our own or anyone's personal interactions, they are in a sense limited to certain groups of people whom you relate to day by day. On the other hand you do hear, and again you have to evaluate very carefully what you hear when you don't have data, that there is a syndrome in some parts of the Black community where Black men abandoned families. Now it can be analyzed by the fact that the racist society tends to castrate them--

John A. Williams 00:12:12.211
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:12.403
Occupationally, and the welfare system makes it important for them to abandon them. On the other hand, one does have to examine what other, first of all what is the truth, and to what extent is a large factor. Some research I've read tends to suggest that the allegation that Black families are falling apart all over the place really isn't any more true now than ever was it. Whereas in certain instances--

John A. Williams 00:12:39.431
Yes. That's that's my impression.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:40.790
These disappearing type situations. But what about that? One thing is how do we counter that? But does, for example, a book like Mothersill perpetuate this? Although he does kind of very tragic end at the end of the book which we will leave for the readers to discover.

John A. Williams 00:12:58.701
But it's not a tragic end.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:00.233
Oh, OK.

John A. Williams 00:13:01.250
No, he, he finds his woman. She's pregnant and they've adopted three other children. So he has his work cut out for him; the start of the new society that he wants to build. It's a, it's a kind of an upbeat ending. But let me go back to the thing you were saying about what people are talking about, women claiming that they've been badly used by by men, Black men. A part of this, I believe, comes out of the society, the larger society, that racist society which is always filled us with myths. The historical record would show that, and I'm not saying this to excuse whatever may or may not be happening, but the historical record shows, and it's continuing today, that in terms of this particular society, Black women have always had greater advantages than Black men. Now we can see it in the job situations in New York. Let's take my field. I don't know how many Black editors of senior status are left in this city, but we have large numbers, not, well, a significant number of Black female editors. Now when the Black literature fad passed, Black male editors went with the fad, but Black females are still with us. We also know that historically when it came to a choice of who is going to school and who's going to stay home and plow the field, it was the sister who went to school and not the male.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:43.221
Of course, as you look at that, sexism does come into it in part.

John A. Williams 00:14:50.391
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:50.681
And that women generally are lower paid. So therefore, an intermediate level technical position, entry level teaching position, et cetera, the society is more apt to take a woman than a man because of unequal pay. Now fortunately, one of the benefits of the Women's Liberation Movement is to move toward equal pay. I think that practically every person regardless of their identification and some of the other aspects of the liberation movement, does identify with the concept of equal pay--

John A. Williams 00:15:18.791
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:19.081
For equal work because that's almost like a union that wants to have one set of scales for Blacks and another set of scales for whites. It is not even enlightened self-interest to perpetuate that. That's one aspect of the movement that I think everybody identifies with and probably as affirmative action and other programs take hold, if they ever do, we will see more men, Black men, moving into certain positions because no longer will it be advantageous to hire a woman, a Black woman, at less pay.

John A. Williams 00:15:52.750
Yeah, but we'll have to see though, won't we, because everybody's gotten so slick right now that in order to meet the regulations, it's very easy to hire a woman who is Black and so on and so forth. And you've got--

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:06.992
Covered two points.

John A. Williams 00:16:07.991
That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:08.502
With one, aside from the sensitivity that some people are having, the general community, about affirmative action. Well as you look at Black writing today and you've used an expression earlier. I made an observation that the day, the heyday of Black writers is past, or, the period where Black was in has passed, which I think is consistent with what's happening in every particular field. If you talk about Black being in, you're referring to special attention to Blacks to help remedy the centuries of oppression and neglect.

John A. Williams 00:16:45.700
That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:45.703
I think that particular part has sort of passed although as a result of the initial impetus, there are Blacks in many many more fields than they were before, but given the fact that publishing companies probably aren't publishing as many Black titles, they think they've caught up, quote unquote. What really is happening in Black writing today? I mean there are people like yourself and John Killens and Baraka and a few others who are still being published and people like Ishmael Reed who are breaking through.

John A. Williams 00:17:16.453
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:18.40.999999999883585
But in general what's happening, or do you perceive Black titles are being published in significant numbers? Do you see that readers really want to read contemporary Black literature?

John A. Williams 00:17:32.110
I don't think they really want to read it. And this includes Black readership too, because everybody's been indoctrinated with the myth that every Black novel is a protest novel.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:41.830
That's a very, that's a very good point. I'd like you to elaborate on that because that is one of the key problems in Black writing.

John A. Williams 00:17:49.181
You mean the lack of Black readership?

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:51.041
Lack of Black readership and the stereotype that you mentioned--

John A. Williams 00:17:54.701
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:54.703
That is assumed that every Black novel is a overtly protest novel.

John A. Williams 00:18:01.121
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:01.123
Now if you talk about the Black condition, and we are basically oppressed people in a sense, then anything you write about is about oppressed people, but whether it's a protest novel or protest essay or protest poem, that's something that certainly--

John A. Williams 00:18:14.442
Well you see, a lot of the literary rules don't apply when it comes to Blacks. If we had developed in America, which we did, a great naturalistic school of writing which is writing that shows the effect of the environment on the characters, and we come along, we do the same thing, that's protest. If Upton Sinclair did "The Pit" and "The Jungle", that's something else. That's great muckraking. The rules just just keep changing, but the fact is that the Black novel in America has never been of one particular category. You could take Jean Toomer's "Cane" (1923) and measure it against Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises" (1926) or whatever. There's really no comparison in terms of the language, the thrust and the whole business.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:05.890
Toomer is one of the most underwrited of...

John A. Williams 00:19:08.002
Underrated, yeah.

00:19:09.132
Underrated. That's true.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:11.822
Underrated writers, Black or white--

John A. Williams 00:19:13.452
That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:14.072
And that's reflective of the general feeling of literary criticism as well as the time when he was writing.

John A. Williams 00:19:20.591
The feedback is obviously that the man did not get that much support. And now this has happened with a great many writers, and failing to get that support, I assume he just went off and quit. And it's very hard to stay out there rowing that boat if you don't get a little wind to help you, especially if the lake is so big, you know, those white waters. But then the Black novel keeps changing. Basic messages are always the same. That is, a kind of humanity must be searched for and secured, in different guises. Bill Kelley has become highly experimental; very, very good stuff. Killens is about as solid as Gibraltar. His theme is always the same. You know the works change, but the truths are still there.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:11.781
And particularly, in his recent book, "Cotillion". He looks at a facet of the Black experience--

John A. Williams 00:20:16.072
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:16.551
With a certain amount of humor and poignancy that can't help but make anybody who reads it--

John A. Williams 00:20:21.112
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:21.891
Just laugh right down to his boots and at the same time begin to examine some of the values that come about. And as we were talking before the show, sometimes when we begin to explore the realities of Black socio-political life, even in fictional characters, the sensitivity of Blacks, and probably there's a good reason for it is so high, is that it sort of discourages the writer from exploring those themes.

John A. Williams 00:20:49.060
Well, no, I think there'll always be exploration and I, just because the fad seems to have passed this time doesn't mean, as far as I'm concerned, the end of Black writers or Black writing. We'll always have them. And also, we are a very important tributary in American literature. The record shows that everybody steals from us. To the Jazz Age; the music that was created from jazz music, Stravinsky, Hindemith, all those people; the painters Braque and Picasso; Vachel Lindsay, Van Vechten, Ronald Firbank. Carry that up to the Beat Generation when they was doing the same thing. We're very important and I think we know of our importance. It's very hard to convince readers and critics that we are indeed here and will remain.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:46.401
Well, in order for any field of art to flourish, it has to have some place to grow.

John A. Williams 00:21:51.531
Right. The gallery is a place where the visual artist demonstrates his work. The jazz club and the concerts are where the musician does his work. The film, the cinema, is where the cinema artist does his work. The writer, he has to be published. That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:07.072
And that raises a question. Other than the major companies who publish books, what are some of the outlets? We started at New York University, this magazine "Black Creation".

John A. Williams 00:22:16.941
Yes, I remember. It's very good.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:18.620
It has gotten some respect and acknowledgement, but right now it's an annual because of just the economics of publication. There are a few other Black literary publications around, but where can and does the average Black writer, particularly the average young Black writer, get a chance to get his or her stuff published? Because that's what it's really all about.

John A. Williams 00:22:40.701
That's, that's what it's all about. There aren't too many sources, and this leads quite naturally to the most pressing need for Black writers and that is Black publishers who obviously are not going to play the faddish game. Now there are number of individual Black publishers around the country, small, hard pressed economically, and so on.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:04.420
And like Broadside Press and [unintelligible]

00:23:06.311
Like Broadside, like Emerson Hall, like Third Press.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:11.360
[unintelligible] Press. Now that's one place now.

John A. Williams 00:23:14.971
Well, I don't think, I don't think that as individuals they're all that effective. I think if they could come together in some kind of consortium, publish more books, have more capital, the effect would be just, just outlandishly good. And that's, that's what I think Black publishers need to start doing.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:38.310
Now the largest Black publisher of course is Johnson.

John A. Williams 00:23:42.411
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:42.771
And for years they have continued what was really a "Negro Digest/Black World". But, again given the nature of the readership who like pictures and flashy stories, you don't really get a lot of the penetrating analysis, even from a large publisher. And to give them some credit, I think that "Black World" has published some interesting things.

John A. Williams 00:24:06.440
Yes.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:06.891
But the extent of which may be some of the really creative things that are being written depends [unintelligible] Black writers to get out. Apparently they don't get out through our major sources. Our newspapers certainly don't publish them. Our little literary magazines, like "Black Creation", do publish some.

John A. Williams 00:24:26.811
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:28.791
It's almost as though these community type activities, community publications, community workshops do more in the way of getting things out than the major publishing press.

John A. Williams 00:24:42.650
Yeah, but what the small outfits do is make the writer hungrier for more, and there is, there are few sources where a writer extending himself, say from "Black World" to a book length work, can go. Now I think Johnson, as you pointed out, a large publisher, has really not pulled the weight that I think they should have in terms of getting good books before the public. But if Johnson, Broadside, Third Press and so on and so forth got together Howard University Press, book publishing of Black books could be helped immensely, because it's a real problem, because we don't have any real sources.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:26.390
I think it's an important point and also it underlines something that I found when I first began to do artistic literary criticism. People said when we first started our television program on Black literature, how are you going to get enough to cover 30 weeks, though obviously you've got enough to cover 300 years.

John A. Williams 00:25:42.022
That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:43.190
And as the more you probe into the depth of Black writing, the more you find there is available and that puts increasing pressures on the publishing industry--

John A. Williams 00:25:55.582
Yes. Let us say to open these vehicles, and I would concur that it places increasing pressure on the Black people who are involved in this. Also I, if you want to look at it from another point of view, I think that more Black people as well as white people should actually rather than just knowing the title of a book, go to the bookstore and pick it up, and read it. That's right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:16.464
Not just the old standby, you know the old Afro-American literary course.

John A. Williams 00:26:19.252
Right.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:19.521
You had "Soul on Ice" and you had Malcolm and you had some poems by Baraka. You had Baldwin and you had Ralph Ellison, "The Invisible Man" and you had a Black literature course. Now it so happens they are all very fine books, but to suggest that you can cover the panoply of American Black literary life in five or six or seven volumes is absolutely ridiculous. And even anyone, Black or white, to accept the fact--

John A. Williams 00:26:46.762
Yeah.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:47.481
That they are educated people with that limited knowledge of the Black literary experience is [unintelligible]

John A. Williams 00:26:53.480
Well you know, people--. There's a very obvious fact here and that is that the Black literary tradition is about as old as the white American literary tradition. Two hundred years.

Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:06.620
Of course it is. And we emphasize people like Phillis Wheatley, but there have been other people who wrote, and wrote very well--

John A. Williams 00:27:16.100
That's right.
