It is generally acknowledged that Black writing is the most creative development in recent literary history. Hear Professor Addison Gayle of Baruch College discuss the exciting world of Black literature on tonight's "Soul of Reason."

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:34.412
This is "Soul of Reason," a program that will examine the roots of the Black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by the WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University, and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Junior, Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:01.290
With us this evening on "Soul of Reason" is Professor Addison Gayle, who is Associate Professor of English at Baruch College of the City University of New York. He's a well-known writer, a well-known critic, and we're going to be talking about the status of Black writing today. Glad to have you with us on the program tonight, Addison.

Addison Gayle 00:01:17.190
Thank you, Roscoe. Glad to be here.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:19.501
Now let's talk about Black writing. We said at the top of the show that it is the most creative development in recent literary history, and I think the reason why people feel that is that it's sort of just being discovered. There's always been great Black writing, but more recently in the '60s and '70s, it's really just being discovered. So what are some of the things that are happening in Black writing today that tend to bring about this excitement?

Addison Gayle 00:01:44.370
Well I would think for one thing that Black writing has moved away from the old traditions, in the sense that Black writers have, by and large-- and it's very confusing so that you can't really make, in a-- you can't draw a clear-cut diagram. For the most part, Black writers are not writing the traditional protest novel. Secondly, Black writers are less attentive these days than they used to be to all of the traditional academic concepts, which in a sense, defined out Black literature, i.e. universality, etc. And I would suppose, third, that Black writers have begun to realize that, by exploring the Black experience in total, one comes up with a literature that deals in terms of Black people, much more so than, say, literature of Jesse Fauset or William Stanley Braithwaite.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:45.121
Of course, the role of literature, the arts in general, is to communicate to one's fellow man, the feelings, and the passions, and the concerns, and the hopes, and the aspirations, of the particular cultures that the writer comes from.

Addison Gayle 00:03:01.174
Of course.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:01.176
It's very difficult to write about something-- to write insightfully-- about something you don't know anything about.

Addison Gayle 00:03:07.084
Of course.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:07.086
You could write a newspaper article, then you report it. But if you are a writer, or a poet, a short story writer, an essayist, you're writing about something that you live, and feel, and breathe. And in a sense it's quite unnatural for Black writers to try to mimic the Victorian or the Elizabethan stylist, when they had their own culture, their own experience, to write about.

Addison Gayle 00:03:31.240
Well, you see, the problem with that is really an academic one, and that is that if one talks about the literary establishment the rules and canons have been, for a very long time, prescribed by the academic community. After all books are really bought, read, in the universities. Now what the academic establishment has often said, in terms of Black writing, is that there is no Black culture, no particular Black experience, that one can differentiate from that of the overall American experience. Therefore, the Black writer must then direct his explications, his explorations, to what is supposedly a common American experience. Now, what this negated was that the, quote, melting pot, end quote, had never melted, and that there are distinct Black experiences, even though they do, as Ellison has said, merge, at some point, with the overall larger American experience.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:33.270
I think you see this in terms of Jewish writing.

Addison Gayle 00:04:36.352
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:36.354
Jewish writers have basically many of the themes that the-- great Jewish writers, people like Bellow have-- Saul Bellow-- have written about, are themes that, yes, cut across--

Addison Gayle 00:04:48.455
Certainly

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:48.457
--everyone's culture, but they have a particular identity that roots itself in the Jewish culture, and has been a contributory to the stream of American culture, but at the same time, is different. And probably, if we look back to the Harlem Renaissance-- in the Renaissance many of our writers are really trying to mimic some of the writing that was considered to be good stylized writing. Yet we had people like Claude McKay who were trying to break out of that and describe the Black experience. And of course, we have the legendary Langston Hughes who in his own way, his only syncretic way, developed a style, which was-- it's Langston Hughes' style but also, it's really a reflection of what happens in those Black beauty shops and those--

Addison Gayle 00:05:35.762
Certainly, certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:05:35.765
--Black barber shops, and on the corner, which is just as important as what happened on Hester Street in the Jewish ghetto, or what might happen on Mulberry Street in the Italian ghetto, or what happened on Beacon Hill in Boston, as it were.

Addison Gayle 00:05:50.521
Certainly, certainly. You see, I've always argued that one cannot divorce Black literature from the sociology, politics, and history of this country. And if you look at what has been going on, traditionally, in Black literature, it has been a reflection of the larger society suggesting that there is nothing valuable in the Black experience. Now, too many Black writers accept that that is dictum, and therefore attempted to write material that did not reflect the Black experience. You're quite right about Langston, and McKay, and Rudolph Fisher, because it is in the Harlem Renaissance that you got this tremendous schism between what I call the old guard, and the new writers. And that is Braithwaite and Jesse Fauset, on one hand, arguing, of course, that the Black writer must continue to impress the American society with the fact that he is almost an assimilatable item, and people like Hughes on the other hand, arguing that, look, we have a distinct culture, that we have a tradition, and we must pay attention to that. That that is the job of the writer. This comes together in the Harlem Renaissance in a very tremendous way.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:04.710
And, of course, the Harlem Renaissance, many people are unaware, was really subsidized largely by the white community--

Addison Gayle 00:07:09.421
Of course it was, certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:10.171
--the so-called patrons of the arts, the van Vechtens and the wealthy people who came to Harlem to, more or less, be voyeurs--

Addison Gayle 00:07:18.731
Sure. Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:18.733
--looking in on this esoteric culture.

Addison Gayle 00:07:21.891
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:22.351
And when the crash came in '29 and '30, the white money that was supporting the Renaissance went down the drain, and therefore the energy of Black writing had to really depend on the quality of Black writing and the extent of which Blacks, and those whites who were really interested in the Black experience, would buy and relate to Black writing. And of course that's where magazines like "The Crisis" and "Opportunity," which became a major publication vehicle for Black writing, performed a major role. But it also may relate to the next question I want to ask you and that is the role of the novel. It appears that our weakest development in Black writing has been the novel. We've had lots of-- in terms of quantity, not necessarily quality, because, Richard Wrights, they have-- some, of course, a great novel, and several others. But we had a tremendous amount of qual-- quantity in poetry, in essays, and short stories. And now even more recently in plays, even short plays. But the novel, which may well be the most difficult thing to construct in the literary world, is something that there really has not been a great breakthrough on. What's your opinion about that? I know--

Addison Gayle 00:08:42.51.00000000005821
Well--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:08:42.053
--you've written about that and I know you've thought about it. What's your opinion on that?

Addison Gayle 00:08:44.910
I would think that the novel had to go through a different kind of history, in terms of a cultural breakthrough. Once Wright had written "Native Son," the protest novel had begun and ended, okay. And I mean "begun" in the sense that protest novels before Richard Wright were simply more or less monogrammed. So, all right, "Native Son" was the protest novel, but after you had written "Native Son," and after the reverberations that Wright expected from "Native Son" did not occur. The question then became, "Where is the novel going to go?" Now, Baldwin pointed it out. Baldwin said in his critique of "Native Son," that there is a Black tradition, and that is where the novelist must go. The difficulty there, was that, you know, to write a novel, it requires a great deal of expertise, I'm not only talking about tactical. The novelist has to know a great deal.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:47.870
You have to have experience--

Addison Gayle 00:09:49.351
He has to have experience that--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:50.771
Travel--

Addison Gayle 00:09:50.773
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:51.960
He has to know people--

Addison Gayle 00:09:51.966
He has to know literature.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:52.880
Right.

Addison Gayle 00:09:53.220
All right, you know one of the things that bothers me, if I might interject this, about many Black students, and I suppose other students-- particularly Black students, is that somehow we believe that one can write a novel without a literary background. And you know the literary background includes writers, per se. Wright read everything. Baldwin read-- Ellis-- everything, Ellison read everything. The difficulty is that our young novelists did not know enough, and therefore, we had a very-- a paucity of novelists. All right, now, I think another reason, it's very difficult still for a Black novelist to be published in this country. Very difficult. I've just received the first novel by a young lady, which is tremendous. It's called "Ludell," by Brenda Wilkerson. I'm very surprised it was published. Now, I know why it was published: because the house lost its major Black writer, quote unquote. But it's been very difficult for Black novelists to be published. Now, I suppose another reason, of course, would be that there's a great deal of confusion at this point among novelists as to what the Black novel should be. All right, and they are arguing--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:13.781
That's a key-- [crosstalk] That's a key question, because that's been part of the dialogue between, or about Baldwin, and Ellison, Baraka, and John Williams, John Killens: What really should the Black novel be? And of course, this is why the essay and the short story and the poetry, which just take slices of the--

Addison Gayle 00:11:37.261
Certainly--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:37.264
--Black experience, and projects it--

Addison Gayle 00:11:39.451
Certainly--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:39.453
--and bombards you with it, and it makes you laugh and cry and hate, and so on, had been successful. But the novel, which is really a painting, a panoply of the whole Black experience, is really hard to deal with.

Addison Gayle 00:11:54.152
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:54.531
And when you run down your outstanding Black novels you really don't get very far-- a long list. You find some interesting ones, but you don't get very far down that list as you run down those.

Addison Gayle 00:12:05.741
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:06.241
And that really is one of the points. And of course, you made a key point just a few moments ago, where you said that a publishing house lost "its Black writer." Now of course, whenever we get to a position where, the quota system--

Addison Gayle 00:12:19.681
Sure--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:19.921
--we finally have broken it in sports so that you have more than one Black player--

Addison Gayle 00:12:23.072
Sure--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:23.641
--we've broken it in some aspects of entertainment, but we apparently we haven't broken it in the publishing [crosstalk]. They get one good Black writer and that's their Black writer.

Addison Gayle 00:12:32.211
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:32.910
And that's it.

Addison Gayle 00:12:33.841
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:34.201
And that has to do with the controls that the publishing industry itself and those critics exercise over what is published.

Addison Gayle 00:12:42.180
Well, of course. One of the antidotes to it, of course, is the establishment of Black publishing companies, which is going on on a small scale. Well I think another antidote has to be that a Black audience has to evolve, which then has to demand that publishing companies somehow move outside of the old prescribed tradition. It still goes on and I can go through the publishing houses and name "the Black writer."

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:12.510
I believe you've recently published a couple of books. You want to tell our audience about that?

Addison Gayle 00:13:16.470
Well, I've finished "The Way of the New World," which is a history of the Black novel in America. And "The Black Aesthetic ," of course, which provided a great deal of the [laughs] confusion--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:29.281
And argumentation--

Addison Gayle 00:13:29.462
--talked about earlier and, of course, "The Black Situation," which I published earlier, among others.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:13:37.530
And of course, as a published writer, and as a critic, you recognize these very problems that we're talking about. And one of the roles, I think, that people like you can play, is to continue to highlight some of these concerns that affect those of us who read and appreciate Black writing.

Addison Gayle 00:13:57.331
Well, hopefully. I try.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:00.901
That's true. People like yourself have a major responsibility. And in this trying, in this attempting to interpret, etc., what is your role? How do you perceive your role as a professor? I know that in the revolution, the emergence of Black Pride, there has been a tendency to say, "Well look, we should only read things that Black people write, we should only talk about Black. It shouldn't [inaudible] with the so-called classical themes etc. What's your opinion about that? Because you are an opinion maker, you're a professor, you're a leader and you're a key person in the Black literary community.

Addison Gayle 00:14:35.730
Well, I first usually tell students that writing, like everything else, involves hard work. There's no excuse for it, if you're not going to work hard, writing isn't the place for you. Second, a writer has to know everything. My argument with traditional American literature courses and English courses is that Blacks have been almost totally excluded.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:02.630
That's right.

Addison Gayle 00:15:03.001
No one [crosstalk]--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:03.541
That's major-- it's a major omission.

Addison Gayle 00:15:05.391
Sure. Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:06.691
Because of literary-- if you're talking American literature--

Addison Gayle 00:15:08.731
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:08.733
--and you have a person read "Native Son"--

Addison Gayle 00:15:11.271
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:12.390
--and that's all that relates to the--

Addison Gayle 00:15:13.041
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:13.043
--Black community--

Addison Gayle 00:15:13.951
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:13.953
--you can't possibly have studied American literature.

Addison Gayle 00:15:16.470
Certainly. Now I have the-- the other side of that, of course, is that one cannot then argue that-- some people argue that Black people should only read Black writers. My argument is that, if you're a student, if you're going to be a writer, you read every aspect of culture. Not only American writers. You read Jewish writers, you read Russian writers, you read African writers, you read Black writers. All right. In addition to that, I think one has to know something about this world beyond a kind of narrow parochialism that you're subject to get in most American literature courses. And so my suggestion, always, to students, is you read, you think, and you keep your eyes open. You observe and you learn as much about this world as you possibly can, remembering that that is what writers did.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:17.310
One thing that you didn't mention, which I know you do, and I know you encourage your students to do, and that is to discuss.

Addison Gayle 00:16:22.591
Oh, certainly. Oh yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:23.191
That the key point-- those of us who--

Addison Gayle 00:16:25.051
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:25.053
--grew up on college campuses, whether it's in the South, in the village, or what have you, remember those times when we sat in the dormitory room or you sat in a bar in Greenwich Village or in Cambridge, or wherever you happen to have gone to school, and argued. I call it arguing--

Addison Gayle 00:16:39.631
Sure, sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:41.591
--Some people call it discussing--

Addison Gayle 00:16:42.631
Still do.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:43.232
--Just getting your points out--

00:16:45.060
Sure. --and then having them tested--

Addison Gayle 00:16:46.601
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:16:47.011
--with the development of the confidence that goes along with that. And I think the intellectual alacrity that develops as a result of that type of thing.

Addison Gayle 00:16:56.850
Well, certainly. You know, look, I I have been-- I am often attacked for it-- for critical statements that I make, right. And people say to me, now and then, "Look, why don't you answer so-and-so?" A very solemn answer: because I believe that ideas are to be placed in the marketplace, and they are to be debated upon, discussed, analyzed and taken apart, because you learn that way. And I think this is even truer for students. It's true for all of-- certainly students. Now a great deal of this should go on in literature courses in the college. I'm distressed because in the college in which I teach, and a great many of the literature courses, the ideas usually have nothing to do with Black people. It is-- it is inconceivable to me that one could live in 20th-century America and discuss literature, and discuss ideas without-- without discussing some of the ideas that Blacks have contributed.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:59.241
Some of the ideas that Blacks have contributed and some of the central themes in our society that--

Addison Gayle 00:18:03.391
Of course.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:03.393
--are related to Blacks--

Addison Gayle 00:18:04.411
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:04.741
For example the-- the virulence and penetration of racism, not just anti-Black racism but anti-yellow racism--

Addison Gayle 00:18:12.501
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:13.271
--Anti-red racism--

Addison Gayle 00:18:14.671
Sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:15.331
--And in terms of religion, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, which have been major themes in development of, you know, the American ethos [crosstalk], to to not discuss those--

00:18:27.961
Certainly. --to not take-- for example, let's take Faulkner. Faulkner, in my opinion's a wonderful writer, had some very interesting things to say about black people. I didn't necessarily agree with all--

Addison Gayle 00:18:39.671
Certainly, certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:39.951
-- but-- in fact, I probably disagreed with a goodly number of them. But he had some interesting things to say about Black people.

Addison Gayle 00:18:45.451
Certainly, certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:46.051
And it's something that Black people and white people need to read.

00:18:49.561
Certainly. They need to discuss and put into some type of context. Now of course, the way I view this is that one of the great needs and motivations behind the Black studies movement was to get more of this into the curriculum.

Addison Gayle 00:19:03.171
Certainly, certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:03.691
And what we really need is Black studies, for Black people. I-- I'm not talking about segregated classes, but white people need Black studies as well--

Addison Gayle 00:19:12.070
Certainly--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:12.421
-as Black people.

Addison Gayle 00:19:13.081
Certainly, certainly. For one thing Black studies, if it's adequately taught, would help to explain a great many of the movements now occurring in the '70s. Read Jimmy Baldwin's "Another Country," and you've got three movements going on there, the gay liberation movement, the women's movement, and certainly the continuing Black movement. So that-- if one is going to understand, you know-- it's nothing new, right? Said a long time ago that Black people are the American metaphor. If you want to discuss so many ideas relating to situations going on in this country, you begin with Black-- with Black history and with Black literature.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:49.021
And, of course, probably the key reason for that is the fact that, physically, Blacks-- by physically, I mean in terms of their color-- are easily identified--

Addison Gayle 00:19:58.261
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:58.561
--in the context of society, and they get, in a sense, the first brush of any kind of change in terms of social climate etc. And then because of our African heritage there's a certain way of relating to the world which is somewhat different than the more controlled European or Western--

Addison Gayle 00:20:18.751
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:19.381
--way of viewing the world.

Addison Gayle 00:20:20.191
Sure, sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:20.193
And those things come into interaction in our music, and in our art and dance, and in our writing. It's my opinion, Addison, that our theater, Black theater is much more advanced than Black writing, particularly our Black novels, our--

Addison Gayle 00:20:41.611
Well--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:41.613
--large-scale development. Now, maybe--

Addison Gayle 00:20:43.981
Well--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:43.983
--you want to--

Addison Gayle 00:20:45.001
Yeah--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:45.003
disagree with [crosstalk]. Let's examine that.

Addison Gayle 00:20:46.741
I really don't actually-- my-- my argument, I think, with the novelists is that in certain areas, they have not taken what I consider new directions. I really don't want to appear here to be actually denigrating their accomplishments.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:04.001
No ,not at all.

Addison Gayle 00:21:04.771
We do have-- we have--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:06.151
We've made some major--

Addison Gayle 00:21:07.361
--a fair--Yeah. We have a fairly good group of novelists who are working today. And though I don't agree with many of them, they're doing a pretty good job. I have difficulty with the drama, and I think I have difficulty with the drama because there has not been the kind of major debate going on among the dramatists, as there has been with the novelists, and with the poets, so that dramatists-- I-- the problem with that is that Baraka has stopped writing drama. And I think Baraka could have provided-- because of the kinds of plays that he wanted to write, that he had begun to write-- could have provided that fulcrum across which people would disagree or agree, and you might have gotten a more viable drama.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:59.221
I think that's an interesting point of course you really are dealing with what you might call a "great man theory" which I guess applies to--

Addison Gayle 00:22:05.942
Not really--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:06.751
--literature.

Addison Gayle 00:22:07.271
Yeah, not really, I think what I'm saying is that if you're going to arrive at a point where there's a distinct direction, then alternatives have to be discussed--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:17.711
OK.

Addison Gayle 00:22:17.713
--and debated. And I think Baraka presented one alternative. I think Doug Ward presents another alternative. I think Ed Bullins presents another alternative, but you don't have that debate going on, that you have going on--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:32.371
Of course, that's very interesting. I think your observation is correct there. And that might be because of the economic success of--

Addison Gayle 00:22:39.233
I would think so.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:39.238
--the theater. The black theater is literally-- has made it. It's made it in the sense that Black audiences will support Black theater. We found that with "River Niger." We found that with some of Ed Bullins' work. We found that with-- most recently-- "The First Breeze of Summer" that Doug Ward did. So you find that also white people will support it, for some reason or another, either because of the fact that the message is either more dramatic and they can associate with it, and don't have to plow through word by word, or because it might be just drawing a different clientele.

Addison Gayle 00:23:20.101
Well I think--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:20.641
We get the support for black theater.

Addison Gayle 00:23:22.740
I think there's a more basic reason. That is that Black theater has been, for the past four or five years, and the plays that you mentioned were the very few exceptions, have not made people uncomfortable. If you read Jimmy Baldwin, you're going to be uncomfortable, all right. If you watch "The First Breeze of Summer," there's nothing in that to disturb anybody, except a few Black people were disturbed by it. If you read John Williams you're going to be uncomfortable. And I think the American society it is not any longer-- this goes for a great many Blacks, as well as whites-- want to be made uncomfortable by Black novelists, Black dramatists. Black dramatists, for some reason or another, have ceased making people very uncomfortable with the exception perhaps of-

Ed Bullins.

Addison Gayle 00:24:09.130
Ed Bullins and, I think Ron Milner. I'll t- [crosstalk]

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:12.230
Well of course, [crosstalk] that really relates to the way in which the arts developed. Arts tend to have a cycle frame the critics have a lot to do with your success. Your producers, your backers. Whereas the publishing industry controls writing and what's published, the availability of money and the extent to which you can get backers supports theater, and drama, and in a sense, dance. And with the advent of so many public companies and neighborhood theaters there really are more outlets--

Addison Gayle 00:24:48.251
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:48.253
--for drama. But I think your point is really well taken that the dialogue the critical dialogue that exist around Black writing really is not-- has not developed to a very high level around Black theater. And I think that's something that people in the arts, Black people in the arts, really should deal with. Now to come back to the question of how do we get more young Black-- how do we get more Black people involved in writing and criticizing writing, other than a traditional route and a very important route which you describe, of going to school and learning as much as you can. Still, there is a question of, well, what do you do when you write? How do you get criticized? How do you get it published? What do you do? What's your advice to young people on that score?

Addison Gayle 00:25:34.901
Well, first I think that any young person interested in writing should seek out a workshop. There are a number of workshops in New York City and they've had various successes. Quite a few writers have emerged out of these workshops.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:51.550
Now, how does someone get in touch? I know we've had John Killens, for example, he talked about his workshop--

00:25:56.620
Yup--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:56.622
and we've had-- Joan Sanders talked about some of the things we're doing in drama. Basically, the way in which one finds out about these, is to establish some type of contact.

Addison Gayle 00:26:07.351
There is a--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:07.354
Various people in the arts.

Addison Gayle 00:26:08.621
Yeah there is a Frederick Douglass Creative Center, at 129th Street in Harlem, which offers workshops in all of the writing areas, from journalism, on up through fiction. But I know a few of them myself, but-- that's a good question as to how one would get into contact.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:30.490
You know, what I've found, and this even happens to me sometimes, that the best way is to just pick up the phone, or pick up a pen, write to a writer.

Addison Gayle 00:26:40.331
Certainly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:40.811
There are very few writers who won't respond--

Addison Gayle 00:26:44.421
Yes, sure.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:26:44.424
--to a [crosstalk], "I'd like you to come up and speak," or "I'd like to have you look at this piece of work." Because there is something contagious about people in the arts who write. They do want their work to be criticized, and they are generally very willing to criticize other people's work.

Addison Gayle 00:27:01.121
Yeah, I might add a great many people do this, too. I'm sure you get manuscripts all the time. I get manuscripts from people, and that's a good point because people-- writers-- if they don't have the information, or the time, they certainly will-- will tell you, or suggest places where you can go. I think the workshop idea's a very good idea, it was very productive in the latter part of the '60s and I think it's coming back, primarily because young people, more and more, are beginning to want to articulate their experiences, and writing is a good way of doing it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:34.840
Now of course you did mention earlier, the idea of a Black publishing house.

Addison Gayle 00:27:38.261
Yes, yes.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:38.591
And not just a Black publishing house, a Black publishing industry, in a sense. And I think that's something that, really, we need to spend more time thinking about.

Addison Gayle 00:27:47.501
Certainly. There are several. There are some pretty good ones, in operation now, and hopefully they'll get better.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:27:55.630
I know Dudley Randall has Broadside, out of Detroit, and [crosstalk]

Addison Gayle 00:27:59.951
Donnelly has Third World Press--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:02.171
He does.

Addison Gayle 00:28:02.174
--out in Chicago.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:28:03.670
Our guest on tonight's "Soul of Reason" has been Professor Addison Gayle, who's Associate Professor of Literature at Baruch College of the City University of New York. And we've been talking about the exciting world of Black writing. What makes it tick? What do we need to do to develop more Black writers?
