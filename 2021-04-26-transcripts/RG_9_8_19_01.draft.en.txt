Speaker 1 00:00:01.500
In 1964 the surgeon general of the United States Public Health Service declared smoking a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant remedial action. Since then Americans smoking habits have decreased and are now increasing. Here Robert Wallace of the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health discussed what can be done to cut into America's major health hazard. On tonight's soul of reason. This is Soul of reason a program that will examine the roots of the black box.

Speaker 2 00:00:52.620
Soul of reason is produced by the W NBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Junior director of the Institute of Afro-American affairs at New York University.

Speaker 3 00:01:13.770
With us this evening on soul of reason is Robert Wallace who is executive director of the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health. Glad to have you with us tonight Bob. Glad to be here. Well of course we don't have any cigarettes in the studio but a lot of people do. Not only in the studios but in homes and classrooms and the like. And of course the smoking problem is deemed to be one of the major problems in terms of America's health particularly in terms of heart disease and lung disease and all other kinds of diseases. So could you. For our audience this information sort of enlarge on this. What really is the magnitude of the smoking problem in the United States.

Speaker 4 00:01:53.020
Well I think to begin with you you characterize it very accurately when you said that it is America's it's probably America's largest contradiction in because we know that the cigarette smoking is going to result in certain kinds of effects upon individuals and yet the government and the society in general kind of accept cigarette smoking as a part of its social fabric. I have the data I have is is verified for 1970 and of course the figures today are probably somewhat higher for example than there were in 1970 there were 59 million men over 17 years of age in this country 43 percent of those people smoked and 21 of them 26 percent of them smoked more than a pack a day at the same period there were 65 million women in the United States in the same age group. Thirty one percent of those smoked and 18 percent of those who smoked smoked at least a pack a day.

Speaker 5 00:02:55.140
But I understand Bob that since 1970 which was about the nadir the lowest point after the surgeon general's push against smoking it has risen so it almost put I think I read the other day some 45 percent of Americans are smoking now. And despite all of the DEA's neckties cigarettes and all that business apparently the health specialists in this country still think that smoking is the major hazard that man has some control.

Speaker 6 00:03:24.360
Oh yes. It's probably the major health problem that that you could do something about by just stopping now.

Speaker 7 00:03:30.900
Are there racial differences. That's one of the things that black people we want to know. We've been trying to find that out. That's an that's a very very good question.

Speaker 6 00:03:38.160
We have. I've talked to some people at the at the clearinghouse in Atlanta Georgia to determine whether or not they're on any significant differences among blacks and other groups. I have heard unofficially and of course we have not been able to to verify that. But I've heard that the rates are increasing significantly more for black women than for any other group. As you know the increase of the major increase in the cigarette smoking habit has been among women. They have a whole liberalisation of the women's movement has freed them to smoke a good deal more. There are some who feel that among that among the women smoke is that black women are smoking an increasingly larger percentages than other groups. And if that's true it will be very unfortunate because as you know all of this is going to come back to haunt us in another decade or two.

Speaker 3 00:04:29.820
Well what about the allegations that these did make the ties low tar cigarettes tend to minimize their hazards and I believe the major has It's lung cancer which is now about the third or fourth leading cause of death in America coronary disease and other kinds of lung disease such as emphysema and other breathing disease.

Speaker 6 00:04:52.230
Well we haven't had enough experience with the the low tar and nicotine cigarettes to say that they're going to result in certain benefits. But what we do know if you if you can show the relationship between tar nicotine and certain kinds of illnesses and whatnot that we know that by reducing the feeling is that by reducing the intake of tar and nicotine you lessen the problem and then cigarettes on the market today are significantly lower. And those two contaminants both tar and nicotine the Interagency Council and most other groups interested in the smoking problem really talk about abstinence all.

Speaker 3 00:05:34.860
That's a good starting point. I know at one time they were saying and if you didn't smoke anymore and five cigarettes a day you're probably in pretty good shape. And if you didn't inhale you would be in even better shape but let's talk about the Interagency Council on Smoking and Health. You're a black man you're a health educator you come from a background in Tuberculosis and Lung research and community health and you're heading an agency which has a very attractive title but also somewhat confusing Interagency Council on Smoking and how first of all is this a government organization.

Speaker 4 00:06:06.360
No it's not. Although we do do some work by contract for the government the National Interagency Council is a voluntary association of some 33 voluntary and official agencies that have gotten together to express their concerns and to do something about smoking as a as a health hazard.

Speaker 6 00:06:26.700
The council is made up of most of the large voluntary health agencies. What are some of the agents of the American Cancer Society the American Lung Association the American Heart Association the American Public Health Association the American Medical Association the National Congress of Parents and teachers used to be active with the group the National jogging Association for example and a number on some five governmental agencies including the Office of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Office of Education.

Speaker 8 00:07:03.220
And where do you get your money from. Well we get our money back and you know what happens. Oh my goodness that we couldn't possibly do that but we get our money from from the agencies that our member agencies of the of the council and and they.

Speaker 4 00:07:17.060
Each of those agencies that that our members send a representative to the board of directors of the Council and support comes from all of them. We welcome contributions from any outside group that's interested in our work of course but the bulk of our support about about 90 percent of it no more.

Speaker 3 00:07:33.830
Okay now your major thrust because you're a health educator and community educator. Apparently a major thrust is in the educational realm. It's not in the legislative realm or is it. What is your major thrust.

Speaker 7 00:07:46.200
That's a good question because you see all of the agencies that or at least most of them that are involved in the council are agencies that conduct programs of their own in the smoking area. The council is by intent is not to duplicate those efforts. In other words if the if the American Lung or the American Cancer Society are conducting programs the council is not to try to get into the program area so that we see ourselves serving in large measure as a coordinating group to avoid the kind of unnecessary duplication that would. You know one organization need not spend money on one activity when I give an example of a couple of specific things that you're into. Oh well we've we've been very active in the legislative area. We have the council has developed a series of position papers on the on the differential tax return nicotine. And we were we fought very hard to try to get that piece of legislation passed and we're trying to get it at the federal level. The council now is waiting a contract with AGW to do something in the youth area. We feel that the major thrust of the council should be to work on preventing and youth from smoking and getting them to give the habit up and things of that kind of nature so that we are there to do the kinds of jobs at the individual agencies cannot do themselves and we think that as a national council we can do them better.

Speaker 9 00:09:09.300
Now I would imagine a lot of it has to mobilize in the prestige of important people in the country. And one of the things that's very interesting is a number of important people in our country smoke many of the opinion formers smoke. Many of advertisements in recent magazines who was smoking I believe based on some of the efforts of some of the anti-smoking people cigarettes are no longer advertised on television. They try any magnitude.

Speaker 7 00:09:37.710
No they're not advertised on television at all.

Speaker 10 00:09:40.110
That's in my state do advertise these fancy cigars. There's slim cigars.

Speaker 7 00:09:46.620
Yeah. There has been an attempt to get that banned as well. I'm not sure what the status of that is right now. But but as the cigarette advertising has dropped on television there's been an increasing expenditure by the cigarette companies on and on the printed material. For example know if you read a magazine today you see that a substantial portion of their advertising comes from the cigarette companies as do billboards and subway cars. I've now become very very conscious of this and as I ride the buses and the subways in the city I try to sit there and count the number of cigarette advertisements that appear where before you may have found one or two on a subway car you now find a great many of them so that they have increased their expenditures significantly as the revenues from television advertising has dropped. There's been an increase in other men.

Speaker 3 00:10:35.790
Now has there been any real attempt to involve grassroots community groups in this. I know the black community has a number of very substantial grassroots groups a lot of black churches social agencies and the like. And we've been working in the black community in a variety of things housing and health and crime and education health in terms of health services is something. Community groups definitely been involved in but health in terms of education is is a hard thing to sell.

Speaker 9 00:11:10.250
Another major problem we have which affects a black group as well is alcoholism. If you take smoking and alcohol and poor diet and air pollution and put them together you have practically all of the environmental hazards that cut our live shot or make our lives more miserable. So what is being done in the black community. What kind of responses have you gotten from the black community.

Speaker 7 00:11:35.090
Well I could not really say that I'm on top of what's happening in the black community and in this area in this area in this specific area and you've put your hand on a very very very very sensitive issue.

Speaker 4 00:11:47.630
I have heard and I remember when I was doing health education in the 50s in the 60s and there was an attempt to get into this kind of thing. I remember people saying well the black community has got enough to worry about without you getting on their back about cigarette smoking. So let them keep this kind of habit and divert enjoy it so that yeah.

Speaker 8 00:12:11.210
So if they you know if you don't have a decent house and you don't have a decent job and you you're not eating as well as you should maybe you ought to have the privilege of smoking. Well of course that sounds good on the face of it it doesn't sound good to me anymore but it's a contradiction in terms because you realize that the people who can least afford it are the people who are going to suffer the most from this kind of this kind of habit. Now I know that there have been attempts by the agencies the council agencies specifically to do things in various communities for example the American Cancer Society does run a number of cigarettes stopping activities attempts to give people get people to give it up and these are free of charge on the other hand there are a number of of of proprietary organizations got people who are doing it for a profit who do that now the black community as any other poor community can least afford to pay for for a service which will help them.

Speaker 9 00:13:05.620
Well I was thinking about things like working with our black athletes to encourage them not to endorse cigarettes and other types of tobacco products.

Speaker 8 00:13:14.780
See that again is the contradiction we face because the black athlete will tell you that he doesn't get those kinds of opportunities for endorsements that white athletes get and that certainly true it is true. Therefore if he gets one and cigarette smoking is after one to go along with. That's right. I remember years ago when I was out in Queens we got that we had our Jackson. We played with the Mets played with the Mets who talked about cigarette smoking but we got into some of the discussion and he pointed out some of the difficulties of the black athlete in this.

Speaker 3 00:13:42.860
All right. Very briefly summarize in a couple of words how effective you think this campaign is against smoking has been.

Speaker 8 00:13:49.940
Well I think it's it's it's making some significant achievements.

Speaker 6 00:13:54.500
You have to remember that for all of the people who who don't smoke there are more there for all the people who do smoke. There are more who don't smoke. And that's a significant achievement.

Speaker 3 00:14:03.110
And it is through the work of groups like the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health that we will make some significant progress on that. All right. We're talking with Robert Wallace who is executive director of the Interagency Council on Smoking and Health. And Bob as we think about this whole question of deterring people from going into behaviors which are dangerous to their health. What are some of the psychological factors. For example why do so many young people now who never really smoked and I've seen all these ads and all these warnings on the cigarette boxes and the ads etc. pick up smoking and sort of do it as a fashionable type of thing. Why is it that that tends to outweigh the disadvantages to health.

Speaker 11 00:14:50.720
Well I think you put your hand on it. It is the fashionable thing to do for many young people to smoke. There's no question that that in many settings the the teenage leaders are smokers and the and the people that that kind of gravitate around them or pick that up as a habit. We've been working with some young people recently. We found that some of them said they smoked out of just sheer boredom that they were not being sufficiently challenged in school or in the community so that they started smoking as a kind of way to kind of pass the time of day.

Speaker 10 00:15:23.460
One thing particularly in the black community you might say that if someone's going to smoke it's better that they smoke. Well I don't know what better they smoke nicotine than marijuana because some of the research indicates that marijuana may not be quite as dangerous that way but in a sense it might be a better habit than hitting on hard drugs but that's like taking the lesser of two evils.

Speaker 3 00:15:45.050
And since both of them are very have very serious consequences I don't think we should approach it that way. But as you as a health educator begin to look at techniques to try to keep people or dissuade people from smoking. What are some of the techniques that you think are most effective.

Speaker 11 00:16:02.640
Well of course the most fundamental thing is for the information to be there for people to to get.

Speaker 10 00:16:06.870
I mean that that's what we know in health education. Information doesn't really change behavior.

Speaker 8 00:16:12.900
That's true. But if you don't have the information you can't change your behavior anyway. So the first thing you have to of course is to have the information there.

Speaker 11 00:16:18.180
Secondly you've got to get people to understand to try to understand why did it why they smoke. Obviously increasingly young people smoke because they think it's the thing to do for you know it's mature and it's grown up and it's a it's a it's expressing themselves in some kind of free way. I think the changing times have permitted this to a great extent.

Speaker 10 00:16:37.440
Well don't you think that the movies and television that where someone's really in a tight spot they reach in at a park and pull out a cigarette and they take a deep drag and it makes them relax it makes them look sophisticated and it slows things down.

Speaker 7 00:16:49.470
I think some of the research suggests that that's why they smoke because it gives them a sense that they can they if you if you remember if you were ever a smoker you remember that I wasn't.

Speaker 11 00:16:59.070
Well you may have been I mean I was many years ago but the times you smoke or those times when you're trying to get a little bit of time to get yourself together you walk into a room with strangers or you come into a restaurant where you're where you're a new personality entering and you take out a cigarette because it helps slow things down. I think one of the reasons a lot of young people smoke is because their parents smoke and they pick the habit up from there.

Speaker 10 00:17:22.829.9999999998836
Well let's assume that those are some of the reasons. Now what are some of the techniques that can be used to help people move away from that. For example the idea of getting yourself together and slowing down is a very good one. You know sometimes people say it's better than cutting somebody out or it's better than shivering or shaking or mumbling or what have you. How do you deal with that.

Speaker 5 00:17:45.290
Because I do know that they are actually professional anti-smoking clinics and programs which attempt to deal with these very issues that we're talking about that's great.

Speaker 12 00:17:55.020
You've got to find another mechanism for slowing things down for yourself for example of some of the more simple things that are being done to help people give it up of course is to make it it is to make it inconvenient to smoke if you don't have pockets in your shirts or your jacket you cannot carry cigarettes normally if you're tied a certain way so that to put it they suggest you put it in a back pocket with a button on it and they suggest that you keep a tabulation of the number of cigarettes because if you are a smoker half your cigarettes you smoke without realizing you're smoking. I mean you just do it out of sheer habit so you can make it very difficult for you for yourself to smoke and that's don't carry matches for example or don't carry cigarettes. Secondly the environment can help you by. I find an increasing number of people smoking on buses smoking or not smoking smoking but isn't smoking on buses illegal of course it is. But nobody forced Nobody pushes the issue that the young people go in the back and sit setting them back and they smoke. Well now if that kind of restriction were enforced and I really can't say I don't I can blame the bus driver for not making an issue of it. He's got other things to worry about. But if you can prevent people from smoking they do not smoke on the subways for example. Very very first panel is it because there are hundreds of very severe. These are some of the kinds of things that you can do all you can get the peer to adopt a non smoking attitude.

Speaker 5 00:19:14.850
Some of the things we've done in a project that the council sponsors called National Education Week on Smoking and Health is to get kids to look at the problem in very very significant terms and what it's doing to their body and to get the group collectively to take certain steps to give up to prevent the habit from and of course what we we're doing tonight on sole reason is another one of those techniques that in our society where communication is so important discussing important social and health issues on the media or on television among groups is another way of developing sort of an acceptance. For example it is very socially acceptable now if you in a meeting and someone beside you attempts to light up you said Yeah I'd appreciate if you're not smoke.

Speaker 8 00:19:57.300
That's right.

Speaker 10 00:19:57.690
That's been there's been a significant change that is different than it was 10 years ago when someone would say 10 years ago. What are you some kind of nut.

Speaker 5 00:20:04.890
But now the nut is the person who smokes because the evidence is so clear as a matter of fact I heard one of the news broadcasts the other day that if people who have started to smoke at 18 or 19 continue a pack a day habit certainly a 90 some odd percent of them will end up with some kind of lung cancer or heart problems related almost to nobody. It's almost inevitable. So with that it's just like taking a speeding automobile and heading it toward a brick wall. Right. You know what's going to happen to you. And I think part of the whole approach is getting some information and also some social acceptance of the fact that for those who want to do it that's all right. If a want to commit suicide but they don't need to extend it to others so that they have legislation such as the banning of smoking in elevators and some universities such as New York University where smoking is banned in classrooms.

Speaker 10 00:20:57.800
But interesting I don't know that frequently is not enforced because if the instructor decides he was or she was to smoke they just light up the night goes out and a smoking provision.

Speaker 12 00:21:08.440
Well the airlines for example now have smoking in a non-smoking section and other public conveniences buses have the same thing. Yes there has been a change in the public's attitude about smoking in the old days. You know your movie hero I can think of Humphrey Bogart walking oh every time he came on camera he was smoking a cigarette. That was his motive. That's right. Now that is no longer the thing to do and and not only do nonsmokers because nonsmokers feel they have some some rights that are being violated when people pollute the air with cigarette smoke. But nonsmokers will speak up about it and most institutions now say that smoking is really not the thing to do anymore and therefore it has discourage a great many people from from.

Speaker 3 00:21:52.140
Well particularly good relationship to the black community when you attempt to do health education as you say there are so many other problems that impact on the black community. Sometimes health education efforts get lost on the other hand.

Speaker 5 00:22:06.430
There has been successful health education against lead poisoning. It has been successful health education against smoking and bad which is one of the main reasons why you have fires and ghetto areas children playing with matches. So I would assume Bob but you could through your agency by establishing a liaison with some of the significant social agencies and church groups and other groups in the black community began to accelerate the campaign against smoking to a new high in the black community I would hope so.

Speaker 7 00:22:37.880
I tell you I have no patience with the argument that the black community has enough to worry about.

Speaker 4 00:22:42.740
So let's not let's not hassle them about cigarette smoking. I think it's a this is just another burden that blacks don't need to carry and unfortunately they are carrying it in disparate Hi disproportionately high percent.

Speaker 3 00:22:54.510
Well let's talk about some of the broader economic and political factors that cause a society like ours to continue to underwrite certain types of habit patterns such as smoking and drinking that can be and frequently are deleterious to the health of those people.

Speaker 5 00:23:17.000
Why is it is it just a kind of basic hedonism and man that just says I'm going to do these things regardless of the cost or is there really some significant economic motive behind.

Speaker 4 00:23:27.950
There is a significant economic motive behind it. The total contribution from the suit from tobacco industry to the gross national product in 1969 was eleven point two billion dollars.

Speaker 5 00:23:42.950
What proportion of the gross national product is that. I'm not sure what I was mentioning nicer product was about 800 million then.

Speaker 11 00:23:49.210
So somewhere around 1 or 2 percent may be a battleship or two that you see in 1973 the tobacco companies netted several hundred and four point four million dollars from the sale of tobacco.

Speaker 5 00:24:04.450
And and the jobs that are associated that's all.

Speaker 8 00:24:06.890
That's the whole thing and the total federal and state tax revenues in the 1970s was fifty five point seventy five billion dollars.

Speaker 11 00:24:13.580
Now you can see that that's a significant amount of money. And if you if you're talking about in some way abolishing cigarette smoking you're talking about having a real impact on on the viability of many states and many communities and possibly the federal government. We do an awful large export business of tobacco products and this is a this is subsidized to a large extent by the federal government direct direct subsidies to farmers and then subsidies for export and things like that so that we're talking about an awful lot of money. On the other hand some 300 million thousand people die every year from from illnesses tied in very significant ways to to you know what does that statistic on that 300 million 300 million that's the world over.

Speaker 5 00:25:04.250
Yes from diseases associated with that includes respiratory diseases coronary diseases various cancers that are associated with heavy smoking because this raises an interesting question about man in general man does seek various modes of alleviating his tensions and his recreation etc. And many of these come in the form of food products or special stimulants that come from the environment actually tobacco is grown from nature just like heroin comes from the poppy seed plant opium plant which is grown in nature.

Speaker 3 00:25:42.350
Alcohol as a result of fermentation. Various grain products and sugar products. So that ban has this propensity for. In a sense. Learning how to destroy himself. What do we do about that. How do we really approach that. I know that's a classic dilemma for any society. It's a classic dilemma for a health educator. It's particularly classic dilemma for black health educator because it I said black people have so many other problems other than just the basic health problems that go along with that an affluent society.

Speaker 7 00:26:13.340
Well I think the great experiment showed that that the prohibition really doesn't work in many areas and I think you can't outlaw it outright.

Speaker 11 00:26:21.020
That's what I do try to get people to do both in and in tobacco and alcohol and some of the other drug areas is to get them to want to understand what the problem is and to try to control the habit and to keep it within reasonable proportion so that no one is. To my knowledge except for certain kinds of disabilities would say that people shouldn't have any alcohol at all. The problem is that so often it doesn't stay at a moderate level it becomes a problem and the same thing would apply to cigarettes. We do say that if you have to smoke by all means try to smoke one of the cigarettes or lower tar and nicotine because the ingestion of these kinds of pollutants are what caused the problem. Oh I think our position is that people should not smoke period but if you must smoke and there are people that for many many reasons psychological reasons primarily they feel they have to have a cigarette that they try to pick a low tar low nicotine.

Speaker 5 00:27:15.670
Okay well one last question. Why is it that the inner agency approach is a voluntary one rather than an official one. Would it not be better for this to become a major organized effort of the official federal government or is it felt that the voluntary approach as epitomized by this agency is a better approach.

Speaker 11 00:27:37.550
Well I think the voluntary approach is a good approach. It has worked in many areas in this country.

Speaker 5 00:27:42.350
I think secondly for some of the contradictions we've already talked about it's very difficult for the federal government in spite of whatever commitment it may have for the federal government to come out and to say well we're going to do all we can to destroy the tobacco crop so that we have all of these contradictions that we must deal with and trade off in terms of solving this kind of major public health problem because this is really one of the key things that particularly this bicentennial year as you look at the American system it sort of differentiates from almost any system in the world that we have voluntary we have official and your approach is through the volunteer trying our guest on tonight soul so the reason has been Robert Wallace who is executive director of the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health and we've been talking about the impact of the serious health problem on the black and the world community and various approaches that might be utilized to help alleviate the very serious problem of smoking in the American public.
