A few weeks ago, 38 Black and Hispanic athletes were inducted into the Black Sports Hall of Fame causing considerable comment from the press. Allan Barron, publisher of Black Sports Magazine will discuss the Black Sports Hall of Fame on tonight's "Soul of reason".

Radio Bumper Intro 00:00:40.761
This is "Soul of Reason", a program that will examine the roots of the black thought. "Soul of Reason" is produced by WNBC Community Affairs Department in cooperation with the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University and will be presented each week at this time. Here now is your host Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:01:07.541
With us today on "Soul of Reason" is Allan Barron of Black Sports Magazine and you've been in the press quite recently and quite often because of the Black Sports Hall of Fame that Black Sports Magazine has started, and I was just wondering what is your overall reaction to the comment that says a Black Sports Hall of Fame is resegregation.

Allan P. Barron 00:01:31.610
Well of course I am immediately indignant to any kind of allegation about reverse segregation and discrimination on our part because anyone with any kind of minimal intellect can understand that the strength of an individual lies in his cognizance or his consciousness of himself. And one of the major problems with Black America is the fact that it has been reduced to a group of individuals who know basically very little about themselves. So as a result, our attempt with a Black Sports Hall of Fame is to provide not only the Black community, but the entire American population, with a very substantial role that sports has played in the struggle for survival in Black America, and to build in Black America that level of consciousness which is very, very sorely needed to make us better American citizens and be very candid about it.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:02:23.170
Okay. Well that's a excellent explication of why you have developed a Black Sports Hall of Fame, but how do you deal with a criticism like this: They said if somebody started a White Sports Hall of Fame everybody, would be crying segregation and blacks in particular would be upset about it.

Allan P. Barron 00:02:39.260
I would like to say and make this declaration to every Hall of Fame in America they are White Sports Halls of Fame. Just recently they started inducting brothers into Hall of Fame around this country. So I mean it's, it's, a ridiculous allegation to say that if someone started, a hall, a White Hall of Fame. Cooperstown was white for years. Canton, Ohio was white for years. In fact, these places are ridiculously white because so many of the super, super athletes were black athletes. If I could just talk to you for a few minutes about the Racing Hall of Fame. It was so ridiculous what happened there. Isaac Murphy, he got in because he had to do something that nobody else had ever done, he won the Kentucky Derby three times. But in addition to that, they used to rate the horses over, the over, the jockeys to the extent that there are horses names in Racing's Hall of Fame. But the jockeys were all black at that time so they didn't even list them at all.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:03:35.680
Yea of course that may not necessarily have been because they were Black. It might have just been because of the way in which they didn't think the jockeys were important. I think everybody now knows the jockeys are probably at least as important, maybe more important, than the horse.

Allan P. Barron 00:03:47.870
I would refute that with you because it was particularly because the jockeys were Black. You see, the institution of horse racing was an English sport, that the English gentleman never would sit the back of a horse. What they did is they used their indentured servants or their slaves to be the horsemen for them and they'd sit around outside with their ladies and their meal baskets, their picnic baskets, and watch these jockeys race these animals, these beast of burden, up and down. They wouldn't touch these things. It was only when horse racing became a very profitable venture did white jockeys become prevalent in the United States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:04:20.329.9999999999709
Although it's very interesting now, speaking of jockeys, so many of the top jockeys are Spanish, Hispanic backgrounds.

Allan P. Barron 00:04:27.020
That's that's true and because of their slight build.

00:04:30.051
It's probably a function of build. But let's get back to this whole idea of the Black Sports Hall of Fame. You made a very good point when you say that basically most sports hall of fame are white and that's probably because other than just the prejudice 90 percent of the population in America, 89 percent of it is white. So that by definition most sports hall of fame generally would have a large number of whites in it. On the other hand, there have been a number of blacks who have been very proficient in a variety of sports, particularly some of the older blacks. People that you honor from yesteryear who did not get into the halls of fame largely because of none of their prejudice. But it was alleged they never really competed at the major league level and in a sense that's true in that the leagues were separate and they didn't have as many players to deal with, and possibly the overall level might not have been as high. On the other hand, they played, particularly baseball, under such tremendous horrendous conditions, playing five ballgames in one day between three or four sites. Similarly if you just looked at even something like the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the difference between pro football, let's say white pro football and 1930s, and pro football in the 1960s and 70s is so different, it's just so different between a Model T Ford and a 73 Cadillac. So you do have those considerations. So then I would like to ask you what criteria did you use in selecting the various people to go into the Black Sports Hall of Fame in the first go round. In that well, and it's important that you point out the first go round because one of the things that you must keep in consideration is when you start a new institution and this is what the Black Sports Hall of Fame is, you have to have live and kicking bodies so people can really see and feel the vibrations of what this whole thing truly means and represents. But the criteria, the ultimate criteria, that we have used and that we will continue to use is excellence in abilities to perform the art of that particular sport. We also have a side criteria which we like to keep in light of, in light of what we're trying to accomplish and that is also guys who have done major things for their race. And this of course can be done particularly in sport again. But we used excellence and ability to perform as that thing that led us to to induct a guy like Fritz Pollard, who was not only a fantastic 145 pound halfback at Brown University, but he was the first black American to coach a professional team here in the United States.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:11.211
And was one of the first pro stars black or white. It is the reason why they drew so many people when for example no football

Allan P. Barron 00:07:17.511
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:07:18.441
But what about this idea of using a political criterion for a sports hall of fame. Is that really a good idea? Or am I correct when I use the term political criteria?

Allan P. Barron 00:07:27.470
No you're not correct because I would like not to think that it's, it's a political criteria that we have used in any of the criteria. We would like to think that it's strictly the consciousness that we're trying to deal with of Black people. That allegation was made primarily pertaining to Jose Torres, who one particular sports writer claimed was never a great champion. Well I didn't say that he had to be a great champion. I said he had to be a great person in his sport prior to Jose being a champion, he was a great boxer. He was a great fighter. He was a guy who won the Olympic championship and came back and became, the light, light heavyweight champion of the world. And I think that during his course of his rise from his amateur days to his title holding, which was just one year, he was a dynamic boxer. I mean he was a great boxer. Now of course he was not a great champion, but that's not what we talked about. It was not a political move on our part. None of the athletes who have been inducted have been on a political nature. I think if that was the case maybe we would have done just the opposite. We would have reacted quite differently because you see, one of the major factors in the establishment of this hall of fame is white American corporate money. So if we were, if we were really trying to be political we would have leaned away from Muhammad Ali, and leaned away from Jose Torres who are pretty notorious guys for their political activism, and not so highly thought of in the corporate structure. You know as great, good solid Black Americans.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:09:01.610
All right well, what about some of the--I noticed you had a number what you might call minor sports and you put some of those people in. Is that just to give some recognition to these minor sports or are you really just saying anybody who is a top in whatever his particular field is?

Allan P. Barron 00:09:19.010
Well one of the things that's really important is the fact that so many things get lost as history unrolls. And we didn't put in one thing in the press which will which will be inducted and that's bowling because so many people don't realize the impact that bowling has had on this country, and the impact that bowling has had on Black America. That Black people used to go in the back door of the bowling alleys and only could bowl from 12 midnight to 4 a.m. in horrendous conditions. And in fact in 1933, they started their own bowling association called the National Bowling Association because the, the, the major bowling organization had a white-only clause. And these people are I would guess about 30 to 40,000 strong here in this country, and the people who put it together fought a tremendous battle just so that we could turn on our TV last year and see Bobby Williams, the first black on the pro bowling circuit. So I think that if we're talking about the role of sport in a struggle for Black survival, and the role that these individuals have played in making a better place for Black Americans, and to make the society live up to the creed of the American doctrine, then they deserve a niche of recognition for all of their energies and for all of the, the whiplashes that they bore.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:36.260
Now in a sense, the main focus of the Black Sports Hall of Fame is on ethnic consciousness through sports.

Allan P. Barron 00:10:43.191
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:10:43.530
And is not intended to be a substitute for people's rightful admission to whatever hall of fame exist in whatever sport.

Allan P. Barron 00:10:50.370
Exactly. And even though with that we would like to to feel very strong about the fact that everybody was in that hall of fame earned a spot in that hall of fame because he or she was truly a great athlete in his time. People have, some of the criteria that the current Halls of Fame use are you must no longer be active. Some of them almost, are almost to the point where you must almost be dead.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:17.220
Dead.

Allan P. Barron 00:11:17.224
You know, to try to get in. I think that's ridiculous. I think that if you look at a guy like Wilt Chamberlain, who when you open the basketball record books, and he holds eleven records and ain't nobody ever--and I say ain't to be emphatic--going to catch Chamberlain in some of the records that he holds he should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. He's a great guy. He should be given his flowers while he is alive. Another case which is just the opposite is Bob Beamon, who has never been a professional athlete, but who jumped an unprecedented 29 feet two and a half inches in the Olympic Games in 1968 and ain't nobody gonna jump that I think in our lifetimes again. The nearest people I was...

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:52.751
I said that when Jesse did 26 seven...

Allan P. Barron 00:11:54.871
But look at how long it took to get Jesse's record.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:11:55.357
Okay.

Allan P. Barron 00:11:57.990
I said in our lifetime, Dr. Brown. So that we think that Bob was that particular act earned him a niche in the Hall of Fame.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:09.121
Because it's very interesting thing when you talk about halls of fame regardless of their ethnic consciousness. And that is what really is a purpose of a hall of hame because on one hand a record is as dead as the day it's made.

Allan P. Barron 00:12:21.301
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:21.931
And the other hand the thrills of sport is in the doing of it. But of course anybody who's ever hung around bars knows at least 90 percent of the conversation deals with what somebody did then...

Allan P. Barron 00:12:35.062
As in barbershops. Yeah.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:38.070
All right, let's talk about Black Sports Magazine because that's an intriguing idea. Being a sports fan myself, the minute I heard about it, I was, I may have been one of your first subscribers.

Allan P. Barron 00:12:48.181
Oh I appreciate that.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:12:49.141
And I just send it in. But even at that time I identified with, and I said, 'Well gee why black sports magazines? I said I identify with it. I go out to buy it. To subscribe to it. And I say, 'Why black sports magazine?' What are you trying to do that, let's say, sports magazine Sports Illustrated doesn't do?

Allan P. Barron 00:13:06.870
I have to admit to one thing first and that is all of my education is in the field of psychology. And I went into that field because I didn't really understand a lot about me, you know personally. And how I didn't like the way people looked at me in the street and why I felt all these inferior things, and one of the things that you become painfully aware of is the fact that people are what they perceive themselves to be. That we can stimulate growth in certain areas just by presenting that kind of data. Well Black Sports Magazine is a, is a, communications vehicle. It's really what it is. We chose to do it through the theme of sports because in our community, sports permeates every economic level, every social level, every color level. I mean it's just that one silver thread that winds itself through all of our lives, especially in the black community. We could have started a magazine and called it Political Now or something, and I doubt that it would have had the receptivity that sports has in our community.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:07.772
Bet not as many people would read it.

Allan P. Barron 00:14:09.181
Oh exactly. Exactly. So what what we decided to do and what we're attempting to do with black sports is to provide a vehicle of communications to the black community about itself, center, centering particularly around the black athlete. And what we are, what we're hoping to do within what we think we're being at least us in a small way accomplishing it, what we are trying to do is to give an extension to that athlete, not just his scores and his runs or his hits, but to show that he is a human being and that he has problems and that he is, he does have the ability to manipulate business and to get involved sociologically in his community, and that he is a human being. And that he does, once the season ends, he doesn't go into hibernation and wait for the next season to come around. He goes on and lives. And this is the part of our particular lifestyle that the white sports magazines don't cover at all.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:14:59.610
Well I think you're right, but I would go further. I think that sports generically in our society play a socio-political role that is different from what it played back in the early 1900s where it was recreation and it was about the only thing that kept the sports pages going.

Allan P. Barron 00:15:17.401
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:15:17.941
Now sports in America are big business. And one of the things that happens is that black athletes do not get their share of all--not black athletes--black people of running the business of being involved in the business and all the various peripheral fashions. And because of the fact that the athlete is really the product of the system. Too many of our young black athletes get used up by the system, don't get their education, which probably is the greatest crime in the whole thing. And don't get any of the goodies that come along with it. Now what does your magazine doing to help alert the public, the black public in particular, to this consideration.

Allan P. Barron 00:16:02.070
I think there are two phases to that answer. One of them has to do specifically with the using of the product, the black athlete. Trying to bring about a level of awareness not only to him, but to parents about things like the rip off of college recruiting. And don't sign any papers until somebody who has been to college and knows it all that fine print is all about. We also try to face that same problem by helping little known athletes. A lot of dollars are thrown around loosely to guys who get a lot of ink, as it's called, or publicity. What we attempt to do is on a monthly basis we take high school and college kids, who you don't read about in the sports pages, but who are within their own rights dynamic athletes and we give them a write-up. We do three of each every month and as a result of it, we get called by professional teams, by colleges, saying, 'Do you know this kid at Weequahic High School in Newark? What kind of a kid is he?" And I ain't met a bad kid yet, so I always say, 'he's a great kid' and I check it out with his coach and say, 'you know you make sure he is a great kid because we just gave him an A plus recommendation'. The second side to that is there are 66 percent of the NBA and 44 percent of the NFL and 33 or 34 percent of national baseball are black or Hispanic ballplayers. The, the, major press writes about, writes to its constituency about its athletes. So 90 percent of the other sports books and magazines are about the white athlete. There are a ton of brothers out there who are super ballplayers. Billy Williams is one of them, a guy you don't see anything written by Billy Williams.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:37.102
That really isn't true. Billy Williams is getting a lot of--

Allan P. Barron 00:17:39.080
Well now. He's getting a lot of press. but Billy Williams. you know he didn't get the kind of press that he could have. I'll give you another example. A guy we're gonna do something with right now is Leroy Kelly. Kelly has been--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:50.730
He's a great ballplayer.

Allan P. Barron 00:17:51.231
I mean he's a great ballplayer. How many stories you seen about Kelly? You see--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:17:54.142
He's been playing on the losing team for the past five years. That has a little something to do with it.

Allan P. Barron 00:17:58.271
Yeah, but we're talking about individual effort again. OK.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:00.570
He's a great ballplayer

Allan P. Barron 00:18:00.884
He's

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:00.883
a

Allan P. Barron 00:18:00.884
great ballplayer.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:00.883
And

Allan P. Barron 00:18:00.884
I think everybody recognizes that. And that's the kind of guy that should be dealt with. But you mentioned Hispanic and I've heard some mixed reaction to that on both sides. The blacks say, 'well Hispanics aren't black' and some of the Hispanics say, 'we aren't black.' So how do you deal with that? How do you get around those concerns because like you say you-- Well--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:18:23.536
You met a few many times--

Allan P. Barron 00:18:23.700
We met a couple of guys who say things like that, but I'll be very candid with you we have not had occasion to have any Hispanic athlete come to us and say, 'No don't write about me I'm not Black'. The feeling is growing very strongly, in the, in the total community that people who are non-white are Black. If you're not, you know, Anglo- Saxon European origins, you're a black person, in concept if nothing more even, if they put on your passport Cuban and you're white. We had a very unique incident with Angel Cordero, who is probably one of the highest money winning jockeys in the country right now. When Cordero goes into the winner's circle, a lot of people never notice, he raises a clenched fist all the time. Now on his passport, he is considered white. A lot of people call him white. He sometimes says he's white, but when he talks with you, he says, 'I know where my heart is. I know what I have to do and I'm trying to represent black people.' So we have not had very much difficulty, in fact, we make a conscious effort to put Hispanic people in the magazine and on the covers, you know, and what we think are just numbers because they're great athletes. Our next issue has our current issue has Orlando Cepeda on the cover. And Orlando is, I mean, he's a great, great ballplayer. He happens to be Hispanic.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:19:42.510
This is one of the problems. I won't belabor this, is that some of the Hispanic people do have lots of black blood and identify them as such, and some others don't have lots of black blood, and don't want to be involved with that. And the question is that some people raise, 'Are we just trying to sweep in everybody to enlarge our circle?' Obviously some of the elements of oppression are the same. But maybe you ought to, maybe you will have a Spanish edition of Black Sports, which might become widely circulated in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico and places like that. Have you thought about that?

Allan P. Barron 00:20:21.960
Yes we have thought about that. But the sales of Black Sports Magazine in that particular section of the world is so high that it gives us any indication that people are accepting the fact that Black Sports Magazine is giving them and communicating to them the kinds of stories that they want to read about the athletes and athletes that they're concerned about. You know and again, not to, not to belabor it, but I have never met an athlete, Hispanic athlete, who has told me he's white. Never.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:48.590
You may have it a little bit different than I. I won't name the names--

Allan P. Barron 00:20:50.332
Don't name the names--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:50.661
Because I don't want to embarrass.

Allan P. Barron 00:20:52.061
Yeah, Right.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:52.341
But what about the conflict that does exist on some teams, particularly baseball teams, between the black and Hispanic athletes.

Allan P. Barron 00:20:59.391
You know I think--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:20:59.960
Have you ever written about that or looked into that?

Allan P. Barron 00:21:02.300
We are currently looking into that because that's a very unique situation. A lot of times, and I'm really flying by the seat of my pants based upon just a couple of interviews thus far, but a lot of times it looks like it's a created situation. You know, it's almost like divide and conquer. If you'll notice baseball is becoming more and more Spanish every day. And the primary reason is because, as the black athlete becomes more aware of what this thing is about, he's asking for bigger dollars. So they're not signing him as readily as they're going down in the Caribbean and bringing these guys in.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:21:33.082
Not only that many athletes are multi-talented and basketball and football have a greater potential at least it's the perceived potential. And if you add onto it the supposed education that they get when they take college scholarships, baseball is in a difficult situation, a matter of fact baseball, unless they do something very swiftly, will probably die as a major sport and be supplanted by the more violent sports.

Allan P. Barron 00:22:00.170
I think so. And of course you know the other thing that baseball has going against it is the minor league system, where a guy goes to college, or whatever he does, and goes into baseball, and he plays in the minors, you know, for three, four years.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:11.601
Who wants to do that?

Allan P. Barron 00:22:12.291
Right exactly, whereas football guy comes right out of college and he lets--

00:22:15.191
No you know he didn't come out of the college. He comes out of the minor leagues which you call college.

Allan P. Barron 00:22:18.710
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:19.351
And that's one of the things we have to deal with. That's another part of our system.

Allan P. Barron 00:22:22.561
Right. Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:22:23.421
Well let's talk about another interest that you have, which has to do with the use of sports for drug abuse education among Black and Hispanic youth.

Allan P. Barron 00:22:32.510
There is a very definite psychological train of thought that says if, if I reach your interest level I can teach you anything. And of course sports is the thing that is a very high interest in our community right now. And there are some very well-run programs around the country where people are utilizing sports to deter the use of drugs. There is a little saying that says, in essence it says, 'an active sport mind cannot deal with the drug needle', you know.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:01.730
So wait a minute now you said that and I happen to agree with that. On the other hand immediately when you said that all I could see was alleged use of drugs by this athlete, and that athlete, by that athlete, and I'm not talking about someone who was picked up for smoking weed. I'm talking about the allegations that many athletes use a variety of drugs to stimulate their behaviors, their performance, to help their muscles to grow, and so on. So when we make a cliche statement like athlete doesn't use drugs and then you see the other thing in the newspaper, then you have to figure out how do you balance those off.

Allan P. Barron 00:23:35.690
Well let me just say this. Let's you and I not be naive. Let us say that sports is a microcosm of the total society.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:23:41.991
Exactly.

Allan P. Barron 00:23:42.591
And if people are doing it in colleges and in the streets, they're doing it and all the pro ranks and all the sports organizations in this country. So let's not be fools and say that they are not doing it. Anytime one of the commissioners stand up say, 'nobody in my organization is shooting heroin or snorting coke'. He's a fool. Let's put it that that coldly. What we're trying to do, and the thing that we want to emphasize, is that we want to get to these people prior to that time. We want to start orientated them at a young age, at the little league age. You know at the Babe Ruth and the Pop Warner League, you don't need those things. You can play a football game without taking barbiturates and amphetamines to try and get high to play better.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:19.550
It's very interesting because when this thing came up with NFL, several players spoke with righteous indignation. But some other guy said, 'Yeah we know it happens and we want to stop it.' And I gather you, your organization and the idea is, that yeah you do know it happens, but you want to stop it. You're really saying that an athlete, or anybody else, doesn't really need this type of artificial support in order to get through life.

Allan P. Barron 00:24:43.211
That's--.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:43.892
He has something else he can relate---

Allan P. Barron 00:24:44.901
Exactly.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:24:45.441
to as sports.

Allan P. Barron 00:24:46.220
As much of a sportsman as you are, you know that the thrill of the game gets you so excited. your adrenaline get to flowing, and you don't really need another stimulant or depressant to try and get you into the game. I think that Kermit Alexander very aptly put it the other day when he said that a lot of times undue pressure is put on the athlete by owners, by head coaches, and trainers that he must perform better. You know they grade you as a B ball player, means that you get 90 percent of your blocks and catch 90 percent of your passes or whatever. And the moment--

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:14.480
In my league, that's A.

Allan P. Barron 00:25:18.900
OK. They grade you as a, as a, they give you a certain grade.

Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. 00:25:21.781
I understand.

Allan P. Barron 00:25:22.242
And the moment you blow, they say, 'well you know you're down, you're not, you're not doing it' and the little trainer has got this little bottle in his back back, pocket, and if you take a couple of these in the second half, you'll be up. I know that I know that flu had you down, but take a couple of these, it's gonna make you feel better. I mean, I've seen guys pop 16 pills before the first half was over. And then the start the third quarter, they took another five or six pills. And then they didn't know they were until late Tuesday--

Right, wasted for a couple of days after that, and of course that's unconscionable. And of course what you're saying, and I think the approach you're into is a very good one, is let's take our athletes, those who really understand where this is coming from, and work on our person-to-person basis with young kids on their teams in their communities. So they really will understand the realities because you can't really act as though it doesn't exist. It does exist. And the question now that we know it exists what are we gonna do about it.

One of them, or one of the most receptive organizations that we've had the pleasure, the privilege and the pleasure of working with has been the NBA and commissioner Walter Kennedy. We have a program that we're going to implement next month, which will touch every high school in America. And we'll touch every high school coach and we'll touch every high school basketball player. And we're going to try and instill in him through a national game, which will be played in a major auditorium on national television, in conjunction with the NBA, that he doesn't need this kind of thing and we're going to try and create in him the desire to be a leader, so that he can't tear himself down by dealing with drugs on that level because everybody's going to look at him as saying damn Roscoe, you're a dynamite guy. You know, how can he possibly not go out and tear his pants and know that all these he's letting down so many people. And the NBA has been very receptive to working on a program like this, and we just feel so positive this is just a good step utilizing high school basketball on a kind of an awareness and a drug preventative campaign. It's the first time it's being done in the country.

Okay Allan, I think you've really shown us today on tonight on " Soul of Reason" just where Black Sports Magazine is coming from, what we're trying to do through the Black Sports Hall of Fame, and most recently, what you've been talking about, about the use of sports as a medium for controlling drug abuse and drug addiction among our youth. And I'd like to wish you lots of good luck with Black Sports and we'll see what happens with the Hall of Fame over the next few years. Thanks for being our guests Allen Barron of Black Sports Magazine.
